10.1016/j.mri.2022.12.003,36496097.0,,Diffusion radiomics for subtyping and clustering in autism spectrum disorder: A preclinical study,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent, heterogenous neurodevelopmental disorder. Neuroimaging methods such as functional, structural, and diffusion MRI have been used to identify candidate imaging biomarkers for ASD, but current findings remain non-specific and likely arise from the heterogeneity present in ASD. To account for this, efforts to subtype ASD have emerged as a potential strategy for both the study of ASD and advancement of tailored behavioral therapies and therapeutics. Towards these ends, to improve upon current neuroimaging methods, we propose combining biologically sensitive neurite orientation dispersion and density index (NODDI) diffusion MR imaging with radiomics image processing to create a new methodological approach that, we hypothesize, can sensitively and specifically capture neurobiology. We demonstrate this method can sensitively distinguish differences between four genetically distinct rat models of ASD (Fmr1, Pten, Nrxn1, Disc1). Further, we demonstrate diffusion radiomic analyses hold promise for subtyping in ASD as we show unsupervised clustering of NODDI radiomic data generates clusters specific to the underlying genetic differences between the animal models. Taken together, our findings suggest the unique application of radiomic analysis on NODDI diffusion MRI may have the capacity to sensitively and specifically disambiguate the neurobiological heterogeneity present in the ASD population.","Ajay Paul Singh,Vansh Jain,Jerry Yu",,2023.0

10.3389/fonc.2021.771787,,,Radiomics for Identification and Prediction in Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Review of Studies,"Metastatic Prostate Cancer (mPCa) is associated with a poor patient prognosis. mPCa spreads throughout the body, often to bones, with spatial and temporal variations that make the clinical management of the disease difficult. The evolution of the disease leads to spatial heterogeneity that is extremely difficult to characterise with solid biopsies. Imaging provides the opportunity to quantify disease spread. Advanced image analytics methods, including radiomics, offer the opportunity to characterise heterogeneity beyond what can be achieved with simple assessment. Radiomics analysis has the potential to yield useful quantitative imaging biomarkers that can improve the early detection of mPCa, predict disease progression, assess response, and potentially inform the choice of treatment procedures. Traditional radiomics analysis involves modelling with hand-crafted features designed using significant domain knowledge. On the other hand, artificial intelligence techniques such as deep learning can facilitate end-to-end automated feature extraction and model generation with minimal human intervention. Radiomics models have the potential to become vital pieces in the oncology workflow, however, the current limitations of the field, such as limited reproducibility, are impeding their translation into clinical practice. This review provides an overview of the radiomics methodology, detailing critical aspects affecting the reproducibility of features, and providing examples of how artificial intelligence techniques can be incorporated into the workflow. The current landscape of publications utilising radiomics methods in the assessment and treatment of mPCa are surveyed and reviewed. Associated studies have incorporated information from multiple imaging modalities, including bone scintigraphy, CT, PET with varying tracers, multiparametric MRI together with clinical covariates, spanning the prediction of progression through to overall survival in varying cohorts. The methodological quality of each study is quantified using the radiomics quality score. Multiple deficits were identified, with the lack of prospective design and external validation highlighted as major impediments to clinical translation. These results inform some recommendations for future directions of the field.","Jake Kendrick,Jake Kendrick,Roslyn J. Francis,Roslyn J.

However, current radiological markers lack specificity and individualized diagnostic capability, and the interactions between the various markers are not fully clear. Radiomics, a data-driven analysis of radiological images, offers a promising approach to improve evaluation and deepen the understanding of spinal changes related to LBP. This study investigated possible associations between vertebral changes and annular fissures using radiomics. A dataset of 61 LBP patients who underwent conventional magnetic resonance imaging followed by discography was analyzed. Radiomics features were extracted from segmented vertebrae and carefully reduced to identify the most relevant features associated with annular fissures. The results revealed three important texture features that display concentrated high-intensity gray levels, extensive regions with elevated gray levels, and localized areas with reduced gray levels within the vertebrae. These features highlight patterns within vertebrae that conventional classification systems cannot reflect on distinguishing between vertebrae adjacent to an intervertebral disc with or without an annular fissure. As such, the present study reveals associations that contribute to the understanding of pathophysiology and may provide improved diagnostics of LBP.","Christian Waldenberg,Helena Brisby,Hanna Hebelka,Kerstin Lagerstrand",,2023.0

The field of radiological imaging has experienced growth in recent years, which could be boosted by the advent of artificial intelligence. One of the latest innovations in artificial intelligence is radiomics, which is based on the fact that a large amount of quantitative data can be extracted from radiological images, from which patterns can be identified and associated with specific pathologies. Since its inception, radiomics has been particularly associated with the field of oncology and has shown promising results in a wide range of clinical situations. The performance of radiomics in non-tumour pathologies has been increasingly explored in recent years, and the results continue to be promising.

Our goal is to develop machine learning (ML)-based radiomic models based on pre-treatment imaging for predicting the outcomes of lumbar nucleoplasty (LNP), which is one of the interventional therapies for LDDD.The input data included general patient characteristics, perioperative medical and surgical details, and pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results from 181 LDDD patients receiving lumbar nucleoplasty. Post-treatment pain improvements were categorized as clinically significant (defined as a ≥80% decrease in the visual analog scale) or non-significant. To develop the ML models, T2-weighted MRI images were subjected to radiomic feature extraction, which was combined with physiological clinical parameters. After data processing, we developed five ML models: support vector machine, light gradient boosting machine, extreme gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting random forest, and improved random forest. Model performance was measured by evaluating indicators, such as the confusion matrix, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which were acquired using an 8:2 allocation of training to testing sequences.Among the five ML models, the improved random forest algorithm had the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.76, a sensitivity of 0.69, a specificity of 0.83, an F1 score of 0.73, and an AUC of 0.77. The most influential clinical features included in the ML models were pre-operative VAS and age. In contrast, the most influential radiomic features had the correlation coefficient and gray-scale co-occurrence matrix.We developed an ML-based model for predicting pain improvement after LNP for patients with LDDD. We hope this tool will provide both doctors and patients with better information for therapeutic planning and decision-making.","Po-Fan Chiu,Robert Chen-Hao Chang,Yung-Chi Lai,Kuo-Chen Wu,Kuan-Pin Wang,You-Pen Chiu,Hui-Ru Ji,Chia Hung Kao,Cheng-Di Chiu",,2023.0

10.1148/radiol.211604,35230182.0,,A Novel Benchmarking Approach to Assess the Agreement among Radiomic Tools,"Background The translation of radiomic models into clinical practice is hindered by the limited reproducibility of features across software and studies. Standardization is needed to accelerate this process and to bring radiomics closer to clinical deployment. Purpose To assess the standardization level of seven radiomic software programs and investigate software agreement as a function of built-in image preprocessing (eg, interpolation and discretization), feature aggregation methods, and the morphological characteristics (ie, volume and shape) of the region of interest (ROI). Materials and Methods The study was organized into two phases: In phase I, the two Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) phantoms were used to evaluate the IBSI compliance of seven software programs. In phase II, the reproducibility of all IBSI-standardized radiomic features across tools was assessed with two custom Italian multicenter Shared Understanding of Radiomic Extractors (ImSURE) digital phantoms that allowed, in conjunction with a systematic feature extraction, observations on whether and how feature matches between program pairs varied depending on the preprocessing steps, aggregation methods, and ROI characteristics. Results In phase I, the software programs showed different levels of completeness (ie, the number of computable IBSI benchmark values). However, the IBSI-compliance assessment revealed that they were all standardized in terms of feature implementation. When considering additional preprocessing steps, for each individual program, match percentages fell by up to 30%. In phase II, the ImSURE phantoms showed that software agreement was dependent on discretization and aggregation as well as on ROI shape and volume factors. Conclusion The agreement of radiomic software varied in relation to factors that had already been standardized (eg, interpolation and discretization methods) and factors that need standardization. Both dependences must be resolved to ensure the reproducibility of radiomic features and to pave the way toward the clinical adoption of radiomic models. © RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Implementation of 18-fluorine-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( 18 F-FDG PET/CT) radiomics captures various disorders in non-invasive and high-throughput manner. 18 F-FDG PET/CT accurately identifies the metabolic and anatomical changes during cancer progression. Therefore, the application of 18 F-FDG PET/CT in the field of oncology is well established. Clinical application of 18 F-FDG PET/CT radiomics in lung infection and inflammation is also an emerging field. Combination of bioinformatics approaches or textual analysis allows radiomics to extract additional information to predict cell biology at the micro-level. However, radiomics texture analysis is affected by several factors associated with image acquisition and processing. At present, researchers are working on mitigating these interrupters and developing standardised workflow for texture biomarker establishment. This review article focuses on the application of 18 F-FDG PET/CT in detecting lung diseases specifically on cancer, infection and inflammation. An overview of different approaches and challenges encountered on standardisation of 18 F-FDG PET/CT technique has also been highlighted.

10.3389/fneur.2022.905761,35903112.0,,Cervical Cancer Imaging Features Associated With ADRB1 as a Risk Factor for Cerebral Neurovascular Metastases,"Bioinformatics tools are used to create a clinical prediction model for cervical cancer metastasis and to investigate the neurovascular-related genes that are involved in brain metastasis of cervical cancer. One hundred eighteen patients with cervical cancer were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of metastases, and the clinical data and imaging findings of the two groups were compared retrospectively. The nomogram-based model was successfully constructed by taking into account four clinical characteristics (age, stage, N, and T) as well as one imaging characteristic (original_glszm_GrayLevelVariance Rad-score). In patients with cervical cancer, headaches and vomiting were more often reported in the brain metastasis group than in the other metastasis groups. According to the TCGA data, mRNA differential gene expression analysis of patients with cervical cancer revealed an increase in the expression of neurovascular-related gene Adrenoceptor Beta 1 ( ADRB1 ) in the brain metastasis group. An analysis of the correlation between imaging features and ADRB1 expression revealed that ADRB1 expression was significantly higher in the low Rad-score group compared with the high Rad-score group ( P = 0.025). Therefore, ADRB1 expression in cervical cancer was correlated with imaging features and was associated as a risk factor for cerebral neurovascular metastases. This study developed a nomogram prediction model for cervical cancer metastasis using age, stage, N, T and original_glszm_GrayLevelVariance. As a risk factor associated with the development of cerebral neurovascular metastases of cervical cancer, ADRB1 expression was significantly higher in brain metastases from cervical cancer.","Xingju Zheng,Xingju Zheng,Shilin Xu,Shilin Xu,JiaYing Wu,Jiaying Wu",Frontiers in Neurology,2022.0

A variety of image and feature based harmonization methods has been developed to compensate for these effects; however, to the best of our knowledge, none of these techniques has been established as the most effective in the analysis pipeline so far.

Successful application of radiomics features as imaging biomarkers, however, is dependent on the robustness of the approach to the variation in each step of the modeling workflow. Variation in the input image quality is one of the main sources that impacts the reproducibility of radiomics analysis when a model is applied to broader range of medical imaging data. The quality of medical image is generally affected by both the scanner related factors such as image acquisition/reconstruction settings and the patient related factors such as patient motion. This article aimed to review the published literatures in this field that reported the impact of various imaging factors on the radiomics features through the change in image quality. The literatures were categorized by different imaging modalities and also tabulated based on the imaging parameters and the class of radiomics features included in the study.

10.1097/rli.0000000000000921,36070524.0,,Influence of Image Processing on Radiomic Features From Magnetic Resonance Imaging.,"Before implementing radiomics in routine clinical practice, comprehensive knowledge about the repeatability and reproducibility of radiomic features is required. The aim of this study was to systematically investigate the influence of image processing parameters on radiomic features from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in terms of feature values as well as test-retest repeatability.Utilizing a phantom consisting of 4 onions, 4 limes, 4 kiwifruits, and 4 apples, we acquired a test-retest dataset featuring 3 of the most commonly used MRI sequences on a 3 T scanner, namely, a T1-weighted, a T2-weighted, and a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, each at high and low resolution. After semiautomatic image segmentation, image processing with systematic variation of image processing parameters was performed, including spatial resampling, intensity discretization, and intensity rescaling. For each respective image processing setting, a total of 45 radiomic features were extracted, corresponding to the following 7 matrices/feature classes: conventional indices, histogram matrix, shape matrix, gray-level zone length matrix, gray-level run length matrix, neighboring gray-level dependence matrix, and gray-level cooccurrence matrix. Systematic differences of individual features between different resampling steps were assessed using 1-way analysis of variance with Tukey-type post hoc comparisons to adjust for multiple testing. Test-retest repeatability of radiomic features was measured using the concordance correlation coefficient, dynamic range, and intraclass correlation coefficient.Image processing influenced radiological feature values. Regardless of the acquired sequence and feature class, significant differences (P < 0.05) in feature values were found when the size of the resampled voxels was too large, that is, bigger than 3 mm. Almost all higher-order features depended strongly on intensity discretization. The effects of intensity rescaling were negligible except for some features derived from T1-weighted sequences. For all sequences, the percentage of repeatable features (concordance correlation coefficient and dynamic range ≥ 0.9) varied considerably depending on the image processing settings. The optimal image processing setting to achieve the highest percentage of stable features varied per sequence. Irrespective of image processing, the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence in high-resolution overall yielded the highest number of stable features in comparison with the other sequences (89% vs 64%-78% for the respective optimal image processing settings). Across all sequences, the most repeatable features were generally obtained for a spatial resampling close to the originally acquired voxel size and an intensity discretization to at least 32 bins.Variation of image processing parameters has a significant impact on the values of radiomic features as well as their repeatability. Furthermore, the optimal image processing parameters differ for each MRI sequence. Therefore, it is recommended that these processing parameters be determined in corresponding test-retest scans before clinical application. Extensive repeatability, reproducibility, and validation studies as well as standardization are required before quantitative image analysis and radiomics can be reliably translated into routine clinical care.","Barbara Wichtmann,Barbara D.

Although several risk factors of RBP have been reported, it is still difficult to estimate the risk of RBP preoperatively. Radiomics is helpful for disease diagnosis and outcome prediction by establishing complementary relationships between human-recognizable and computer-extracted features. However, musculoskeletal radiomics investigations are less frequently reported.This study aims to establish a radiomics score (rad-score) based nomogram for the preoperative prediction of RBP in OVCF patients.The training cohort of 731 OVCF patients was used for nomogram development, and the validation cohort was utilized for performance test. RBP was determined as the score of visual analogue scale ≥ 4 at both 3 and 30 days following surgery. After normalization, the RBP-related radiomics features were selected to create rad-scores. These rad-scores, along with the RBP predictors initially identified by univariate analyses, were included in the multivariate analysis to establish a nomogram for the assessment of the RBP risk in OVCF patients preoperatively.A total of 81 patients (11.2%) developed RBP postoperatively. We finally selected 8 radiomics features from 1316 features extracted from each segmented image to determine the rad-score. Multivariate analysis revealed that the rad-score plus bone mineral density, intravertebral cleft, and thoracolumbar fascia injury were independent factors of RBP. Our nomograms based on these factors demonstrated good discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility in both training and validation cohorts. Furthermore, it achieved better performance than the rad-score itself, as well as the nomogram only incorporating regular features.We developed and validated a nomogram incorporating the rad-score and regular features for preoperative prediction of the RBP risk in OVCF patients, which contributed to improved surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction.","Ge Chen,Zhe Chen,Lin Yan,Yuehuan Zheng,Peng Cao,Xiaoyong Chen",,2022.0

In recent years, in addition to genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, radiomic has attracted the interest of more and more researchers. Compared to other omics, radiomics can be perfectly integrated with clinical data, even with the pathology and molecular biomarker, so that the study can be closer to the clinical reality and more revealing of the tumor development. Mass data will also be generated in this process. Machine learning, due to its own characteristics, has a unique advantage in processing massive radiomic data. By analyzing mass amounts of data with strong clinical relevance, people can construct models that more accurately reflect tumor development and progression, thereby providing the possibility of personalized and sequential treatment of patients. As one of the cancer types whose treatment and diagnosis rely on imaging examination, radiomics has a very broad application prospect in head and neck cancers (HNC).

METHODS Forty-nine patients were retrospectively analyzed. Tumor contouring was performed manually by four different operators and with a semi-automatic edge-based segmentation (SAEB) algorithm. Three SUVmax fixed thresholds (20, 30, 40%) were applied. Fifty-one RFs were extracted applying two different intensity rescale factors for gray-level discretization: one absolute (AR60 = SUV from 0 to 60) and one relative (RR = min-max of the VOI SUV). Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was calculated to quantify segmentation agreement between different segmentation methods. The impact of segmentation and discretization on RFs was assessed by intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and the coefficient of variance (COVL). The RFs' correlation with volume and SUVmax was analyzed by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficients. RESULTS DSC mean value was 0.75 ± 0.11 (0.45-0.92) between SAEB and operators and 0.78 ± 0.09 (0.36-0.97), among the four manual segmentations. The study showed high robustness (ICC >0.9): (a) in 64.7% of RFs for segmentation methods using AR60, improved by applying SUVmax threshold of 40% (86.5%); (b) in 50.9% of RFs for different SUVmax thresholds using AR60; and (c) in 37% of RFs for discretization settings using different segmentation methods. Several RFs were not correlated with volume and SUVmax. CONCLUSIONS RFs robustness to manual segmentation resulted higher in NET 68Ga-DOTA-TOC images compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT images. Forty percent SUVmax thresholds yield superior RFs stability among operators, however leading to a possible loss of biological information. SAEB segmentation appears to be an optimal alternative to manual segmentation, but further validations are needed. Finally, discretization settings highly impacted on RFs robustness and should always be stated.","Virginia Liberini,Bruno De Santi,Virginia Liberini,Osvaldo Rampado,Bruno De Santi,Osvaldo Rampado,E.

10.3390/cancers13102469,,,Machine Learning and Radiomics Applications in Esophageal Cancers Using Non-Invasive Imaging Methods-A Critical Review of Literature.,"Esophageal cancer (EC) is of public health significance as one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Accurate staging, treatment planning and prognostication in EC patients are of vital importance. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques demonstrate their potential to provide novel quantitative imaging markers in medical imaging. Radiomics approaches that could quantify medical images into high-dimensional data have been shown to improve the imaging-based classification system in characterizing the heterogeneity of primary tumors and lymph nodes in EC patients. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence of the most recent developments in ML application in imaging pertinent to EC patient care. According to the published results, ML models evaluating treatment response and lymph node metastasis achieve reliable predictions, ranging from acceptable to outstanding in their validation groups. Patients stratified by ML models in different risk groups have a significant or borderline significant difference in survival outcomes. Prospective large multi-center studies are suggested to improve the generalizability of ML techniques with standardized imaging protocols and harmonization between different centers.","Chenyi Xie,Chenyi Xie,Chun Pang,Benjamin Chan,Chun-Lap Pang,Chun-Lap Pang,Emily Y.

10.17691/stm2021.13.2.11,,,Radiomics and Digital Image Texture Analysis in Oncology (Review).,"One of the most promising areas of diagnosis and prognosis of diseases is radiomics, a science combining radiology, mathematical modeling, and deep machine learning. The main concept of radiomics is image biomarkers (IBMs), the parameters characterizing various pathological changes and calculated based on the analysis of digital image texture. IBMs are used for quantitative assessment of digital imaging results (CT, MRI, ultrasound, PET). The use of IBMs in the form of ""virtual biopsy"" is of particular relevance in oncology. The article provides the basic concepts of radiomics identifying the main stages of obtaining IBMs: data collection and preprocessing, tumor segmentation, data detection and extraction, modeling, statistical processing, and data validation. The authors have analyzed the possibilities of using IBMs in oncology, describing the currently known features and advantages of using radiomics and image texture analysis in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. The limitations and problems associated with the use of radiomics data are considered. Although the novel effective tool for performing virtual biopsy of human tissue is at the development stage, quite a few projects have already been implemented, and medical software packages for radiomics analysis of digital images have been created.","Andrey Litvin,D.

10.3748/wjg.v27.i32.5306,,,Radiomics and machine learning applications in rectal cancer: Current update and future perspectives.,"The high incidence of rectal cancer in both sexes makes it one of the most common tumors, with significant morbidity and mortality rates. To define the best treatment option and optimize patient outcome, several rectal cancer biological variables must be evaluated. Currently, medical imaging plays a crucial role in the characterization of this disease, and it often requires a multimodal approach. Magnetic resonance imaging is the first-choice imaging modality for local staging and restaging and can be used to detect high-risk prognostic factors. Computed tomography is widely adopted for the detection of distant metastases. However, conventional imaging has recognized limitations, and many rectal cancer characteristics remain assessable only after surgery and histopathology evaluation. There is a growing interest in artificial intelligence applications in medicine, and imaging is by no means an exception. The introduction of radiomics, which allows the extraction of quantitative features that reflect tumor heterogeneity, allows the mining of data in medical images and paved the way for the identification of potential new imaging biomarkers. To manage such a huge amount of data, the use of machine learning algorithms has been proposed. Indeed, without prior explicit programming, they can be employed to build prediction models to support clinical decision making. In this review, current applications and future perspectives of artificial intelligence in medical imaging of rectal cancer are presented, with an imaging modality-based approach and a keen eye on unsolved issues. The results are promising, but the road ahead for translation in clinical practice is rather long.","Arnaldo Stanzione,Francesco Verde,Arnaldo Stanzione,Francesco Verde,Valeria Romeo,Francesca Boccadifuoco,Valeria Romeo,Pier Paolo Mainenti,Francesca Boccadifuoco,Simone Maurea,Pier Paolo Mainenti,Simone Maurea",World Journal of Gastroenterology,2021.0

Radiomic features (11 feature-categories) were extracted in 3D from contrast-enhanced (CE)-CT images of gross-tumor-volumes using 'in-house' software ('ROdiomiX') developed and validated following the image-biomarker-standardization-initiative (IBSI) guidelines. Six clinical factors were investigated: Age-at-Diagnosis, Gender, Total-Charlson, Alcohol-Use, Smoking-History, and T-Stage. A Least-Absolute-Shrinkage-and-Selection-Operation (Lasso) technique combined with a Generalized-Linear-Model (Lasso-GLM) were applied to perform regularization in the radiomic and clinical feature spaces to identify the ranking of optimal feature subsets with most representative information for prediction of HPV. Lasso-GLM models/classifiers based on clinical factors only, radiomics only, and combined clinical and radiomics (ensemble/integrated) were constructed using random-permutation-sampling. Tests of significance (One-way ANOVA), average Area-Under-Receiver-Operating-Characteristic (AUC), and Positive and Negative Predictive values (PPV and NPV) were computed to estimate the generalization-error and prediction performance of the classifiers.Results:Five clinical factors, including T-stage, smoking status, and age, and 14 radiomic features, including tumor morphology, and intensity contrast were found to be statistically significant discriminators between HPV positive and negative cohorts. Performances for prediction of HPV for the 3 classifiers were: Radiomics-Lasso-GLM: AUC/PPV/NPV=0.789/0.755/0.805; Clinical-Lasso-GLM: 0.676/0.747/0.672, and Integrated/Ensemble-Lasso-GLM: 0.895/0.874/0.844. Results imply that the radiomics-based classifier enabled better characterization and performance prediction of HPV relative to clinical factors, and that the combination of both radiomics and clinical factors yields even higher accuracy characterization and predictive performance.Conclusion:Albeit subject to confirmation in a larger cohort, this pilot study presents encouraging results in support of the role of radiomic features towards characterization of HPV in patients with OPSCC.","Hassan Bagher‐Ebadian,Hassan Bagher Ebadian,Farzan Siddiqui,Farzan Siddiqui,Ahmed I Ghanem,Ahmed I Ghanem,Simeng Zhu,Simeng Zhu,Mei Lü,Mei Lu,Mei Lu,Benjamin Movsas,Indrin J.

Methods  According to image quality and clinical data availability, we eventually selected 70 ccRCC patients that underwent CT scans. Manual volume-of-interest (VOI) segmentation of each image was performed by an experienced radiologist using the 3D slicer software package. Prior to feature extraction, image pre-processing was performed on CT images to extract different image features, including wavelet, Laplacian of Gaussian, and resampling of the intensity values to 32, 64 and 128 bin levels. Overall, 2544 3D radiomics features were extracted from each VOI for each patient. Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) algorithm was used as feature selector. Four classification algorithms were used, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest Neighbor (KNN) and XGBoost. We used the Bootstrap resampling method to create validation sets. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUROC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to assess the performance of the classification models.    Results  The best single performance among 8 different models was achieved by the XGBoost model using a combination of radiomic features and clinical information (AUROC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity with 95% confidence interval were 0.95-0.98, 0.93-0.98, 0.93-0.96 and 1.0, respectively).    Conclusions  We developed a robust radiomics-based classifier that is capable of accurately predicting overall survival of RCC patients for prognosis of ccRCC patients. This signature may help identifying high-risk patients who require additional treatment and follow up regimens.","Mostafa Nazari,Mostafa Nazari,Isaac Shiri,Isaac Shiri,Habib Zaidi,Habib Zaidi",Computers in Biology and Medicine,2021.0

The mined data can be used to explore and establish new and undiscovered correlations between these imaging features and clinical end points. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) is a first-line imaging modality for evaluating coronary artery disease and has a primary role in the assessment of cardiac structures. Conventional interpretation of cardiac CT images relies mostly on subjective and qualitative analysis, as well as basic geometric quantification. To date, some proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated the feasibility and diagnostic performance of cardiac CT radiomics analysis. This review describes the current literature on radiomics in cardiac CT and discusses its advantages, challenges, and future directions.

It uses computer algorithms to extract and analyze a large number of quantitative features from radiological images. These radiomic features collectively describe unique patterns that can serve as digital fingerprints of disease. They may also capture imaging characteristics that are difficult or impossible to characterize by the human eye. The rapid development of this field is motivated by systems biology, facilitated by data analytics, and powered by artificial intelligence. Here, as part of Abdominal Radiology’s special issue on Quantitative Imaging, we provide an introduction to the field of radiomics. The technique is formally introduced as an advanced application of data analytics, with illustrating examples in abdominal radiology. Artificial intelligence is then presented as the main driving force of radiomics, and common techniques are defined and briefly compared. The complete step-by-step process of radiomic phenotyping is then broken down into five key phases. Potential pitfalls of each phase are highlighted, and recommendations are provided to reduce sources of variation, non-reproducibility, and error associated with radiomics.","Kyle Lafata,Yuqi Wang,Kyle Lafata,Brandon Konkel,Yuqi Wang,Fang‐Fang Yin,Brandon Konkel,Mustafa R.

10.17816/dd70479,,,The role of mammography in breast cancer radiomics,"Mammography is still the only screening method for breast cancer. Although digital mammography is the most common and widely used method for detecting breast cancer, it is ineffective at detecting and assessing intratumoral heterogeneity. Due to the small size of the tissue sample or tumor, biopsies often fail to represent the entire tumor. For this reason, selecting a treatment and determining a patient’s prognosis becomes difficult. In this case, medical imaging is a noninvasive approach that can provide a more comprehensive view of the entire tumor, act as a “virtual biopsy,” and be useful for monitoring disease progression and response to therapy.  Radiomics with texture analysis allows you to look at an image as a group of numerical data, moving beyond the usual visual perception and into a deeper analysis of digital, pixel data to improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis. Radiogenomics is a natural extension of radiomics that focuses on determining gene expression based on radiologic tumor phenotype. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the role of mammography in breast cancer radiomics and radiogenomics.  The article presents a literature review of relevant Russian scientific articles found in databases such as PubMed, Medline, Springer, eLibrary, and Google Scholar. The information obtained was then pooled, structured, and analyzed to examine the role of mammography in breast cancer screening radiomics.","Veronika G. Govorukhina,Veronika G.

10.1002/mp.14686,33370474.0,,Longitudinal acquisition repeatability of MRI radiomics features: An ACR MRI phantom study on two MRI scanners using a 3D T1W TSE sequence.,"PURPOSE To quantitatively assess the longitudinal acquisition repeatability of MRI radiomics features in a 3D T1-weighted (T1W) TSE sequence via a well-controlled prospective phantom study. METHODS 30 consecutive daily datasets of an ACR-MRI phantom were acquired on two 1.5T MRI-simulators using a 3D T1W TSE sequence. Images were blindly segmented by two observers. Post-acquisition processing was minimized but an intensity discretization (fixed bin-size of 25). 101 radiomics features (shape n=12; first-order n=16; texture n=73) were extracted. Longitudinal repeatability of each feature was evaluated by Pearson correlation and coefficient-of-variance (CV68% ). Inter-observer feature value agreement was also quantified using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis. A most repeatable radiomics feature set on both scanners was determined by feature coefficient-of-variance (CV68%  0.75), and the ratio of the inter-observer difference to the inter-observer mean δ 0.30). First-order and texture features had smaller inter-observer dependent variation than acquisition dependent variation. They also showed good inter-observer agreement on both scanners (A:ICC=0.80±0.23; B:ICC=0.80±0.22), independent of acquisition repeatability. The repeatable radiomics features in common on both scanners, including 12 shape features, 0 first-order features and 3 texture features, were determined as the most repeatable MRI radiomics feature set. CONCLUSIONS Radiomics features exhibited heterogeneous longitudinal repeatability, while the shape features were the most repeatable, in this phantom study with a 3D T1W TSE acquisition. The most repeatable radiomics feature set derived in this study should be helpful for the selection of reliable radiomics features in the future clinical use.","Oi Lei Wong,Jing Yuan,O Wong,Oi Lei Wong,Yihang Zhou,Jing Yuan,Yihang Zhou,Siu Ki Yu,Siu Ki Yu,K.Y.

10.3390/jpm11010008,33374569.0,,Preoperative Predicting the WHO/ISUP Nuclear Grade of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma by Computed Tomography-Based Radiomics Features.,"Nuclear grade is important for treatment selection and prognosis in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). This study aimed to determine the ability of preoperative four-phase multiphasic multidetector computed tomography (MDCT)-based radiomics features to predict the WHO/ISUP nuclear grade. In all 102 patients with histologically confirmed ccRCC, the training set (n = 62) and validation set (n = 40) were randomly assigned. In both datasets, patients were categorized according to the WHO/ISUP grading system into low-grade ccRCC (grades 1 and 2) and high-grade ccRCC (grades 3 and 4). The feature selection process consisted of three steps, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis, and the radiomics scores were developed using 48 radiomics features (10 in the unenhanced phase, 17 in the corticomedullary (CM) phase, 14 in the nephrographic (NP) phase, and 7 in the excretory phase). The radiomics score (Rad-Score) derived from the CM phase achieved the best predictive ability, with a sensitivity, specificity, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 90.91%, 95.00%, and 0.97 in the training set. In the validation set, the Rad-Score derived from the NP phase achieved the best predictive ability, with a sensitivity, specificity, and an AUC of 72.73%, 85.30%, and 0.84. We constructed a complex model, adding the radiomics score for each of the phases to the clinicoradiological characteristics, and found significantly better performance in the discrimination of the nuclear grades of ccRCCs in all MDCT phases. The highest AUC of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.92-1.00, p < 0.0001) was demonstrated for the CM phase. Our results showed that the MDCT radiomics features may play a role as potential imaging biomarkers to preoperatively predict the WHO/ISUP grade of ccRCCs.","Claudia-Gabriela Moldovanu,Bianca Boca,Claudia-Gabriela Moldovanu,Bianca Petresc,Bianca Boca,Andrei Lebovici,Attila Tamas-Szora,Andrei Lebovici,Attila Tamas-Szora,Attila Tamas-Szora,Diana Feier,Diana Feier,Nicolae Crişan,Nicolae Crisan,Iulia Andraș,Mircea Buruian,Iulia Andras,Mircea Marian Buruian,Mircea Marian Buruian",Journal of Personalized Medicine,2020.0

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contributes to the personalization of patient care but suffers from being highly dependent on acquisition and reconstruction parameters. Today, there are no guidelines regarding the optimal pre-processing of MR images in the context of radiomics, which is crucial for the generalization of published image-based signatures. This study aims to assess the impact of three different intensity normalization methods (Nyul, WhiteStripe, Z-Score) typically used in MRI together with two methods for intensity discretization (fixed bin size and fixed bin number). The impact of these methods was evaluated on first- and second-order radiomics features extracted from brain MRI, establishing a unified methodology for future radiomics studies. Two independent MRI datasets were used. The first one (DATASET1) included 20 institutional patients with WHO grade II and III gliomas who underwent post-contrast 3D axial T1-weighted (T1w-gd) and axial T2-weighted fluid attenuation inversion recovery (T2w-flair) sequences on two different MR devices (1.5T and 3.0T) with a 1-month delay. Jensen–Shannon divergence was used to compare pairs of intensity histograms before and after normalization. The stability of first-order and second-order features across the two acquisitions was analysed using the concordance correlation coefficient and the intra-class correlation coefficient. The second dataset (DATASET2) was extracted from the public TCIA database and included 108 patients with WHO grade II and III gliomas and 135 patients with WHO grade IV glioblastomas. The impact of normalization and discretization methods was evaluated based on a tumour grade classification task (balanced accuracy measurement) using five well-established machine learning algorithms. Intensity normalization highly improved the robustness of first-order features and the performances of subsequent classification models. For the T1w-gd sequence, the mean balanced accuracy for tumour grade classification was increased from 0.67 (95% CI 0.61–0.73) to 0.82 (95% CI 0.79–0.84, P=.006), 0.79 (95% CI 0.76–0.82, P=.021) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.80–0.85, P=.005), respectively, using the Nyul, WhiteStripe and Z-Score normalization methods compared to no normalization. The relative discretization makes unnecessary the use of intensity normalization for the second-order radiomics features. Even if the bin number for the discretization had a small impact on classification performances, a good compromise was obtained using the 32 bins considering both T1w-gd and T2w-flair sequences. No significant improvements in classification performances were observed using feature selection. A standardized pre-processing pipeline is proposed for the use of radiomics in MRI of brain tumours. For models based on first- and second-order features, we recommend normalizing images with the Z-Score method and adopting an absolute discretization approach. For second-order feature-based signatures, relative discretization can be used without prior normalization. In both cases, 32 bins for discretization are recommended. This study may pave the way for the multicentric development and validation of MR-based radiomics biomarkers.","Alexandre Carré,G. Klausner,A. Carré,Alexandre Carré,G.

Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to investigate, for the first time, the effect of image resampling/discretization and filtering on radiomic features estimation from quantitative CMR T1 and T2 mapping. Specifically, T1 and T2 maps of 26 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) were used to estimate 98 radiomic features for 7 different resampling voxel sizes (at fixed bin width), 9 different bin widths (at fixed resampling voxel size), and 7 different spatial filters (at fixed resampling voxel size/bin width). While we found a remarkable dependence of myocardial radiomic features from T1 and T2 mapping on image filters, many radiomic features showed a limited sensitivity to resampling voxel size/bin width, in terms of intraclass correlation coefficient (> 0.75) and coefficient of variation (< 30%). The estimate of most textural radiomic features showed a linear significant (p < 0.05) correlation with resampling voxel size/bin width. Overall, radiomic features from T2 maps have proven to be less sensitive to image preprocessing than those from T1 maps, especially when varying bin width. Our results might corroborate the potential of radiomics from T1/T2 mapping in HCM and hopefully in other myocardial diseases.","Daniela Marfisi,Carlo Tessa,Daniela Marfisi,Chiara Marzi,Carlo Tessa,Chiara Marzi,Jacopo Del Meglio,Jacopo Del Meglio,S.

In the last 5years, accumulating evidence has indicated that noninvasive advanced imaging analytics (i.e., radiomics) can reveal key components of tumor phenotype for multiple lesions at multiple time points over the course of treatment. Many groups using homegrown software have extracted engineered and deep quantitative features on 3-dimensional medical images for better spatial and longitudinal understanding of tumor biology and for the prediction of diverse outcomes. These developments could augment patient stratification and prognostication, buttressing emerging targeted therapeutic approaches. Unfortunately, the rapid growth in popularity of this immature scientific discipline has resulted in many early publications that miss key information or use underpowered patient data sets, without production of generalizable results. Quantitative imaging research is complex, and key principles should be followed to realize its full potential. The fields of quantitative imaging and radiomics in particular require a renewed focus on optimal study design and reporting practices, standardization, interpretability, data sharing, and clinical trials. Standardization of image acquisition, feature calculation, and statistical analysis (i.e., machine learning) are required for the field to move forward. A new data-sharing paradigm enacted among open and diverse participants (medical institutions, vendors and associations) should be embraced for faster development and comprehensive clinical validation of imaging biomarkers. In this review and critique of the field, we propose working principles and fundamental changes to the current scientific approach, with the goal of high-impact research and development of actionable prediction models that will yield more meaningful applications of precision cancer medicine.","Olivier Morin,Olivier Morin,Issam El Naqa,Martin Vallières,Martin Vallières,Arthur Jochems,Arthur Jochems,Henry C.

10.3389/fonc.2018.00131,29868465.0,,Exploring Applications of Radiomics in Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Head and Neck Cancer: A Systematic Review.,"Background: Radiomics has been widely investigated for non-invasive acquisition of quantita-tive textural information from anatomic structures. While the vast majority of radiomic analysis is performed on images obtained from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics has generated increased attention. In head and neck cancer (HNC), how-ever, attempts to perform consistent investigations are sparse, and it is unclear whether the result-ing textural features can be reproduced. To address this unmet need, we systematically reviewed the quality of existing MRI radiomics research in HNC. Methods: Literature search was conducted in accordance with guidelines established by Pre-ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Electronic data-bases were examined from January 1990 through November 2017 for common radiomic key-words. Eligible completed studies were then scored using a standardized checklist that we de-veloped from Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) guide-lines for reporting machine learning predictive model specifications and results in biomedical re-search, defined by Luo et al.(1). Descriptive statistics of checklist scores were populated, and a sub-group analysis of methodology items alone was conducted in comparison to overall scores. Results: Sixteen completed studies and four ongoing trials were selected for inclusion. Of the completed studies, the nasopharynx was the most common site of study (27.5%).MRI modalities varied with only four of the completed studies (25%) extracting radiomic features from a single sequence. Study sample sizes ranged between 13-118 patients (median of 20), and final radiomic signatures ranged from 2-279 features. Analyzed end-points included either segmentation or his-topathological classification parameters (44%) or prognostic and predictive biomarkers (56%) . Liu et al.(39) addressed the highest number of our checklist items (Total Score [TS]: 48), and a sub-group analysis of methodology checklist items alone did not demonstrate any difference in scoring trends between studies (Spearman’s ρ = 0.94 [p <.0001]). Conclusions: Although MRI radiomic applications demonstrate predictive potential in analyzing diverse HNC outcomes, methodological variances preclude accurate and collective interpretation of data.","Amit Jethanandani,Timothy A.

We studied 106 patients (69/37 NPC/CN, pathology confirmed), and extracted 57 radiomics features under different parameter settings. Robustness was assessed by the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Logistic regression with leave-one-out cross validation was used to generate classification probabilities, and diagnostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Varying averaging strategies and symmetry, 4/26 GLCM features showed poor range of pairwise ICCs of 0.02–0.98, while depicting good AUCs of 0.82–0.91. Varying distances, 5/26 GLCM features showed ICCs of 0.82–0.99 while corresponding AUCs were 0.52–0.91. 6/13 GLRLM features showed both high AUC (0.81–0.89) and high ICC (0.85–0.99) regarding to averaging strategies. 7/13 GLSZM features showed AUCs of 0.81–0.90 while having ICCs of 0.01–0.99 under different neighbourhoods. 2/5 NGTDM features showed AUCs of 0.81–0.85 while having ICCs of 0.19–0.89 for different window sizes. Differentiating a subset of NPC (stages I–II) form CN, both SumEntropy and SZLGE achieved significantly higher AUCs than metabolically active tumour volume (AUC: 0.91 vs. 0.72, p<0.01). Radiomics features depicting poor absolute-scale robustness regarding to parameter settings can still lead to good diagnostic performance. As such, robustness of radiomics features should not be overemphasized for removal of features towards assessment of clinical tasks. For differentiating NPC from CN, some radiomics features (e.g. SumEntropy, SZLGE, LGZE) outperformed conventional metrics.                   • Poor robustness did not necessarily translate into poor differentiation performance. Absolute-scale robustness of radiomics features should not be overemphasized.

10.1631/jzus.b1700260,29308604.0,,Towards precision medicine: from quantitative imaging to radiomics,"Radiology (imaging) and imaging-guided interventions, which provide multi-parametric morphologic and functional information, are playing an increasingly significant role in precision medicine. Radiologists are trained to understand the imaging phenotypes, transcribe those observations (phenotypes) to correlate with underlying diseases and to characterize the images. However, in order to understand and characterize the molecular phenotype (to obtain genomic information) of solid heterogeneous tumours, the advanced sequencing of those tissues using biopsy is required. Thus, radiologists image the tissues from various views and angles in order to have the complete image phenotypes, thereby acquiring a huge amount of data. Deriving meaningful details from all these radiological data becomes challenging and raises the big data issues. Therefore, interest in the application of radiomics has been growing in recent years as it has the potential to provide significant interpretive and predictive information for decision support. Radiomics is a combination of conventional computer-aided diagnosis, deep learning methods, and human skills, and thus can be used for quantitative characterization of tumour phenotypes. This paper discusses the overview of radiomics workflow, the results of various radiomics-based studies conducted using various radiological images such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron-emission tomography (PET), the challenges we are facing, and the potential contribution of radiomics towards precision medicine.","U.

10.1016/j.radonc.2018.03.033,,,Tracking tumor biology with radiomics: A systematic review utilizing a radiomics quality score,"Abstract    Introduction:  In this review we describe recent developments in the field of radiomics along with current relevant literature linking it to tumor biology. We furthermore explore the methodologic quality of these studies with our in-house radiomics quality scoring (RQS) tool. Finally, we offer our vision on necessary future steps for the development of stable radiomic features and their links to tumor biology.  Methods:  Two authors (S.S. and H.W.) independently performed a thorough systematic literature search and outcome extraction to identify relevant studies published in MEDLINE/PubMed (National Center for Biotechnology Information, NCBI), EMBASE (Ovid) and Web of Science (WoS). Two authors (S.S, H.W) separately and two authors (J.v.T and E.d.J) concordantly scored the articles for their methodology and analyses according to the previously published radiomics quality score (RQS).  Results:  In summary, a total of 655 records were identified till 25-09-2017 based on the previously specified search terms, from which  n =236 in MEDLINE/PubMed,  n =215 in EMBASE and  n =204 from Web of Science. After determining full article availability and reading the available articles, a total of  n =41 studies were included in the systematic review. The RQS scoring resulted in some discrepancies between the reviewers, e.g. reviewer H.W scored 4 studies ≥50%, reviewer S.S scored 3 studies ≥50% while reviewers J.v.T and E.d.J scored 1 study ≥50%. Up to nine studies were given a quality score of 0%. The majority of studies were scored below 50%.  Discussion:  In this study, we performed a systematic literature search linking radiomics to tumor biology. All but two studies ( n =39) revealed that radiomic features derived from ultrasound, CT, PET and/or MR are significantly associated with one or several specific tumor biologic substrates, from somatic mutation status to tumor histopathologic grading and metabolism. Considerable inter-observer differences were found with regard to RQS scoring, while important questions were raised concerning the interpretability of the outcome of such scores.","Sebastian Sanduleanu,Henry C.

However, the robustness of features with respect to imaging parameters is not well established. Previously identified potential imaging biomarkers were found to be intrinsically dependent on voxel size and number of gray levels (GLs) in a recent texture phantom investigation. Here, we validate the voxel size and GL in-phantom normalizations in lung tumors. Eighteen patients with non-small cell lung cancer of varying tumor volumes were analyzed. To compare with patient data, phantom scans were acquired on eight different scanners. Twenty four previously identified features were extracted from lung tumors. The Spearman rank (rs) and interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used as metrics. Eight out of 10 features showed high (rs>0.9) and low (rs 0.8) before and after GL normalizations, respectively. We conclude that voxel size and GL normalizations derived from a texture phantom study also apply to lung tumors. This study highlights the importance and utility of investigating the robustness of radiomic features with respect to CT imaging parameters in radiomic phantoms.","Muhammad Shafiq-ul-Hassan,Kujtim Latifi,Muhammad Shafiq-ul-Hassan,Geoffrey Zhang,Kujtim Latifi,Geoffrey Zhang,Ghanim Ullah,Robert J.

Die individuelle Charakterisierung einer Erkrankung auf der Grundlage von Biomarkern im weitesten Sinne ist eine grundlegende Voraussetzung hierfur. Diese Biomarker konnen bisher klinisch, histologisch oder molekular bestimmt werden. Die Entwicklung breiter Screening Methoden und gleichzeitig die Moglichkeit, grose Datenmengen („Omics“ ) mit geeigneter Software immer besser zu analysieren, fuhren dazu, dass man sich nicht nur auf einzelne Biomarker beschrankt, sondern Biomarker-Signaturen darstellen kann. Die „Radiomics” finden neben „Genomics“, „Proteomics“ oder „Metabolomics” in den letzten Jahren zunehmendes Interesse und erweitern das Biomarkerfeld. Basierend auf radiologischen Bildern werden eine Vielzahl von Merkmalen mithilfe spezifischer Algorithmen extrahiert. Diese Merkmale werden mit klinischen, (immun-) histopathologischen und genomischen Daten korreliert. Erfasste Strukturunterschiede sind Bestandteil der den Bildern zugrundeliegenden unbearbeiteten Metadaten. Diese sind fur das blose Auge oft nicht sichtbar und insofern ohne spezifische Software fur den Untersucher nicht zu erfassen. Sie lassen sich aber numerisch abbilden und grafisch visualisieren.

Dieser hat das Potenzial, Zusatzuntersuchungen oder Biopsien idealerweise durch eine „Radiomics“ Analyse zu ersetzen. Alternativ konnten „Radiomics“-Signaturen andere Biomarker suffizient erganzen und hierdurch eine prazisere, multimodale Aussage ermoglichen.

10.1101/232439,,,Shape-related characteristics of age-related differences in subcortical structures,"Abstract  OBJECTIVES  With an increasing aging population, it is important to gain a better understanding of biological markers of aging. Subcortical volume is known to differ with age; additionally considering shape-related characteristics may provide a better index of age-related differences in subcortical structure. Recently fractal dimensionality has been shown to be more sensitive to age-related differences, but this measure is borne out of mathematical principles, rather than quantifying a neurobiologically relevant characteristic directly. We considered four distinct measures of shape and how they relate to aging and fractal dimensionality: surface-to-volume ratio, sphericity, long-axis curvature, and surface texture.  METHODS  Structural MRIs from two samples, with a combined sample size of over 600 healthy adults across the adult lifespan, were used to measure age-related differences in the structure of the thalamus, putamen, caudate, and hippocampus. For each structure, volume and fractal dimensionality were calculated, as well as each of the four distinct shape measures. These measures were then examined in their utility in explaining age-related variability in brain structure.  RESULTS  The four shape measures were able to account for 80-90% of the variance in fractal dimensionality, indicating that these measures were sensitive to the same shape characteristics. Of the distinct shape measures, surface-to-volume ratio was the most sensitive aging biomarker.  CONCLUSION  Though volume is often used to characterize inter-individual differences in subcortical structures, our results demonstrate that additional measures can be useful complements to volumetry. Our results indicate that shape characteristics of subcortical structures are useful biological markers of healthy aging.","Christopher R. Madan,Christopher R. Madan",bioRxiv,2017.0

For these reasons, the potentiality of texture analysis in the context of radiotherapy has been widely investigated in several studies, especially for the prediction of the treatment response of tumour and normal tissues.

10.1038/s41598-020-64824-5,,,3D-MCN: A 3D Multi-scale Capsule Network for Lung Nodule Malignancy Prediction,"Despite the advances in automatic lung cancer malignancy prediction, achieving high accuracy remains challenging. Existing solutions are mostly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which require a large amount of training data. Most of the developed CNN models are based only on the main nodule region, without considering the surrounding tissues. Obtaining high sensitivity is challenging with lung nodule malignancy prediction. Moreover, the interpretability of the proposed techniques should be a consideration when the end goal is to utilize the model in a clinical setting. Capsule networks (CapsNets) are new and revolutionary machine learning architectures proposed to overcome shortcomings of CNNs. Capitalizing on the success of CapsNet in biomedical domains, we propose a novel model for lung tumor malignancy prediction. The proposed framework, referred to as the 3D Multi-scale Capsule Network (3D-MCN), is uniquely designed to benefit from: (i) 3D inputs, providing information about the nodule in 3D; (ii) Multi-scale input, capturing the nodule’s local features, as well as the characteristics of the surrounding tissues, and; (iii) CapsNet-based design, being capable of dealing with a small number of training samples. The proposed 3D—MCN architecture predicted lung nodule malignancy with a high accuracy of 93.12%, sensitivity of 94.94%, area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9641, and specificity of 90% when tested on the LIDC-IDRI dataset. When classifying patients as having a malignant condition (i.e., at least one malignant nodule is detected) or not, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 83%, and a sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 81% respectively.","Parnian Afshar,Parnian Afshar,Anastasia Oikonomou,Farnoosh Naderkhani,Anastasia Oikonomou,Anastasia Oikonomou,Farnoosh Naderkhani,Farnoosh Naderkhani,Farnoosh Naderkhani,Pascal N.

10.1002/mp.14388,32657426.0,,A multi-objective radiomics model for the prediction of locoregional recurrence in head and neck squamous cell cancer,"PURPOSE Locoregional recurrence (LRR) is the predominant pattern of relapse after non-surgical treatment of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancers (HNSCC). Therefore, accurately identifying patients with HNSCC who are at high risk for LRR is important for optimizing personalized treatment plans. In this work, we developed a multi-classifier, multi-objective and multi-modality (mCOM) radiomics-based outcome prediction model for HNSCC LRR. METHODS In mCOM, we considered sensitivity and specificity simultaneously as the objectives to guide the model optimization. We used multiple classifiers, comprising support vector machine (SVM), discriminant analysis (DA), and logistic regression (LR), to build the model. We used features from multiple modalities as model inputs, comprising clinical parameters and radiomics feature extracted from X-ray computed tomography (CT) images and positron emission tomography (PET) images. We proposed a multi-task multi-objective immune algorithm (mTO) to train the mCOM model and used an evidential reasoning (ER)-based method to fuse the output probabilities from different classifiers and modalities in mCOM. We evaluated the effectiveness of the developed method by using a retrospective public pre-treatment HNSCC dataset downloaded from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The input for our model included radiomic features extracted from pre-treatment PET and CT using an open source radiomics software and clinical characteristics such as sex, age, stage, primary disease site, human papillomavirus (HPV) status and treatment paradigm. In our experiment, 190 patients from two institutions were used for model training while the remaining 87 patients from the other two institutions were used for testing. RESULTS When we built the predictive model using features from single modality, the multi-classifier models achieved better performance over the models built with the three base-classifiers individually. When we built the model using features from multiple modalities, the proposed method achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.76 for the radiomics-only model, and 0.77 for the model built with radiomics and clinical features, which is significantly higher than the AUCs of models built with single-modality features. The statistical analysis was performed using MATLAB software. CONCLUSIONS Comparisons with other methods demonstrated the efficiency of the mTO algorithm and the superior performance of the proposed mCOM model for predicting HNSCC LRR.","Kai Wang,Kai Wang,Zhiguo Zhou,Zhiguo Zhou,Zhiguo Zhou,Zhiguo Zhou,Rongfang Wang,Liyuan Chen,Rongfang Wang,Liyuan Chen,Qiongwen Zhang,Qiongwen Zhang,David J.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty seven patients with oropharyngeal cancers with known HPV status (confirmed by immunohistochemistry-p16 protein testing) were retrospectively studied as follows: Group A: 95 patients (19HPV- and 76HPV+) from the MICAII grand challenge. Group B: 92 patients (52HPV- and 40HPV+) from our institution. Radiomic features (172) were extracted from pretreatment diagnostic CE-CT images of the gross tumor volume (GTV). Levene and Kolmogorov-Smirnov's tests with absolute biserial correlation (>0.48) were used to identify the discriminant features between the HPV+ and HPV- groups. The discriminant features were used to train and test eight different classifiers. Area under receiver operating characteristic (AUC), positive predictive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) were used to evaluate the performance of the classifiers. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on the discriminant feature set and seven PCs were used to train and test a generalized linear model (GLM) classifier. RESULTS: Among 172 radiomic features only 12 radiomic features (from 3 categories) were significantly different (P   0.48) between the HPV+ and HPV- groups. Among the eight classifiers trained and applied for prediction of HPV status, the GLM showed the highest performance for each discriminant feature and the combined 12 features: AUC/PPV/NPV = 0.878/0.834/0.811. The GLM high prediction power was AUC/PPV/NPV = 0.849/0.731/0.788 and AUC/PPV/NPV = 0.869/0.807/0.870 for unseen test datasets for groups A and B, respectively. After eliminating the correlation among discriminant features by applying PCA analysis, the performance of the GLM was improved by 3.3%, 2.2%, and 1.8% for AUC, PPV, and NPV, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Results imply that GTV's for HPV+ patients exhibit higher intensities, smaller lesion size, greater sphericity/roundness, and higher spatial intensity-variation/heterogeneity. Results are suggestive that radiomic features primarily associated with the spatial arrangement and morphological appearance of the tumor on contrast-enhanced diagnostic CT datasets may be potentially used for classification of HPV status.","Hassan Bagher‐Ebadian,Hassan Bagher-Ebadian,Mei Lü,Farzan Siddiqui,Mei Lu,Mei Lu,Mei Lu,Ahmed I Ghanem,Farzan Siddiqui,Ahmed I.

Automated quality assurance steps could improve the efficiency and robustness of these methods by verifying possible data biases. In particular, in head and neck (HN a challenge for image analysis tasks, including radiomics, where poor image quality can lead to systemic biases. In this work we analyze the performance of three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained to classify DA statuses. 1538 patient images were scored by a single observer as DA positive or negative. Stratified five-fold cross validation was performed to train and test CNNs using various isotropic resampling grids (64(3), 128(3) and 256(3)), with CNN depths designed to produce 32(3), 16(3), and 8(3) machine generated features. These parameters were selected to determine if more computationally efficient CNNs could be utilized to achieve the same performance. The area under the precision recall curve (PR-AUC) was used to assess CNN performance. The highest PR-AUC (0.92 +/- 0.03) was achieved with a CNN depth = 5, resampling grid = 256. The CNN performance with 256(3) resampling grid size is not significantly better than 64(3) and 128(3) after 20 epochs, which had PR-AUC = 0.89 +/- 0.03 (p -value = 0.28) and 0.91 +/- 0.02 (p -value = 0.93) at depths of 3 and 4, respectively. Our experiments demonstrate the potential to automate specific quality assurance tasks required for unbiased and robust automated pipeline and image analysis research. Additionally, we determined that there is an opportunity to simplify CNNs with smaller resampling grids to make the process more amenable to very large datasets that will be available in the future.","Mattea Welch,Chris McIntosh,Mattea Welch,Mattea L Welch,Mattea Welch,Chris McIntosh,Thomas G.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of a machine learning based prediction of etiology for acute ICHs based on quantitative radiomic image features extracted from initial noncontrast-enhanced computed tomography (NECT) brain scans. Materials and Methods: The analysis included NECT brain scans from 77 patients with acute ICH (n=50 non-neoplastic, n=27 neoplastic). Radiomic features including shape, histogram and texture markers were extracted from non- , wavelet- and log-sigma-filtered images using regions of interest of ICH and perihematomal edema (PHE). 6090 quantitative predictors were evaluated utilizing random forest algorithms with 5-fold model-external cross-validation. Model stability was assessed through comparative analysis of 10 randomly drawn cross-validation sets. Classifier performance was compared with predictions of two radiologists employing Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Results: ROC AUC of the test sets for predicting neoplastic vs. non-neoplastic ICHs was 0.89 (95% CI [0.70; 0.99]; P 80%. Compared to the radiologists’ predictions, the machine learning algorithm yielded equal or superior results for all evaluated metrics.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 251 consecutive patients with acute ICH. Two radiologists independently assessed baseline noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) images. For each radiologist, a radiological model was constructed from radiological variables; a radiomics score model was constructed from high-dimensional quantitative features extracted from NCCT images; and a combined model was constructed using both radiological variables and radiomics score. Development of models was constructed in a primary cohort (n = 177). We then validated the results in an independent validation cohort (n = 74). The primary outcome was hematoma expansion. We compared the three models for predicting hematoma expansion. Predictive performance was assessed with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: In the primary cohort, combined model and radiomics model showed greater AUCs than radiological model for both readers (all p   .05). CONCLUSIONS: NCCT-based radiomics model showed high predictive performance and outperformed radiological model in the prediction of early hematoma expansion in ICH patients. KEY POINTS: * Radiomics model showed better performance for prediction of hematoma expansion in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage than radiological feature-based model. * Hematomas which expanded in follow-up NCCT tended to be larger in baseline volume, more irregular in shape, more heterogeneous in composition, and coarser in texture. * A radiomics model provides a convenient and objective tool for prediction of hematoma expansion that helps to define subsets of patients who would benefit from anti-expansion therapy.","Huihui Xie,Shuai Ma,Huihui Xie,Xin Wang,Xiaoying Wang,Shuai Ma,Xiaoying Wang,Xiaodong Zhang,Xiaodong Zhang,Xiaodong Zhang",European Radiology,2020.0
10.23736/s1824-4785.20.03263-x,32397702.0,,Nuclear medicine radiomics in precision medicine: why we can't do without artificial intelligence.,": In recent years, radiomics, defined as the extraction of large amounts of quantitative features from medical images, has gained emerging interest. Radiomics consists of the extraction of handcrafted features combined with sophisticated statistical methods or machine learning algorithms for modelling, or deep learning algorithms that both learn features from raw data and perform modelling. These features have the potential to serve as non-invasive biomarkers for tumour characterisation, prognostic stratification and response prediction, thereby contributing to precision medicine. However, especially in nuclear medicine, variable results are obtained when using radiomics for these purposes. Individual studies show promising results, but due to small numbers of patients per study and little standardization, it is difficult to compare and validate results on other datasets. This review describes the radiomic pipeline, its applications and the increasing role of artificial intelligence within the field. Furthermore, the challenges that need to be overcome to achieve clinical translation are discussed, so that, eventually, radiomics, combined with clinical data and other biomarkers, can contribute to precision medicine, by providing the right treatment to the right patient, with the right dose, at the right time.","Wyanne A.

10.1007/s00415-020-09859-4,,,Posterior circulation stroke: machine learning-based detection of early ischemic changes in acute non-contrast CT scans,"OBJECTIVES: Triage of patients with basilar artery occlusion for additional imaging diagnostics, therapy planning, and initial outcome prediction requires assessment of early ischemic changes in early hyperacute non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) scans. However, accuracy of visual evaluation is impaired by inter- and intra-reader variability, artifacts in the posterior fossa and limited sensitivity for subtle density shifts. We propose a machine learning approach for detecting early ischemic changes in pc-ASPECTS regions (Posterior circulation Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) based on admission NCCTs. METHODS: The retrospective study includes 552 pc-ASPECTS regions (144 with infarctions in follow-up NCCTs) extracted from pre-therapeutic early hyperacute scans of 69 patients with basilar artery occlusion that later underwent successful recanalization. We evaluated 1218 quantitative image features utilizing random forest algorithms with fivefold cross-validation for the ability to detect early ischemic changes in hyperacute images that lead to definitive infarctions in follow-up imaging. Classifier performance was compared to conventional readings of two neuroradiologists. RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic area under the curves for detection of early ischemic changes were 0.70 (95% CI [0.64; 0.75]) for cerebellum to 0.82 (95% CI [0.77; 0.86]) for thalamus. Predictive performance of the classifier was significantly higher compared to visual reading for thalamus, midbrain, and pons (P value<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative features of early hyperacute NCCTs can be used to detect early ischemic changes in pc-ASPECTS regions. The classifier performance was higher or equal to results of human raters. The proposed approach could facilitate reproducible analysis in research and may allow standardized assessments for outcome prediction and therapy planning in clinical routine.","Helge Kniep,Helge Kniep,Peter Sporns,Peter B.

We explored the potential added value of baseline positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) radiomic features for prognostication and risk stratification of OPSCC beyond the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition staging scheme. Using institutional and publicly available datasets, we included OPSCC patients with known human papillomavirus (HPV) status, without baseline distant metastasis and treated with curative intent. We extracted 1037 PET and 1037 CT radiomic features quantifying lesion shape, imaging intensity, and texture patterns from primary tumors and metastatic cervical lymph nodes. Utilizing random forest algorithms, we devised novel machine-learning models for OPSCC progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) using “radiomics” features, “AJCC” variables, and the “combined” set as input. We designed both single- (PET or CT) and combined-modality (PET/CT) models. Harrell’s C-index quantified survival model performance; risk stratification was evaluated in Kaplan–Meier analysis. A total of 311 patients were included. In HPV-associated OPSCC, the best “radiomics” model achieved an average C-index ± standard deviation of 0.62 ± 0.05 (p = 0.02) for PFS prediction, compared to 0.54 ± 0.06 (p = 0.32) utilizing “AJCC” variables. Radiomics-based risk-stratification of HPV-associated OPSCC was significant for PFS and OS. Similar trends were observed in HPV-negative OPSCC. In conclusion, radiomics imaging features extracted from pre-treatment PET/CT may provide complimentary information to the current AJCC staging scheme for survival prognostication and risk-stratification of HPV-associated OPSCC.","Stefan P.

This study aimed to determine the ability of pre-treatment T2-weighted based radiomics features to predict LARC non-responders. A total of 67 LARC patients who underwent a pre-treatment MRI followed by nCRT and total mesorectal excision were assigned into training (n = 44) and validation (n = 23) groups. In both datasets, the patients were categorized according to the Ryan tumor regression grade (TRG) system into non-responders (TRG = 3) and responders (TRG 1 and 2). We extracted 960 radiomic features/patient from pre-treatment T2-weighted images. After a three-step feature selection process, including LASSO regression analysis, we built a radiomics score with seven radiomics features. This score was significantly higher among non-responders in both training and validation sets (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03) and it showed good predictive performance for LARC non-response, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.94 (95% CI: 0.82–0.99) in the training set and AUC = 0.80 (95% CI: 0.58–0.94) in the validation group. The multivariate analysis identified the radiomics score as an independent predictor for the tumor non-response (OR = 6.52, 95% CI: 1.87–22.72). Our results indicate that MRI radiomics features could be considered as potential imaging biomarkers for early prediction of LARC non-response to neoadjuvant treatment.","Bianca Petresc,Andrei Lebovici,Bianca Petresc,Cosmin Caraiani,Andrei Lebovici,Diana Feier,Cosmin Caraiani,Florin Graur,Diana Feier,Florin Graur,Mircea Buruian,Mircea Marian Buruian",Cancers,2020.0

Methods: In this retrospective study, 322 cases of histopathologically confirmed HCC lesions were included. The classifications based on preoperative grayscale ultrasound images were performed in two stages: (1) classifier #1, MVI-negative and MVI-positive cases; (2) classifier #2, MVI-positive cases were further classified as M1 or M2 cases. The gross-tumoral region (GTR) and peri-tumoral region (PTR) signatures were combined to generate gross- and peri-tumoral region (GPTR) radiomic signatures. The optimal radiomic signatures were further incorporated with vital clinical information. Multivariable logistic regression was used to build radiomic models. Results: Finally, 1,595 radiomic features were extracted from each HCC lesion. At the classifier #1 stage, the radiomic signatures based on features of GTR, PTR, and GPTR showed area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.708 (95% CI, 0.603-0.812), 0.710 (95% CI, 0.609-0.811), and 0.726 (95% CI, 0.625-0.827), respectively. Upon incorporation of vital clinical information, the AUC of the GPTR radiomic algorithm was 0.744 (95% CI, 0.646-0.841). At the classifier #2 stage, the AUC of the GTR radiomic signature was 0.806 (95% CI, 0.667-0.944). Conclusions: Our radiomic algorithm based on grayscale ultrasound images has potential value to facilitate preoperative prediction of MVI in HCC patients. The GTR radiomic signature may be helpful for further discriminating between M1 and M2 levels among MVI-positive patients.","Dong Ye,Yi Dong,Yi Dong,Zhou Liu,Liu Zhou,Liu Zhou,Wei Xia,Xingyu Zhao,Wei Xia,Wei Xia,Qi Zhang,Xingyu Zhao,Junming Jian,Qi Zhang,Qi Zhang,Rui Zhang,Xin Gao,Junming Jian,Xin Gao,Wenping Wang,Xin Gao,Wen-Ping Wang,Wen-Ping Wang",Frontiers in Oncology,2020.0
10.1016/j.lungcan.2020.05.028,32563015.0,,Radiomics as a personalized medicine tool in lung cancer: Separating the hope from the hype.,"Abstract   Radiomics has become a popular image analysis method in the last few years. Its key hypothesis is that medical images harbor biological, prognostic and predictive information that is not revealed upon visual inspection. In contrast to previous work with a priori defined imaging biomarkers, radiomics instead calculates image features at scale and uses statistical methods to identify those most strongly associated to outcome. This builds on years of research into computer aided diagnosis and pattern recognition. While the potential of radiomics to aid personalized medicine is widely recognized, several technical limitations exist which hinder biomarker translation. Aspects of the radiomic workflow lack repeatability or reproducibility under particular circumstances, which is a key requirement for the translation of imaging biomarkers into clinical practice. One of the most commonly studied uses of radiomics is for personalized medicine applications in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). In this review, we summarize reported methodological limitations in CT based radiomic analyses together with suggested solutions. We then evaluate the current NSCLC radiomics literature to assess the risk associated with accepting the published conclusions with respect to these limitations. We review different complementary scoring systems and initiatives that can be used to critically appraise data from radiomics studies. Wider awareness should improve the quality of ongoing and future radiomics studies and advance their potential as clinically relevant biomarkers for personalized medicine in patients with NSCLC.","Isabella Fornacon-Wood,Isabella Fornacon-Wood,Corinne Faivre-Finn,Isabella Fornacon-Wood,Corinne Faivre-Finn,James P.B.

Radiomics, a method for the high throughput extraction of hand-crafted features from medical images, and deep learning -the data driven modeling techniques based on the principles of simplified brain neuron interactions, are the most researched quantitative imaging techniques. Many studies reported on the potential of such techniques in the context of cDSS. Such techniques could be highly appealing due to the reuse of existing data, automation of clinical workflows, minimal invasiveness, three-dimensional volumetric characterization, and the promise of high accuracy and reproducibility of results and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, there are several challenges that quantitative imaging techniques face, and need to be addressed before the translation to clinical use. These challenges include, but are not limited to, the explainability of the models, the reproducibility of the quantitative imaging features, and their sensitivity to variations in image acquisition and reconstruction parameters. In this narrative review, we report on the status of quantitative medical image analysis using radiomics and deep learning, the challenges the field is facing, propose a framework for robust radiomics analysis, and discuss future prospects.","Abdalla Ibrahim,Abdalla Ibrahim,Sergey Primakov,Sergey Primakov,Manon Beuque,M.

Without the support of methods from the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, acomplete evaluation of the available image information is hardly feasible in clinical routine. Especially in radiotherapy planning, manual detection and segmentation of lesions is laborious, time consuming, and shows significant variability among observers. Here, AI already offers techniques to support radiation oncologists, whereby ultimately, the productivity and the quality are increased, potentially leading to an improved patient outcome. Besides detection and segmentation of lesions, AI allows the extraction of avast number of quantitative imaging features from structural or functional imaging data that are typically not accessible by means of human perception. These features can be used alone or in combination with other clinical parameters to generate mathematical models that allow, for example, prediction of the response to radiotherapy. Within the large field of AI, radiomics is the subdiscipline that deals with the extraction of quantitative image features as well as the generation of predictive or prognostic mathematical models.

Their diagnosis can be challenging as their behavior varies from benign to malignant disease. Precise and timely management of malignant pancreatic cysts might prevent transformation to pancreatic cancer. However, the current consensus guidelines, which rely on standard imaging features to predict cyst malignancy potential, are conflicting and unclear. This has led to an increased interest in radiomics, a high-throughput extraction of comprehensible data from standard of care images. Radiomics can be used as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in personalized medicine. It utilizes quantitative image analysis to extract features in conjunction with machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) methods like support vector machines, random forest, and convolutional neural network for feature selection and classification. Selected features can then serve as imaging biomarkers to predict high-risk PCLs. Radiomics studies conducted heretofore on PCLs have shown promising results. This cost-effective approach would help us to differentiate benign PCLs from malignant ones and potentially guide clinical decision-making leading to better utilization of healthcare resources. In this review, we discuss the process of radiomics, its myriad applications such as diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of therapy response. We also discuss the outcomes of studies involving radiomic analysis of PCLs and pancreatic cancer, and challenges associated with this novel field along with possible solutions. Although these studies highlight the potential benefit of radiomics in the prevention and optimal treatment of pancreatic cancer, further studies are warranted before incorporating radiomics into the clinical decision support system.","Vipin Dalal,Joseph Carmicheal,Vipin Dalal,Amaninder Dhaliwal,Joseph Carmicheal,Maneesh Jain,Amaninder Dhaliwal,Sukhwinder Kaur,Maneesh Jain,Sukhwinder Kaur,Surinder K.

The combination of radiomics data and clinical/laboratory information provides added value in many studies. Radiomics is a multi-step process that requires optimization and standardization, the development of semi-automated or automated segmentation methods, robust data quality control, and refinement of algorithms and modeling approaches for high-throughput data analysis. While radiomics remains largely in the research setting, the strong associations of predictive models and nomograms with certain pathologic, molecular, and immune markers with tumor aggressiveness and patient outcomes, provide great potential for clinical applications to inform optimized treatment strategies and patient prognosis.","Sara Lewis,Stefanie Hectors,Sara Lewis,Stefanie J.

This topic is of key importance to start collaboration between different centers and to bring radiomic studies from benchmark to bedside. A per-lesion analysis was performed on 56 metastases (mts) selected from 14 patients. A single radiologist performed the segmentation of all mts and RFs were extracted from the same segmentation, but using different software and file format. Potential sources of discrepancies were evaluated. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to describe how strongly the same radiomic measurements calculated in the two different centers resemble each other. Moreover, means of the relative differences of each RF were calculated, compared and gradually reduced. We showed that, after matching all formulas, discrepancies in RFs calculation between two centers ranged from 1% to 277%. Therefore, we evaluated other sources of variability using a stepwise approach, which led us to reduce the inter-center discrepancies to 0% for 22/25 RFs and below 2% for 3 RFs out of 25. In this study we demonstrated that different radiomic applications and masks formats might strongly impact the computation of some RFs. Therefore, when dealing with multi-center studies it is mandatory to adopt all strategies that can help in limiting the differences, thus keeping in mind the feasibility of these strategies in large cohort studies.","Arianna Defeudis,Arianna Defeudis,Cristina De Mattia,Cristina De Mattia,Francesco Rizzetto,Francesco Rizzetto,F.

10.1097/md.0000000000019114,32049826.0,,The diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence in thoracic diseases: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Thoracic diseases include a variety of common human primary malignant tumors, among which lung cancer and esophageal cancer are among the top 10 in cancer incidence and mortality. Early diagnosis is an important part of cancer treatment, so artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been developed for the accurate and automated detection and diagnosis of thoracic tumors. However, the complicated AI structure and image processing made the diagnosis result of AI-based system unstable. The purpose of this study is to systematically review published evidence to explore the accuracy of AI systems in diagnosing thoracic cancers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of AI systems for the prediction of thoracic diseases. The primary objective is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic cancers, including assessing potential biases and calculating combined estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The secondary objective is to evaluate the factors associated with different models, classifiers, and radiomics information. We will search databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase (via OVID), and the Cochrane Library. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, perform full article reviews and extract study data. We will report study characteristics and assess methodological quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. RevMan 5.3 and Meta-disc 1.4 software will be used for data synthesis. If pooling is appropriate, we will produce summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves, summary operating points (pooled sensitivity and specificity), and 95% confidence intervals around the summary operating points. Methodological subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be performed to explore heterogeneity.

10.1038/s41598-018-37197-z,30718585.0,,A PET Radiomics Model to Predict Refractory Mediastinal Hodgkin Lymphoma.,"First-order radiomic features, such as metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG), are associated with disease progression in early-stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). We hypothesized that a model incorporating first- and second-order radiomic features would more accurately predict outcome than MTV or TLG alone. We assessed whether radiomic features extracted from baseline PET scans predicted relapsed or refractory disease status in a cohort of 251 patients with stage I-II HL who were managed at a tertiary cancer center. Models were developed and tested using a machine-learning algorithm. Features extracted from mediastinal sites were highly predictive of primary refractory disease. A model incorporating 5 of the most predictive features had an area under the curve (AUC) of 95.2% and total error rate of 1.8%. By comparison, the AUC was 78% for both MTV and TLG and was 65% for maximum standardize uptake value (SUVmax). Furthermore, among the patients with refractory mediastinal disease, our model distinguished those who were successfully salvaged from those who ultimately died of HL. We conclude that our PET radiomic model may improve upfront stratification of early-stage HL patients with mediastinal disease and thus contribute to risk-adapted, individualized management.","Sarah A.

To be clinically useful, a radiomic feature must be robust to image processing steps, which has made robustness testing a necessity for many technical aspects of feature extraction. We assessed the stability of radiomic features to interpolation processing and categorised features based on stable, systematic, or unstable responses. Here, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET images for 441 oesophageal cancer patients (split: testing=353, validation=88) were resampled to 6 isotropic voxel sizes (1.5mm, 1.8mm, 2.0mm, 2.2mm, 2.5mm, 2.7mm) and 141 features were extracted from each volume of interest (VOI). Features were categorised into four groups with two statistical tests. Feature reliability was analysed using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and patient ranking consistency was assessed using a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ). We categorised 93 features robust and 6 limited robustness (stable responses), 34 potentially correctable (systematic responses), and 8 not robust (unstable responses). We developed a correction technique for features with potential systematic variation that used surface fits to link voxel size and percentage change in feature value. Twenty-nine potentially correctable features were re-categorised to robust for the validation dataset, after applying corrections defined by surface fits generated on the testing dataset. Furthermore, we found the choice of interpolation algorithm alone (spline vs trilinear) resulted in large variation in values for a number of features but the response categorisations remained constant. This study attempted to quantify the diverse response of radiomics features commonly found in 18F-FDG PET clinical modelling to isotropic voxel size interpolation.","Philip Whybra,Craig Parkinson,Philip Whybra,Kieran Foley,Craig Parkinson,John Staffurth,Kieran Foley,John Staffurth,Emiliano Spezi,Emiliano Spezi",Scientific Reports,2019.0
10.1186/s40644-019-0239-z,,,Clinical impact of variability on CT radiomics and suggestions for suitable feature selection: a focus on lung cancer,"Radiomics suffers from feature reproducibility. We studied the variability of radiomics features and the relationship of radiomics features with tumor size and shape to determine guidelines for optimal radiomics study. We dealt with 260 lung nodules (180 for training, 80 for testing) limited to 2cm or less. We quantified how voxel geometry (isotropic/anisotropic) and the number of histogram bins, factors commonly adjusted in multi-center studies, affect reproducibility. First, features showing high reproducibility between the original and isotropic transformed voxel settings were identified. Second, features showing high reproducibility in various binning settings were identified. Two hundred fifty-two features were computed and features with high intra-correlation coefficient were selected. Features that explained nodule status (benign/malignant) were retained using the least absolute shrinkage selector operator. Common features among different settings were identified, and the final features showing high reproducibility correlated with nodule status were identified. The identified features were used for the random forest classifier to validate the effectiveness of the features. The properties of the uncalculated feature were inspected to suggest a tentative guideline for radiomics studies. Nine features showing high reproducibility for both the original and isotropic voxel settings were selected and used to classify nodule status (AUC 0.659–0.697). Five features showing high reproducibility among different binning settings were selected and used in classification (AUC 0.729–0.748). Some texture features are likely to be successfully computed if a nodule was larger than 1000mm3. Features showing high reproducibility among different settings correlated with nodule status were identified.","Seung-Hak Lee,H.

This prospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and signed informed consent was obtained from all participants. From December 2015 to April 2017, 37 patients with lacrimal gland lesions underwent MRI before surgery, including axial T1-WI, axial Diffusion-WI, coronal DIXON-T2-WI and coronal post-contrast DIXON-T1-WI. Two readers manually delineated both lacrimal glands to assess inter-observer reproducibility, and one reader performed two successive delineations to assess intra-observer reproducibility. Radiomics features were extracted using an in-house software to calculate 85 features per region-of-interest (510 features/patient). Reproducible features were defined as features presenting both an intra-class correlation coefficient ≥0.8 and a concordance correlation coefficient ≥0.9 across combinations of the three delineations. Among these features, the ones yielding redundant information were identified as clusters using hierarchical clustering based on the Spearman correlation coefficient. All the MR sequences provided reproducible radiomics features (range 14(16%)−37(44%)) and non-redundant clusters (range 5–14). The highest numbers of features and clusters were provided by the water and in-phase DIXON T2-WI and water and in-phase post-contrast DIXON T1-WI (37, 26, 26 and 26 features and 14,12, 9 and 11 clusters, respectively). A total of 145 reproducible features grouped into 51 independent clusters was provided by pooling all the MR sequences. All MRI sequences provided reproducible radiomics features yielding independent information which could potentially serve as biomarkers.","Augustin Lecler,Loïc Duron,Augustin Lecler,D.

10.1088/1361-6560/ab2f44,31272093.0,,Impact of image preprocessing on the scanner dependence of multi-parametric MRI radiomic features and covariate shift in multi-institutional glioblastoma datasets.,"Recent advances in radiomics have enhanced the value of medical imaging in various aspects of clinical practice, but a crucial component that remains to be investigated further is the robustness of quantitative features to imaging variations and across multiple institutions. In the case of MRI, signal intensity values vary according to the acquisition parameters used, yet no consensus exists on which preprocessing techniques are favorable in reducing scanner-dependent variability of image-based features. Hence, the purpose of this study was to assess the impact of common image preprocessing methods on the scanner dependence of MRI radiomic features in multi-institutional glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) datasets. Two independent GBM cohorts were analyzed: 50 cases from the TCGA-GBM dataset and 111 cases acquired in our institution, and each case consisted of 3 MRI sequences viz. FLAIR, T1-weighted, and T1-weighted post-contrast. Five image preprocessing techniques were examined: 8-bit global rescaling, 8-bit local rescaling, bias field correction, histogram standardization, and isotropic resampling. A total of 420 features divided into eight categories representing texture, shape, edge, and intensity histogram were extracted. Two distinct imaging parameters were considered: scanner manufacturer and scanner magnetic field strength. Wilcoxon tests identified features robust to the considered acquisition parameters under the selected image preprocessing techniques. A machine learning-based strategy was implemented to measure the covariate shift between the analyzed datasets using features computed using the aforementioned preprocessing methods. Finally, radiomic scores (rad-scores) were constructed by identifying features relevant to patients' overall survival after eliminating those impacted by scanner variability. These were then evaluated for their prognostic significance through Kaplan-Meier and Cox hazards regression analyses. Our results demonstrate that overall, histogram standardization contributes the most in reducing radiomic feature variability as it is the technique to reduce the covariate shift for three feature categories and successfully discriminate patients into groups of different survival risks.","Hyemin Um,Florent Tixier,Hyemin Um,Florent Tixier,Dalton Bermudez,Florent Tixier,Joseph O.

10.3389/fonc.2019.01393,31921650.0,,Machine Learning and Feature Selection Methods for Disease Classification With Application to Lung Cancer Screening Image Data.,"As awareness of the habits and risks associated with lung cancer has increased, so has the interest in promoting and improving upon lung cancer screening procedures. Recent research demonstrates the benefits of lung cancer screening; the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) found as its primary result that preventative screening significantly decreases the death rate for patients battling lung cancer. However, it was also noted that the false positive rate was very high (> 94%). In this work, we investigated the ability of various machine learning classifiers to accurately predict lung cancer nodule status while also considering the associated false positive rate. We utilized 416 quantitative imaging biomarkers taken from CT scans of lung nodules from 200 patients, where the nodules had been verified as cancerous or benign. These imaging biomarkers were created from both nodule and parenchymal tissue. A variety of linear, nonlinear, and ensemble predictive classifying models, along with several feature selection methods, were used to classify the binary outcome of malignant or benign status. Elastic net and support vector machine classifiers (combined with either a linear combination or correlation feature selection method) performed the best (average cross-validation AUC near 0.72 for these models), while random forest and bagged trees were the worst performing classifiers (AUC near 0.60). For the best performing models, the false positive rate was near 30%, notably lower than that reported in the NLST. The use of radiomic biomarkers with machine learning methods are a promising diagnostic tool for tumor classification. The have the potential to provide good classification and simultaneously reduce the false positive rate.","Darcie A. P. Delzell,Sara Magnuson,Darcie A. P.

METHODS: Forty-two patients who were diagnosed as having HL and underwent pretreatment F-FDG PET scans were retrospectively enrolled. For each patient, we extracted 450 radiomic features from PET images. The prognostic significance of the clinical and radiomic features was assessed in relation to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Receiver operating characteristic curve, Cox proportional hazards regression, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to examine the potential independent predictors and to evaluate the predictive value. RESULTS: Intensity nonuniformity extracted from a gray-level run-length matrix and the Ann Arbor stage were independently associated with PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 22.8, P < 0.001; HR = 7.6, P = 0.024) and OS (HR = 14.5, P = 0.012; HR = 8.5, P = 0.048), respectively. In addition, SUV kurtosis was an independent prognosticator for PFS (HR = 6.6, P = 0.026). We devised a prognostic scoring system based on these 3 risk predictors. The proposed scoring system further improved the risk stratification of the current staging classification (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The radiomic feature intensity nonuniformity is an independent prognostic predictor of PFS and OS in patients with HL. We devised a prognostic scoring system, which may be more beneficial for patient risk stratification in guiding therapy compared with the current Ann Arbor staging system.","Kun‐Han Lue,Yifeng Wu,Kun-Han Lue,Yi-Feng Wu,Yi-Feng Wu,Yi Feng Wu,Shu‐Hsin Liu,Tsung-Cheng Hsieh,Shu-Hsin Liu,Shu-Hsin Liu,Tsung-Cheng Hsieh,Keh‐Shih Chuang,Tsung-Cheng Hsieh,Keh-Shih Chuang,Hsueh-Yi Lin,Yu-Hung Chen,Hsin-Hon Lin,Yu-Hung Chen",Clinical Nuclear Medicine,2019.0

10.1002/mrm.27758,,,Task-based assessment of a convolutional neural network for segmenting breast lesions for radiomic analysis.,"PURPOSE: Radiomics allows for powerful data-mining and feature extraction techniques to guide clinical decision making. Image segmentation is a necessary step in such pipelines and different techniques can significantly affect results. We demonstrate that a convolutional neural network (CNN) segmentation method performs comparably to expert manual segmentations in an established radiomics pipeline. METHODS: Using the manual regions of interest (ROIs) of an expert radiologist (R1), a CNN was trained to segment breast lesions from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). Following network training, we segmented lesions for the testing set of a previously established radiomics pipeline for predicting lymph node metastases using DCE-MRI of breast cancer. Prediction accuracy of CNN segmentations relative to manual segmentations by R1 from the original study, a resident (R2), and another expert radiologist (R3) were determined. We then retrained the CNN and radiomics model using R3's manual segmentations to determine the effects of different expert observers on end-to-end prediction. RESULTS: Using R1's ROIs, the CNN achieved a mean Dice coefficient of 0.71 ± 0.16 in the testing set. When input to our previously published radiomics pipeline, these CNN segmentations achieved comparable prediction performance to R1's manual ROIs, and superior performance to those of the other radiologists. Similar results were seen when training the CNN and radiomics model using R3's ROIs. CONCLUSION: A CNN architecture is able to provide DCE-MRI breast lesion segmentations which are suitable for input to our radiomics model. Moreover, the previously established radiomics model and CNN can be accurately trained end-to-end using ground truth data provided by distinct experts.","Karl Spuhler,Jie Ding,Karl Spuhler,Jie Ding,Chunling Liu,Chunling Liu,Chunling Liu,Jinhua Sun,Mario Serrano‐Sosa,Junqi Sun,Meghan Moriarty,Mario Serrano-Sosa,Chuan Huang,Meghan Moriarty,Chuan Huang",Magnetic Resonance in Medicine,2019.0

To achieve global parity in interpretation, semi-quantitative scoring systems have been developed based on observer assessments; these are widely used in scoring coronary artery disease, the arthritides and neurological conditions and for indicating the likelihood of malignancy. However, in an era of machine learning and artificial intelligence, it is increasingly desirable that we extract quantitative biomarkers from medical images that inform on disease detection, characterisation, monitoring and assessment of response to treatment. Quantitation has the potential to provide objective decision-support tools in the management pathway of patients. Despite this, the quantitative potential of imaging remains under-exploited because of variability of the measurement, lack of harmonised systems for data acquisition and analysis, and crucially, a paucity of evidence on how such quantitation potentially affects clinical decision-making and patient outcome. This article reviews the current evidence for the use of semi-quantitative and quantitative biomarkers in clinical settings at various stages of the disease pathway including diagnosis, staging and prognosis, as well as predicting and detecting treatment response.

After the definition of texture parameters (shape features; first-, second-, and higher-order features), we briefly discuss the origin of the term radiomics and the methods for selecting the parameters useful for a radiomic approach, including cluster analysis, principal component analysis, random forest, neural network, linear/logistic regression, and other. Reproducibility and clinical value of parameters should be firstly tested with internal cross-validation and then validated on independent external cohorts. This article summarises the major issues regarding this multi-step process, focussing in particular on challenges of the extraction of radiomic features from data sets provided by computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.","Stefania Rizzo,Stefania Rizzo,Francesca Botta,Francesca Botta,Sara Raimondi,Sara Raimondi,Daniela Origgi,Cristiana Fanciullo,Daniela Origgi,Cristiana Fanciullo,Alessio Giuseppe Morganti,Alessio G.

10.1007/s11227-020-03565-8,,,A CUDA-powered method for the feature extraction and unsupervised analysis of medical images,"Image texture extraction and analysis are fundamental steps in computer vision. In particular, considering the biomedical field, quantitative imaging methods are increasingly gaining importance because they convey scientifically and clinically relevant information for prediction, prognosis, and treatment response assessment. In this context, radiomic approaches are fostering large-scale studies that can have a significant impact in the clinical practice. In this work, we present a novel method, called CHASM (Cuda, HAralick & SoM), which is accelerated on the graphics processing unit (GPU) for quantitative imaging analyses based on Haralick features and on the self-organizing map (SOM). The Haralick features extraction step relies upon the gray-level co-occurrence matrix, which is computationally burdensome on medical images characterized by a high bit depth. The downstream analyses exploit the SOM with the goal of identifying the underlying clusters of pixels in an unsupervised manner. CHASM is conceived to leverage the parallel computation capabilities of modern GPUs. Analyzing ovarian cancer computed tomography images, CHASM achieved up to                                                           $$\sim 19.5\times $$and                                                           $$\sim 37\times $$speed-up factors for the Haralick feature extraction and for the SOM execution, respectively, compared to the corresponding C++ coded sequential versions.

Although reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of viral nucleic acid is the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, its sensitivity was found to not be high enough in many reports. As radiomics-based diagnosis research has recently emerged, we aimed to use computerized tomography (CT)-based radiomics models to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other viral pneumonia infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was performed according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis diagnostic test accuracy studies (PRISMA-DTA) guidelines. The Pubmed, Cochrane, and Embase databases were searched. The pooled sensitivity and pooled specificity were calculated. A summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curve was constructed. The study quality was evaluated based on the radiomics quality score. RESULTS A total of 10,300 patients were involved in this meta-analysis. The radiomics quality score ranged from 13 to 16 (maximum score: 36). The pooled sensitivity was 0.885 (95% CI: 0.818-0.929), and the pooled specificity was 0.811 (95% CI: 0.667-0.902). The pooled AUC was 906. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis showed that CT-based radiomics feature models can successfully differentiate COVID-19 from other viral pneumonias.","Yung‐Shuo Kao,Yung-Shuo Kao,Kun-Te Lin,Yung-Shuo Kao,Kun-Te Lin",,2021.0
10.1186/s40644-021-00407-5,34039403.0,,Application of contrast-enhanced CT radiomics in prediction of early recurrence of locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma after trimodal therapy.,"Background  Early recurrence of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is defined as recurrence after surgery within 1 year, and appears as local recurrence, distant recurrence, and lymph node positive and disseminated recurrence. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is recommended for diagnosis of primary tumor and initial staging of oesophageal SCC, but it cannot be used to predict early recurrence. It is reported that radiomics can help predict preoperative stages of oesophageal SCC, lymph node metastasis before operation, and 3-year overall survival of oesophageal SCC patients following chemoradiotherapy by extracting high-throughput quantitative features from CT images. This study aimed to develop models based on CT radiomics and clinical features of oesophageal SCC to predict early recurrence of locally advanced cancer.  Methods  We collected electronic medical records and image data of 197 patients with confirmed locally advanced oesophageal SCC. These patients were randomly allocated to 137 patients in the training cohort and 60 in the test cohort. 352 radiomics features were extracted by delineating region-of-interest (ROI) around the lesion on CECT images and clinical signature was generated by medical records. The radiomics model, clinical model, the combined model of radiomics and clinical features were developed by radiomics features and/or clinical characteristics. Predicting performance of the three models was assessed with area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy and F-1 score.  Results  Eleven radiomics features and/or six clinical signatures were selected to build prediction models related to recurrence of locally advanced oesophageal SCC after trimodal therapy. The AUC of integration of radiomics and clinical models was better than that of radiomics or clinical model for the training cohort (0.821 versus 0.754 or 0.679, respectively) and for the validation cohort (0.809 versus 0.646 or 0.658, respectively). Integrated model of radiomics and clinical features showed good performance in predicting early recurrence of locally advanced oesophageal SCC for both the training and validation cohorts (accuracy = 0.730 and 0.733, and F-1score = 0.730 and 0.778, respectively).  Conclusions  The integrated model of CECT radiomics and clinical features may be a potential imaging biomarker to predict early recurrence of locally advanced oesophageal SCC after trimodal therapy.","Shengjun Tang,Jing Ou,Sun Tang,Jun Liu,Jing Ou,Jun Liu,Yu Wu,Changqiang Wu,Yu-ping Wu,Changqiang Wu,Tianwu Chen,Tian-wu Chen,Xiaoming Zhang,Xiao-Ming Zhang,Rui Li,Rui Li,Mengjie Tang,Yang Long,Meng-jie Tang,Bang-guo Tan,Li-qin Yang,Fulin Lu,Bang-guo Tan,Jiani Hu,Fu-Lin Lu,Jiani Hu",Cancer Imaging,2021.0

However, radiomic features are susceptible to image acquisition and segmentation variability. Ideally, only features robust to these variations would be incorporated into predictive models, for good generalisability. We extracted 93 radiomic features from carotid artery computed tomography angiograms of 41 patients with cerebrovascular events. We tested feature robustness to region-of-interest perturbations, image pre-processing settings and quantisation methods using both single- and multi-slice approaches. We assessed the ability of the most robust features to identify culprit and non-culprit arteries using several machine learning algorithms and report the average area under the curve (AUC) from five-fold cross validation. Multi-slice features were superior to single for producing robust radiomic features (67 vs. 61). The optimal image quantisation method used bin widths of 25 or 30. Incorporating our top 10 non-redundant robust radiomics features into ElasticNet achieved an AUC of 0.73 and accuracy of 69% (compared to carotid calcification alone [AUC: 0.44, accuracy: 46%]). Our results provide key information for introducing carotid CT radiomics into clinical practice. If validated prospectively, our robust carotid radiomic set could improve stroke prediction and target therapies to those at highest risk.","Elizabeth Le,Elizabeth P.V. Le,Elizabeth P.V.

Five spectral parameters, 20 texture, and 80 texture-derivative features were extracted from the index lymph node before treatment. Response was assessed initially at 3months with complete responders labelled as early responders (ER). Patients with residual disease were followed to classify them as either late responders (LR) or patients with persistent/progressive disease (PD). Machine learning classifiers with leave-one-out cross-validation was used for the development of a binary response-prediction radiomics model. A total of 59 patients were included in the study (22 ER, 29 LR, and 8 PD). A support vector machine (SVM) classifier led to the best performance with accuracy and area under curve (AUC) of 92% and 0.91, responsively to define the response at 3months (ER vs. LR/PD). The 2-year recurrence-free survival for predicted-ER, LR, PD using an SVM-model was 91%, 78%, and 27%, respectively (p<0.01). Pretreatment QUS-radiomics using texture derivatives in HNSCC can predict the response to RT with an accuracy of more than 90% with a strong influence on the survival.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-five patients who received first-line rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy for DLBCL were included in the study. Radiomics features and standard uptake value (SUV)-based measurements were extracted from baseline PET images for a total of 147 lesions. The selection of the most relevant features was made using the recursive feature elimination algorithm. A machine-learning model was trained using the logistic regression classifier with cross-validation to predict treatment response. The independent predictors of incomplete response were evaluated with multivariable regression analysis. RESULTS A total of 14 textural features were selected by the recursive elimination algorithm, achieving a feature-to-lesion ratio of 1:10. The accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model for predicting incomplete response were 0.87 and 0.81, respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that SUVmax and gray level co-occurrence matrix dissimilarity were independent predictors of lesions with incomplete response to first-line R-CHOP chemotherapy. CONCLUSION Increased textural heterogeneity in baseline PET images was found to be associated with incomplete response in DLBCL.","Nazım Coşkun,Nazim Coskun,Berna Okudan,Berna Okudan,Doğan Uncu,Dogan Uncu,Dogan Uncu,Mehmet Kitapçı,Mehmet Tevfik Kitapci",Nuclear Medicine Communications,2021.0

10.21037/qims-20-218,,,"Considerable effects of imaging sequences, feature extraction, feature selection, and classifiers on radiomics-based prediction of microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma using magnetic resonance imaging","Background Microvascular invasion (MVI) has a significant effect on the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its preoperative identification is challenging. Radiomics features extracted from medical images, such as magnetic resonance (MR) images, can be used to predict MVI. In this study, we explored the effects of different imaging sequences, feature extraction and selection methods, and classifiers on the performance of HCC MVI predictive models. Methods After screening against the inclusion criteria, 69 patients with HCC and preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR images were enrolled. In total, 167 features were extracted from the MR images of each sequence for each patient. Experiments were designed to investigate the effects of imaging sequence, number of gray levels (Ng), quantization algorithm, feature selection method, and classifiers on the performance of radiomics biomarkers in the prediction of HCC MVI. We trained and tested these models using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Results The radiomics model based on the images of the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) had better predictive performance than those based on the arterial phase (AP), portal venous phase (PVP), and pre-enhanced T1-weighted images [area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) =0.792 vs. 0.641/0.634/0.620, P=0.041/0.021/0.010, respectively]. Compared with the equal-probability and Lloyd-Max algorithms, the radiomics features obtained using the Uniform quantization algorithm had a better performance (AUC =0.643/0.666 vs. 0.792, P=0.002/0.003, respectively). Among the values of 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128, the best predictive performance was achieved when the Ng was 64 (AUC =0.792 vs. 0.584/0.697/0.677/0.734, P<0.001/P=0.039/0.001/0.137, respectively). We used a two-stage feature selection method which combined the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and recursive feature elimination (RFE) gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), which achieved better stability than and outperformed LASSO, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), and support vector machine (SVM)-RFE (stability =0.967 vs. 0.837/0.623/0.390, respectively; AUC =0.850 vs. 0.792/0.713/0.699, P=0.142/0.007/0.003, respectively). The model based on the radiomics features of HBP images using the GBDT classifier showed a better performance for the preoperative prediction of MVI compared with logistic regression (LR), SVM, and random forest (RF) classifiers (AUC =0.895 vs. 0.850/0.834/0.884, P=0.558/0.229/0.058, respectively). With the optimal combination of these factors, we established the best model, which had an AUC of 0.895, accuracy of 87.0%, specificity of 82.5%, and sensitivity of 93.1%.

Patients and Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 334 patients with surgically resected and pathologically confirmed ESCC, including 96 patients with LVI and 238 patients without LVI. All enrolled patients were randomly divided into a training cohort and a testing cohort at a ratio of 7:3, with the training cohort containing 234 patients (68 patients with LVI and 166 without LVI) and the testing cohort containing 100 patients (28 patients with LVI and 72 without LVI). All patients underwent preoperative CECT scans within two weeks before operation. Quantitative radiomics features were extracted from CECT images, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was applied to select radiomics features. Logistic regression , support vector machine , and decision treemethods were separately used to establish radiomics models to predict the LVI status in ESCC, and the best model was selected to calculate Radscore, which combined with two clinical CT predictors to build a combined model. The clinical model was also developed by using logistic regression. The receiver characteristic curve (ROC) and decision curve (DCA) analysis were used to evaluate the model performance in predicting the LVI . Results: In radiomics model, Sphericity and Gray-level non-uniformity (GLNU) were the most significant radiomics features for predicting LVI. In clinical model, the maximum tumor thickness based on CECT (cThick) in patients with LVI was significantly greater than that without LVI (P<0.001). Patients with LVI had a higher clinical N stage based on CECT (cN stage) than patients without LVI (P<0.001). The ROC analysis showed that both the radiomics model (AUC values of 0.847 and 0.826 in the training and testing cohort, respectively) and the combined model (0.876 and 0.867) performed better than the clinical model (0.775 and 0.798 respectively), with the combined model exhibiting the best performance. Conclusions: The combined model incorporating radiomics features and clinical CT predictors may potentially predict the LVI status in ESCC and provide support for clinical treatment decisions.","Li Yang,Meng Yu,Yang Li,Guangda Wang,Meng Yu,Guangda Wang,Li Yang,Chongfei Ma,Ming-Bo Wang,Chongfei Ma,Meng Yue,Mingbo Wang,Mengdi Cong,Meng Yue,Mengdi Cong,Jialiang Ren,Guo‐Ming Shi,Jialiang Ren,Jialiang Ren,Gaofeng Shi",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0
10.1007/s00330-021-07721-3,,,Correction to: Incorporating radiomics into clinical trials: expert consensus endorsed by the European Society of Radiology on considerations for data-driven compared to biologically driven quantitative biomarkers.,"Existing quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIBs) are associated with known biological tissue characteristics and follow a well-understood path of technical, biological and clinical validation before incorporation into clinical trials. In radiomics, novel data-driven processes extract numerous visually imperceptible statistical features from the imaging data with no a priori assumptions on their correlation with biological processes. The selection of relevant features (radiomic signature) and incorporation into clinical trials therefore requires additional considerations to ensure meaningful imaging endpoints. Also, the number of radiomic features tested means that power calculations would result in sample sizes impossible to achieve within clinical trials. This article examines how the process of standardising and validating data-driven imaging biomarkers differs from those based on biological associations. Radiomic signatures are best developed initially on datasets that represent diversity of acquisition protocols as well as diversity of disease and of normal findings, rather than within clinical trials with standardised and optimised protocols as this would risk the selection of radiomic features being linked to the imaging process rather than the pathology. Normalisation through discretisation and feature harmonisation are essential pre-processing steps. Biological correlation may be performed after the technical and clinical validity of a radiomic signature is established, but is not mandatory. Feature selection may be part of discovery within a radiomics-specific trial or represent exploratory endpoints within an established trial; a previously validated radiomic signature may even be used as a primary/secondary endpoint, particularly if associations are demonstrated with specific biological processes and pathways being targeted within clinical trials. KEY POINTS: • Data-driven processes like radiomics risk false discoveries due to high-dimensionality of the dataset compared to sample size, making adequate diversity of the data, cross-validation and external validation essential to mitigate the risks of spurious associations and overfitting. • Use of radiomic signatures within clinical trials requires multistep standardisation of image acquisition, image analysis and data mining processes. • Biological correlation may be established after clinical validation but is not mandatory.","Laure Fournier,Laure Fournier,Lena Costaridou,Lena Costaridou,Lena Costaridou,Luc Bidaut,Luc Bidaut,Luc Bidaut,Nicolas Michoux,Nicolas Michoux,Nicolas Michoux,Frédéric Lecouvet,Frédéric Lecouvet,F.

10.1016/j.radonc.2021.05.002,33984349.0,,Deciphering the glioblastoma phenotype by computed tomography radiomics,"Abstract   Introduction  Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumour which has, despite extensive treatment, a median overall survival of 15 months. Radiomics is the high-throughput extraction of large amounts of image features from radiographic images, which allows capturing the tumour phenotype in 3D and in a non-invasive way. In this study we assess the prognostic value of CT radiomics for overall survival in patients with a GBM.    Materials and methods  Clinical data and pre-treatment CT images were obtained from 218 patients diagnosed with a GBM via biopsy who underwent radiotherapy +/- temozolomide between 2004 and 2015 treated at three independent institutes (n=93, 62 and 63). A clinical prognostic score (CPS), a simple radiomics model consisting of volume based score (VPS), a complex radiomics prognostic score (RPS) and a combined clinical and radiomics (C+R)PS model were developed. The population was divided into three risk groups for each prognostic score and respective Kaplan-Meier curves were generated.    Results  Patient characteristics were broadly comparable. Clinically significant differences were observed with regards to radiation dose, tumour volume and performance status between datasets. Image acquisition parameters differed between institutes. The cross-validated c-indices were moderately discriminative and for the CPS ranged from 0.63-0.65; the VPS c-indices ranged between 0.52-0.61; the RPS c-indices ranged from 0.57-0.64 and the combined clinical and radiomics model resulted in c-indices of 0.59–0.71.    Conclusion  In this study clinical and CT radiomics features were used to predict OS in GBM. Discrimination between low-, middle- and high-risk patients based on the combined clinical and radiomics model was comparable to previous MRI-based models.","Inge Compter,Maikel Verduin,Inge Compter,Zhenwei Shi,M.

This retrospective multicenter cohort study analyzed 520 non-enhanced CT scans and clinical data of patients with acute spontaneous ICH. Clinical outcome at hospital discharge was dichotomized into good outcome and poor outcome using different modified Rankin Scale (mRS) cut-off values. Predictive performance of a random forest machine learning approach based on filter- and texture-derived high-end image features was evaluated for differentiation of functional outcome at mRS 2, 3, and 4. Prediction of survival (mRS ≤ 5) was compared to results of the ICH Score. All models were tuned, validated, and tested in a nested 5-fold cross-validation approach. Receiver-operating-characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) of the machine learning classifier using image features only was 0.80 (95% CI [0.77; 0.82]) for predicting mRS ≤ 2, 0.80 (95% CI [0.78; 0.81]) for mRS ≤ 3, and 0.79 (95% CI [0.77; 0.80]) for mRS ≤ 4. Trained on survival prediction (mRS ≤ 5), the classifier reached an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI [0.78; 0.82]) which was equivalent to results of the ICH Score. If combined, the integrated model showed a significantly higher AUC of 0.84 (95% CI [0.83; 0.86], P value <0.05). Accordingly, sensitivities were significantly higher at Youden Index maximum cut-offs (77% vs. 74% sensitivity at 76% specificity, P value <0.05).

10.3389/fonc.2021.629321,,,Improving the Prediction of Benign or Malignant Breast Masses Using a Combination of Image Biomarkers and Clinical Parameters.,"Background: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death in female cancer patients. The disease can be detected early using Mammography, an effective X-ray imaging technology. The most important step in mammography is the classification of mammogram patches as benign or malignant. Classically, benign or malignant breast tumors are diagnosed by radiologists' interpretation of mammograms based on clinical parameters. However, because masses are heterogeneous, clinical parameters supply limited information on mammography mass. Therefore, this study aimed to predict benign or malignant breast masses using a combination of image biomarkers and clinical parameters. Methods: We trained a deep learning (DL) fusion network of VGG16 and Inception-V3 network in 5,996 mammography images from the training cohort; DL features were extracted from the second fully connected layer of the DL fusion network. We then developed a combined model incorporating DL features, hand-crafted features, and clinical parameters to predict benign or malignant breast masses. The prediction performance was compared between clinical parameters and the combination of the above features. The strengths of the clinical model and the combined model were subsequently validated in a test cohort (n = 244) and an external validation cohort (n = 100), respectively. Results: Extracted features comprised 30 hand-crafted features, 27 DL features, and 5 clinical features (shape, margin type, breast composition, age, mass size). The model combining the three feature types yielded the best performance in predicting benign or malignant masses (AUC = 0.961) in the test cohort. A significant difference in the predictive performance between the combined model and the clinical model was observed in an independent external validation cohort (AUC: 0.973 vs. 0.911, p = 0.019). Conclusion: The prediction of benign or malignant breast masses improves when image biomarkers and clinical parameters are combined; the combined model was more robust than clinical parameters alone.","Yanhua Cui,Yanhua Cui,Yun Li,Xin Dong,Yun Li,Tong Bai,Dong Xing,Jiwen Dong,Tong Bai,Jian Zhu,Jiwen Dong,Jiwen Dong,Jian Zhu,Jian Zhu",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0
10.1007/s00330-020-07598-8,33492473.0,,Incorporating radiomics into clinical trials: expert consensus on considerations for data-driven compared to biologically driven quantitative biomarkers.,"Existing quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIBs) are associated with known biological tissue characteristics and follow a well-understood path of technical, biological and clinical validation before incorporation into clinical trials. In radiomics, novel data-driven processes extract numerous visually imperceptible statistical features from the imaging data with no a priori assumptions on their correlation with biological processes. The selection of relevant features (radiomic signature) and incorporation into clinical trials therefore requires additional considerations to ensure meaningful imaging endpoints. Also, the number of radiomic features tested means that power calculations would result in sample sizes impossible to achieve within clinical trials. This article examines how the process of standardising and validating data-driven imaging biomarkers differs from those based on biological associations. Radiomic signatures are best developed initially on datasets that represent diversity of acquisition protocols as well as diversity of disease and of normal findings, rather than within clinical trials with standardised and optimised protocols as this would risk the selection of radiomic features being linked to the imaging process rather than the pathology. Normalisation through discretisation and feature harmonisation are essential pre-processing steps. Biological correlation may be performed after the technical and clinical validity of a radiomic signature is established, but is not mandatory. Feature selection may be part of discovery within a radiomics-specific trial or represent exploratory endpoints within an established trial; a previously validated radiomic signature may even be used as a primary/secondary endpoint, particularly if associations are demonstrated with specific biological processes and pathways being targeted within clinical trials. KEY POINTS: • Data-driven processes like radiomics risk false discoveries due to high-dimensionality of the dataset compared to sample size, making adequate diversity of the data, cross-validation and external validation essential to mitigate the risks of spurious associations and overfitting. • Use of radiomic signatures within clinical trials requires multistep standardisation of image acquisition, image analysis and data mining processes. • Biological correlation may be established after clinical validation but is not mandatory.","Laure Fournier,Lena Costaridou,Laure Fournier,Luc Bidaut,Lena Costaridou,Luc Bidaut,Nicolas Michoux,Nicolas Michoux,Frédéric Lecouvet,Lioe‐Fee de Geus‐Oei,Frédéric Lecouvet,Ronald Boellaard,L-F de Geus-Oei,Lioe-Fee de Geus-Oei,Daniela E.

10.3390/cancers13102431,,,Iodine Map Radiomics in Breast Cancer: Prediction of Metastatic Status.,"Dual-energy CT (DECT) iodine maps enable quantification of iodine concentrations as a marker for tissue vascularization. We investigated whether iodine map radiomic features derived from staging DECT enable prediction of breast cancer metastatic status, and whether textural differences exist between primary breast cancers and metastases. Seventy-seven treatment-naive patients with biopsy-proven breast cancers were included retrospectively (41 non-metastatic, 36 metastatic). Radiomic features including first-, second-, and higher-order metrics as well as shape descriptors were extracted from volumes of interest on iodine maps. Following principal component analysis, a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-NN) was used for classification (70% of cases for training, 30% validation). Histopathology served as reference standard. MLP-NN predicted metastatic status with AUCs of up to 0.94, and accuracies of up to 92.6 in the training and 82.6 in the validation datasets. The separation of primary tumor and metastatic tissue yielded AUCs of up to 0.87, with accuracies of up to 82.8 in the training, and 85.7 in the validation dataset. DECT iodine map-based radiomic signatures may therefore predict metastatic status in breast cancer patients. In addition, microstructural differences between primary and metastatic breast cancer tissue may be reflected by differences in DECT radiomic features.","Lukas Lenga,Simon Bernatz,Lukas Lenga,Simon Bernatz,Simon S.

METHODS We retrospectively enrolled 124 patients with pathologically proven RB (90 in training set and 34 in validation set) who had MRI scans before surgery. A radiomics model for predicting PLONI was developed by extracting quantitative imaging features from axial T2W images and contrast-enhanced T1W images in the training set. The Kruskal-Wallis test, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, and recursive feature elimination were used for feature selection, where upon a radiomics model was built with a logistic regression (LR) classifier. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the accuracy were assessed to evaluate the predictive performance in the training and validation set. The performance of the radiomics model was compared to radiologists' assessment by DeLong test. RESULTS The AUC of the radiomics model for the prediction of PLONI was 0.928 in the training set and 0.841 in the validation set. Radiomics model produced better sensitivity than radiologists' assessment (81.1% vs 43.2% in training set, 82.4vs52.9% in validation set). In all 124 patients, the AUC of the radiomics model was 0.897, while that of radiologists' assessment was 0.674 (p < 0.001, DeLong test). CONCLUSION MRI-based radiomics model to predict PLONI in RB patients was shown to be superior to visual assessment with improved sensitivity and AUC, and may serve as a potential tool to guide personalized treatment.","Zhenzhen Li,Li Z,Jun Guo,Guo J,Jian Guo,Xiaolin Xu,Xu X,Wenbin Wei,Xiaolin Xu,Junfang Xian,Wenbin Wei,Wei W,Xian J,Junfang Xian",,2021.0
10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104304,33691201.0,,Machine learning-based prognostic modeling using clinical data and quantitative radiomic features from chest CT images in COVID-19 patients.,"OBJECTIVE To develop prognostic models for survival (alive or deceased status) prediction of COVID-19 patients using clinical data (demographics and history, laboratory tests, visual scoring by radiologists) and lung/lesion radiomic features extracted from chest CT images. METHODS Overall, 152 patients were enrolled in this study protocol. These were divided into 106 training/validation and 46 test datasets (untouched during training), respectively. Radiomic features were extracted from the segmented lungs and infectious lesions separately from chest CT images. Clinical data, including patients' history and demographics, laboratory tests and radiological scores were also collected. Univariate analysis was first performed (q-value reported after false discovery rate (FDR) correction) to determine the most predictive features among all imaging and clinical data. Prognostic modeling of survival was performed using radiomic features and clinical data, separately or in combination. Maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR) and XGBoost were used for feature selection and classification. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were used to assess the prognostic performance of the models on the test datasets. RESULTS For clinical data, cancer comorbidity (q-value<0.01), consciousness level (q-value<0.05) and radiological score involved zone (q-value<0.02) were found to have high correlated features with outcome. Oxygen saturation (AUC=0.73, q-value<0.01) and Blood Urea Nitrogen (AUC=0.72, q-value=0.72) were identified as high clinical features. For lung radiomic features, SAHGLE (AUC=0.70) and HGLZE (AUC=0.67) from GLSZM were identified as most prognostic features. Amongst lesion radiomic features, RLNU from GLRLM (AUC=0.73), HGLZE from GLSZM (AUC=0.73) had the highest performance. In multivariate analysis, combining lung, lesion and clinical features was determined to provide the most accurate prognostic model (AUC=0.95±0.029 (95%CI: 0.95-0.96), accuracy=0.88±0.046 (95% CI: 0.88-0.89), sensitivity=0.88±0.066 (95% CI=0.87-0.9) and specificity=0.89±0.07 (95% CI=0.87-0.9)). CONCLUSION Combination of radiomic features and clinical data can effectively predict outcome in COVID-19 patients. The developed model has significant potential for improved management of COVID-19 patients.","Isaac Shiri,Isaac Shiri,Majid Sorouri,Parham Geramifar,Majid Sorouri,Parham Geramifar,Mostafa Nazari,Mohammad Abdollahi,Mostafa Nazari,Yazdan Salimi,Mohammad Abdollahi,Bardia Khosravi,Yazdan Salimi,Dariush Askari,Bardia Khosravi,Leila Aghaghazvini,Dariush Askari,Leila Aghaghazvini,Ghasem Hajianfar,Ghasem Hajianfar,Amir Kasaeian,Amir Kasaeian,Hamid Abdollahi,Hamid Abdollahi,Hamid Abdollahi,Hossein Arabi,Hossein Arabi,Arman Rahmim,Arman Rahmim,Amir Reza Radmard,Amir Reza Radmard,Habib Zaidi,Habib Zaidi",Computers in Biology and Medicine,2021.0
10.1371/journal.pone.0247330,33661911.0,,Prediction of femoral osteoporosis using machine-learning analysis with radiomics features and abdomen-pelvic CT: A retrospective single center preliminary study.,"BACKGROUND Osteoporosis has increased and developed into a serious public health concern worldwide. Despite the high prevalence, osteoporosis is silent before major fragility fracture and the osteoporosis screening rate is low. Abdomen-pelvic CT (APCT) is one of the most widely conducted medical tests. Artificial intelligence and radiomics analysis have recently been spotlighted. This is the first study to evaluate the prediction performance of femoral osteoporosis using machine-learning analysis with radiomics features and APCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS 500 patients (M: F = 70:430; mean age, 66.5 ± 11.8yrs; range, 50-96 years) underwent both dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and APCT within 1 month. The volume of interest of the left proximal femur was extracted and 41 radiomics features were calculated using 3D volume of interest analysis. Top 10 importance radiomic features were selected by the intraclass correlation coefficient and random forest feature selection. Study cohort was randomly divided into 70% of the samples as the training cohort and the remaining 30% of the sample as the validation cohort. Prediction performance of machine-learning analysis was calculated using diagnostic test and comparison of area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed between training and validation cohorts. RESULTS The osteoporosis prevalence of this study cohort was 20.8%. The prediction performance of the machine-learning analysis to diagnose osteoporosis in the training and validation cohorts were as follows; accuracy, 92.9% vs. 92.7%; sensitivity, 86.6% vs. 80.0%; specificity, 94.5% vs. 95.8%; positive predictive value, 78.4% vs. 82.8%; and negative predictive value, 96.7% vs. 95.0%. The AUC to predict osteoporosis in the training and validation cohorts were 95.9% [95% confidence interval (CI), 93.7%-98.1%] and 96.0% [95% CI, 93.2%-98.8%], respectively, without significant differences (P = 0.962). CONCLUSION Prediction performance of femoral osteoporosis using machine-learning analysis with radiomics features and APCT showed high validity with more than 93% accuracy, specificity, and negative predictive value.","Hyun Lim,Hong Il Ha,Hyun Kyung Lim,Sang Hoon Lee,Sun-Young Park,Hong Il Ha,Junhee Han,Sun-Young Park,Junhee Han",PLOS ONE,2021.0
10.3390/medicina57020094,33494449.0,,Quantitative Imaging and Radiomics in Multiple Myeloma: A Potential Opportunity?,"Multiple Myeloma (MM) is the second most common type of hematological disease and, although it is rare among patients under 40 years of age, its incidence rises in elderly subjects. MM manifestations are usually identified through hyperCalcemia, Renal failure, Anaemia, and lytic Bone lesions (CRAB). In particular, the extent of the bone disease is negatively related to a decreased quality of life in patients and, in general, bone disease in MM increases both morbidity and mortality. The detection of lytic bone lesions on imaging, especially computerized tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), is becoming crucial from the clinical viewpoint to separate asymptomatic from symptomatic MM patients and the detection of focal lytic lesions in these imaging data is becoming relevant even when no clinical symptoms are present. Therefore, radiology is pivotal in the staging and accurate management of patients with MM even in early phases of the disease. In this review, we describe the opportunities offered by quantitative imaging and radiomics in multiple myeloma. At the present time there is still high variability in the choice between various imaging methods to study MM patients and high variability in image interpretation with suboptimal agreement among readers even in tertiary centers. Therefore, the potential of medical imaging for patients affected by MM is still to be completely unveiled. In the coming years, new insights to study MM with medical imaging will derive from artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics usage in different bone lesions and from the wide implementations of quantitative methods to report CT and MRI. Eventually, medical imaging data can be integrated with the patient's outcomes with the purpose of finding radiological biomarkers for predicting the prognostic flow and therapeutic response of the disease.","Alberto Tagliafico,Alberto Tagliafico,Alida Dominietto,A Dominietto,Alida Dominietto,Liliana Belgioia,Cristina Campi,Liliana Belgioia,Daniela Schenone,Cristina Campi,Michele Piana,Daniela Schenone,Michele Piana",Medicina-lithuania,2021.0
10.21037/qims-20-865,,,Quantitative assessment of acquisition imaging parameters on MRI radiomics features: a prospective anthropomorphic phantom study using a 3D-T2W-TSE sequence for MR-guided-radiotherapy.,"Background MRI pulse sequences and imaging parameters substantially influence the variation of MRI radiomics features, thus impose a critical challenge on MRI radiomics reproducibility and reliability. This study aims to prospectively investigate the impact of various imaging parameters on MRI radiomics features in a 3D T2-weighted (T2W) turbo-spin-echo (TSE) pulse sequence for MR-guided-radiotherapy (MRgRT). Methods An anthropomorphic phantom was scanned using a 3D-T2W-TSE MRgRT sequence at 1.5T under a variety of acquisition imaging parameter changes. T1 and T2 relaxation times of the phantom were also measured. 93 first-order and texture radiomics features in the original and 14 transformed images, yielding 1,395 features in total, were extracted from 10 volumes-of-interest (VOIs). The percentage deviation (d%) of radiomics feature values from the baseline values and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) with the baseline were calculated. Robust radiomics features were identified based on the excellent agreement of radiomics feature values with the baseline, i.e., the averaged d%  0.90 in all VOIs for all imaging parameter variations. Results The radiomics feature values changed considerably but to different degrees with different imaging parameter adjustments, in the ten VOIs. The deviation d% ranged from 0.02% to 321.3%, with a mean of 12.5% averaged for all original features in all ten VOIs. First-order and GLCM features were generally more robust to imaging parameters than other features in the original images. There were also significantly different radiomics feature values (ANOVA, P<0.001) between the original and the transformed images, exhibiting quite different robustness to imaging parameters. 330 out of 1395 features (23.7%) robust to imaging parameters were identified. GLCM and GLSZM features had the most (42.5%, 153/360) and least (3.8%, 9/240) robust features in the original and transformed images, respectively. Conclusions This study helps better understand the quantitative dependence of radiomics feature values on imaging parameters in a 3D-T2W-TSE sequence for MRgRT. Imaging parameter heterogeneity should be considered as a significant source of radiomics variability and uncertainty, which must be well harmonized for reliable clinical use. The identified robust features to imaging parameters are helpful for the pre-selection of radiomics features for reliable radiomics modeling.","Jing Yuan,Cindy Xue,Jing Yuan,Cindy Xue,Gladys Lo,Cindy Xue,Oi Lei Wong,Gladys Lo,Oi Lei Wong,Yihang Zhou,Yihang Zhou,Siu Ki Yu,Siu Ki Yu,K.Y.

We hypothesize that radiomic features would be useful as inclusion/exclusion criteria for patient enrichment in clinical trials and aimed to develop the appropriate framework for this analysis.Methods This was tested among soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) patients accrued into a randomized clinical trial (SARC021) that evaluated the efficacy of evofosfamide (Evo), a hypoxia activated prodrug, in combination with doxorubicin (Dox). Notably, SARC021 failed to meet its survival objective. We tested whether a radiomic biomarker-driven inclusion/exclusion criterion could have been used to result in a significant treatment benefit of the Evo+Dox combination compared to the standard Dox monotherapy. A total of 166 radiomics features were extracted from 303 patients from the SARC021trial with lung metastases, divided into a training and test set. Univariable and multivariable models were utilized to discriminate OS in the two treatment groups.  Findings A single radiomics feature, Short Run Emphasis, was the most informative. When combined with histological classification and smoking history, an enriched subset (42%) of patients had longer OS in Evo+Dox vs. Dox groups [p=0.01, Hazard Ratio (HR) =0.57 (0.36-0.90)]. Application of the same model and threshold value in an independent test set confirmed the significant survival difference (p=0.002, HR=0.29 (0.13-0.63)). This process also identifies patients most likely to benefit from doxorubicin alone. Interpretation The study presents a first of its kind radiomic approach for patient enrichment in clinical trials.

Methods  An anthropomorphic phantom was scanned at 1.5 T using a standardized sequence for MR-guided radiotherapy under SENSE and compressed-SENSE reconstruction settings. A total of 93 first-order and texture radiomics features in 10 volumes of interest were assessed based on (1) accuracy measured by the percentage deviation from the reference, (2) robustness on reconstruction in all volumes of interest measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient, and (3) repeatability measured by the coefficient of variance over the repetitive acquisitions. Finally, reliable and unreliable radiomics features were comprehensively determined based on their accuracy, robustness, and repeatability.  Results  Better accuracy and robustness of the radiomics features were achieved under SENSE than compressed-SENSE reconstruction. The feature accuracy under SENSE reconstruction was more affected by acceleration factor than direction, whereas under compressed-SENSE reconstruction, accuracy was substantially impacted by the increasing denoising levels. Feature repeatability was dependent more on feature types than on reconstruction. A total of 45 reliable features and 13 unreliable features were finally determined for SENSE, compared with 22 reliable and 26 unreliable features for compressed SENSE. First-order and gray-level co-occurrence matrix features were generally more reliable than other features.  Conclusion  Radiomics features could be substantially affected by MRI reconstruction, so precautions need to be taken regarding their reliability for clinical use.

However, despite its increasingly established application, there is a need for standardisation criteria and further validation of feature robustness with respect to imaging acquisition parameters. In this paper, the robustness of radiomic features extracted from computed tomography (CT) images is evaluated for liver tumour and muscle, comparing the values of the features in images reconstructed with two different slice thicknesses of 2.0mm and 5.0mm. Novel approaches are presented to address the intrinsic dependencies of texture radiomic features, choosing the optimal number of grey levels and correcting for the dependency on volume. With the optimal values and corrections, feature values are compared across thicknesses to identify reproducible features. Normalisation using muscle regions is also described as an alternative approach. With either method, a large fraction of features (75-90%) was found to be highly robust (<25% difference).

10.3390/diagnostics11050795,33924854.0,,The Heterogeneity of Skewness in T2W-Based Radiomics Predicts the Response to Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer.,"Our study aimed to investigate whether radiomics on MRI sequences can differentiate responder (R) and non-responder (NR) patients based on the tumour regression grade (TRG) assigned after surgical resection in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). Eighty-five patients undergoing primary staging with MRI were retrospectively evaluated, and 40 patients were finally selected. The ROIs were manually outlined in the tumour site on T2w sequences in the oblique-axial plane. Based on the TRG, patients were grouped as having either a complete or a partial response (TRG = (0,1), n = 15). NR patients had a minimal or poor nCRT response (TRG = (2,3), n = 25). Eighty-four local first-order radiomic features (RFs) were extracted from tumour ROIs. Only single RFs were investigated. Each feature was selected using univariate analysis guided by a one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum. ROC curve analysis was performed, using AUC computation and the Youden index (YI) for sensitivity and specificity. The RF measuring the heterogeneity of local skewness of T2w values from tumour ROIs differentiated Rs and NRs with a p-value ≈ 10-5; AUC = 0.90 (95%CI, 0.73-0.96); and YI = 0.68, corresponding to 80% sensitivity and 88% specificity. In conclusion, higher heterogeneity in skewness maps of the baseline tumour correlated with a greater benefit from nCRT.","Francesca Coppola,Francesca Coppola,Margherita Mottola,Silvia Lo Monaco,Margherita Mottola,Silvia Lo Monaco,Arrigo Cattabriga,Silvia Lo Monaco,Maria Adriana Cocozza,Arrigo Cattabriga,Jia Cheng Yuan,Maria Adriana Cocozza,Caterina De Benedittis,Jia Cheng Yuan,Dajana Cuicchi,Caterina De Benedittis,A.

Methods  Fifty-one patients with HNSCC were treated with RT (70 Gy/33 fractions) (+/- concurrent chemotherapy) were included. QUS Data acquisition involved scanning an index neck node with a clinical ultrasound device. Radiofrequency data were collected before starting RT, and after weeks 1, and 4. From this data, 31 spectral and related-texture features were determined for each time and delta (difference) features were computed. Patients were categorized into two groups based on clinical outcomes (recurrence or non-recurrence). Three machine learning classifiers were used for the development of a radiomics model. Features were selected using a forward sequential selection method and validated using leave-one-out cross-validation.    Results  The median follow up for the entire group was 38 months (range 7 to 64 months). The disease sites involved neck masses in patients with oropharynx (39), larynx (5), carcinoma unknown primary (5), and hypopharynx carcinoma (2). Concurrent chemotherapy and cetuximab were used in 41 and 1 patient(s), respectively. Recurrence was seen in 17 patients. At week 1 of RT, the support vector machine classifier resulted in the best performance, with accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) of 80% and 0.75, respectively. The accuracy and AUC improved to 82% and 0.81, respectively, at week 4 of treatment.    Conclusion  QUS Delta-radiomics can predict higher risk of recurrence with reasonable accuracy in HNSCC.

10.3389/fonc.2021.633176,,,Understanding Sources of Variation to Improve the Reproducibility of Radiomics.,"Radiomics is the method of choice for investigating the association between cancer imaging phenotype, cancer genotype and clinical outcome prediction in the era of precision medicine. The fast dispersal of this new methodology has benefited from the existing advances of the core technologies involved in radiomics workflow: image acquisition, tumor segmentation, feature extraction and machine learning. However, despite the rapidly increasing body of publications, there is no real clinical use of a developed radiomics signature so far. Reasons are multifaceted. One of the major challenges is the lack of reproducibility and generalizability of the reported radiomics signatures (features and models). Sources of variation exist in each step of the workflow; some are controllable or can be controlled to certain degrees, while others are uncontrollable or even unknown. Insufficient transparency in reporting radiomics studies further prevents translation of the developed radiomics signatures from the bench to the bedside. This review article first addresses sources of variation, which is illustrated using demonstrative examples. Then, it reviews a number of published studies and progresses made to date in the investigation and improvement of feature reproducibility and model performance. Lastly, it discusses potential strategies and practical considerations to reduce feature variability and improve the quality of radiomics study. This review focuses on CT image acquisition, tumor segmentation, quantitative feature extraction, and the disease of lung cancer.","Binsheng Zhao,Binsheng Zhao,Binsheng Zhao",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0

METHODS T2 -weighted images of a pelvic phantom were acquired on three scanners of two manufacturers and two magnetic field strengths. The repeatability and reproducibility of features were assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficient and the concordance correlation coefficient, respectively, and by the within-subject coefficient of variation, considering repeated acquisitions with and without phantom repositioning, and with different scanner and acquisition parameters. The features showing intraclass correlation coefficient or concordance correlation coefficient >0.9 were selected, and their dependence on shape information (Spearman's ρ > 0.8) analyzed. They were classified for their ability to distinguish textures, after shuffling voxel intensities of images. RESULTS From 944 two-dimensional features, 79.9% to 96.4% showed excellent repeatability in fixed position across all scanners. A much lower range (11.2% to 85.4%) was obtained after phantom repositioning. Three-dimensional extraction did not improve repeatability performance. Excellent reproducibility between scanners was observed in 4.6% to 15.6% of the features, at fixed imaging parameters. In addition, 82.4% to 94.9% of the features showed excellent agreement when extracted from images acquired with echo times 5 ms apart, but decreased with increasing echo-time intervals, and 90.7% of the features exhibited excellent reproducibility for changes in pulse repetition time. Of nonshape features, 2.0% was identified as providing only shape information. CONCLUSION We showed that radiomic features are affected by MRI protocols and propose a general workflow to identify repeatable, reproducible, and informative radiomic features to ensure robustness of clinical studies.","Linda Bianchini,Linda Bianchini,João Santinha,Nuno Loução,João Santinha,Mário A.

This study focuses on an Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) based approach, investigating the diagnostic role of 1st and 2nd order ADC statistics features, in differentiating benign from malignant breast lesion status. A total of 67 patients with 78 histologically verified breast lesions (40 benign and 38 malignant) was analyzed. ADC maps were generated for a slice representative of lesion largest diameter, considering intra Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) sequence non rigid registration scheme. Lesion segments were defined by semi-automated Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) segmentation on high b-value diffusion images and propagated on ADC maps.27 (11 1st order statistics and 16 2nd order statistics (texture) features were derived. To avoid overfitting a stepwise feature selection method was employed, while the discriminating ability of features was evaluated with univariate and multivariate Logistic Regression classification. The classification performance of the diagnostic model was evaluated by means of the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (Az index). A combination of two features, one from 1st order statistics (25th Percentile) and one from 2nd order statistics, (texture Entropy), achieved high classification performance (Az=0.965±0.024), suggesting both the diagnostic significance of 1st order statistics and texture biomarkers of the ADC map representation.","Marialena I.

This requires large-scale radiomics data analysis, hence the need for integrating radiomic features extracted from images acquired in different centers. This is challenging as radiomic features exhibit variable sensitivity to differences in scanner model, acquisition protocols and reconstruction settings, which is similar to the so-called 'batch-effects' in genomics studies.

A stratified random sample of 283 patients (20%) was used as the testing set (173 ADC and 110 SCC); the remaining data were used as the training set. A total of 688 features were extracted from each outlined tumour region. Ten feature selection techniques, ten machine learning (ML) models and the VGG16 deep learning (DL) algorithm were evaluated to construct an optimal classification model for the differential diagnosis of ADC and SCC. Tenfold cross-validation and grid search technique were employed to evaluate and optimize the model hyperparameters on the training dataset. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity was used to evaluate the performance of the models on the test dataset. Fifty top-ranked subset features were selected by each feature selection technique for classification.

While radiological research has focused on scanner and sequence technologies in recent decades, applications of artificial intelligence are increasingly attracting scientific interest as they could substantially expand the possibility of objective quantification and diagnostic or prognostic use of image information.   In this context, the term “radiomics” describes the extraction of quantitative features from imaging data such as those obtained from computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging examinations. These features are associated with predictive goals such as diagnosis or prognosis using machine learning models. It is believed that the integrative assessment of the feature patterns thus obtained, in combination with clinical, molecular and genetic data, can enable a more accurate characterization of the pathophysiology of diseases and more precise prediction of therapy response and outcome.   This review describes the classical radiomics approach and discusses the existing very large variability of approaches. Finally, it outlines the research directions in which the interdisciplinary field of radiology and computer science is moving, characterized by increasingly close collaborations and the need for new educational concepts. The aim is to provide a basis for responsible and comprehensible handling of the data and analytical methods used.     Key points:     Citation Format","Ulrike Attenberger,Georg Langs,Ulrike I.

RECENT FINDINGS Radiomics involves the high-throughput extraction of radiologic features from clinical imaging, using a panel of sophisticated data-characterization algorithms to make an objective and quantitative determination of diagnoses and clinical characteristics. Radiomics evaluation of existing clinical images would increase their clinical value in many cancer management pathways, including PCa. However, a consensus on the implementation of radiomics has not been established across different sites, delaying its implementation in clinical practice. There are many potential advantages to radiomics. The ability to extract features from existing clinical imaging is one such advantage. A second is the empiric nature of the analysis. The third lies in the application of new technologies, such as machine learning, to be able to evaluate large quantities of data to make clinical conclusions. In this systematic review, we identify publications regarding the role of radiomics in PCa detection and evaluation. Many of these studies noted that radiomics, when incorporated into predictive models, had an advantageous impact on detection of PCa, clinically significant PCa, and extracapsular extension. This may assist in individualized decision making not only for diagnosis of PCa, but also for surveillance and surgical planning. With additional validation in large sample sizes, and randomized, multicenter studies using a consensus driven methodology, radiomics has the potential to alter the landscape of PCa detection and management, necessitating further prospective randomized investigation. SUMMARY Radiomics is a promising new field, allowing for high-throughput analysis of imaging features for PCa detection and evaluation. These features can be extracted from existing data; therefore, the potential for future study is immense.","Dordaneh Sugano,Daniel Sanford,Dordaneh Sugano,André Luís de Castro Abreu,Daniel Sanford,Vinay Duddalwar,Andre Luis de Castro Abreu,Vinay Duddalwar,Inderbir S.

While MRI-based radiomics is still at an early stage, it showed some promising results in studies focusing on breast cancer patients in improving diagnoses and therapy response assessment. Nevertheless, the use of radiomics raises a number of issues regarding feature quantification and robustness. Therefore, our study aim was to determine the robustness of radiomics features extracted by two commonly used radiomics software with respect to variability in manual breast tumor segmentation on MRI. A total of 129 histologically confirmed breast tumors were segmented manually in three dimensions on the first post-contrast T1-weighted MR exam by four observers: a dedicated breast radiologist, a resident, a Ph.D. candidate, and a medical student. Robust features were assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC>0.9). The inter-observer variability was evaluated by the volumetric Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). The mean DSC for all tumors was 0.81 (range 0.19-0.96), indicating a good spatial overlap of the segmentations based on observers of varying expertise. In total, 41.6% (552/1328) and 32.8% (273/833) of all RadiomiX and Pyradiomics features, respectively, were identified as robust and were independent of inter-observer manual segmentation variability.","R.

Hand-crafted features, however, are pre-defined and extracted without taking the desired target into account. Furthermore, accurate segmentation of the tumor is required for development of a reliable predictive model, which may be objective and a time-consuming task. To address these drawbacks, we propose a deep learning-based radiomics model for the time-to-event outcome prediction, referred to as DRTOP that takes raw images as inputs, and calculates the image-based risk of death or recurrence, for each patient. Our experiments on an in-house dataset of 132 lung cancer patients show that the obtained image-based risks are significant predictors of the time-to-event outcomes. Computed Tomography (CT)-based features are predictors of the overall survival (OS), with the hazard ratio (HR) of 1.35, distant control (DC), with HR of 1.06, and local control (LC), with HR of 2.66. The Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-based features are predictors of OS and recurrence free survival (RFS), with hazard ratios of 1.67 and 1.18, respectively. The concordance indices of $$68\%$$, $$63\%$$, and $$64\%$$ for predicting the OS, DC, and RFS show that the deep learning-based radiomics model is as accurate or better in predicting predefined clinical outcomes compared to hand-crafted radiomics, with concordance indices of $$51\%$$, $$64\%$$, and $$47\%$$, for predicting the OS, DC, and RFS, respectively.

METHODS One hundred patients were included in this retrospective dual-center study: 48 with histology-proven cholesteatoma (center A: 23; center B: 25) and 52 with MEI (A: 27; B: 25). Radiomic features (co-occurrence and run-length matrix, absolute gradient, autoregressive model, Haar wavelet transform) were extracted from manually defined 2D-ROIs. The ten best features for lesion differentiation were selected using probability of error and average correlation coefficients. A multi-layer perceptron feed-forward artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) was used for radiomics-based classification, with histopathology serving as the reference standard (70% of cases for training, 30% for validation). The analysis was performed five times each on (a) unmodified data and on data that were (b) resampled to the same matrix size, and (c) corrected for acquisition protocol differences using ComBat harmonization. RESULTS Using unmodified data, the MLP-ANN classification yielded an overall median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78 (0.72-0.84). Using original data from center A and resampled data from center B, an overall median AUC of 0.88 (0.82-0.99) was yielded, while using ComBat harmonized data, an overall median AUC of 0.89 (0.79-0.92) was revealed. CONCLUSION Radiomic features extracted from HRCT differentiate between cholesteatoma and MEI. When using multi-centric data obtained with differences in CT acquisition parameters, data resampling and ComBat post-reconstruction harmonization clearly improve radiomics-based lesion classification. KEY POINTS • Unenhanced high-resolution CT coupled with radiomics analysis may be useful for the differentiation between cholesteatoma and middle ear inflammation. • Pooling of data extracted from inhomogeneous CT datasets does not appear meaningful without further post-processing. • When using multi-centric CT data obtained with differences in acquisition parameters, post-reconstruction harmonization and data resampling clearly improve radiomics-based soft-tissue differentiation.","Christophe Arendt,Christophe T.

10.1038/s41598-021-80998-y,33446870.0,,Improving prognostic performance in resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma using radiomics and deep learning features fusion in CT images,"As an analytic pipeline for quantitative imaging feature extraction and analysis, radiomics has grown rapidly in the past decade. On the other hand, recent advances in deep learning and transfer learning have shown significant potential in the quantitative medical imaging field, raising the research question of whether deep transfer learning features have predictive information in addition to radiomics features. In this study, using CT images from Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients recruited in two independent hospitals, we discovered most transfer learning features have weak linear relationships with radiomics features, suggesting a potential complementary relationship between these two feature sets. We also tested the prognostic performance for overall survival using four feature fusion and reduction methods for combining radiomics and transfer learning features and compared the results with our proposed risk score-based feature fusion method. It was shown that the risk score-based feature fusion method significantly improves the prognosis performance for predicting overall survival in PDAC patients compared to other traditional feature reduction methods used in previous radiomics studies (40% increase in area under ROC curve (AUC) yielding AUC of 0.84).","Yucheng Zhang,Edrise M.

10.3390/tomography8010028,,,AI-Radiomics Can Improve Inclusion Criteria and Clinical Trial Performance,"Purpose: Success of clinical trials increasingly relies on effective selection of the target patient populations. We hypothesize that computational analysis of pre-accrual imaging data can be used for patient enrichment to better identify patients who can potentially benefit from investigational agents. Methods: This was tested retrospectively in soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) patients accrued into a randomized clinical trial (SARC021) that evaluated the efficacy of evofosfamide (Evo), a hypoxia activated prodrug, in combination with doxorubicin (Dox). Notably, SARC021 failed to meet its overall survival (OS) objective. We tested whether a radiomic biomarker-driven inclusion/exclusion criterion could have been used to improve the difference between the two arms (Evo + Dox vs. Dox) of the study. 164 radiomics features were extracted from 296 SARC021 patients with lung metastases, divided into training and test sets. Results: A single radiomics feature, Short Run Emphasis (SRE), was representative of a group of correlated features that were the most informative. The SRE feature value was combined into a model along with histological classification and smoking history. This model as able to identify an enriched subset (52%) of patients who had a significantly longer OS in Evo + Dox vs. Dox groups [p = 0.036, Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.64 (0.42–0.97)]. Applying the same model and threshold value in an independent test set confirmed the significant survival difference [p = 0.016, HR = 0.42 (0.20–0.85)]. Notably, this model was best at identifying exclusion criteria for patients most likely to benefit from doxorubicin alone. Conclusions: The study presents a first of its kind clinical-radiomic approach for patient enrichment in clinical trials. We show that, had an appropriate model been used for selective patient inclusion, SARC021 trial could have met its primary survival objective for patients with metastatic STS.","Michal R.

10.1259/bjr.20211048,,,Prediction of invasive adenocarcinomas manifesting as pure ground-glass nodules based on radiomic signature of low-dose CT in lung cancer screening,"Objectives: To develop a radiomic model based on low-dose CT (LDCT) to distinguish invasive adenocarcinomas (IAs) from adenocarcinoma in situ/minimally invasive adenocarcinomas (AIS/MIAs) manifesting as pure ground-glass nodules (pGGNs) and compare its performance with conventional quantitative and semantic features of LDCT, radiomic model of standard-dose CT, and intraoperative frozen section (FS). Methods: A total of 147 consecutive pathologically confirmed pGGNs were divided into primary cohort (43 IAs and 60 AIS/MIAs) and validation cohort (19 IAs and 25 AIS/MIAs). Logistic regression models were built using conventional quantitative and semantic features, selected radiomic features of LDCT and standard-dose CT, and intraoperative FS diagnosis, respectively. The diagnostic performance was assessed by area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Results: The AUCs of quantitative-semantic model, radiomic model of LDCT, radiomic model of standard-dose CT, and FS model were 0.879 (95% CI, 0.801–0.935), 0.929 (95% CI, 0.862–0.971), 0.941 (95% CI, 0.876–0.978), and 0.884 (95% CI, 0.805–0.938) in the primary cohort and 0.897 (95% CI, 0.768–0.968), 0.933 (95% CI, 0.815–0.986), 0.901 (95% CI, 0.773–0.970), and 0.828 (95% CI, 0.685–0.925) in the validation cohort. No significant difference of the AUCs was found among these models in both the primary and validation cohorts (all p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: The LDCT-based quantitative-semantic score and radiomic signature, with good predictive performance, can be preoperative and non-invasive biomarkers for assessing the invasive risk of pGGNs in lung cancer screening. Advances in knowledge: The LDCT-based quantitative-semantic score and radiomic signature, with the equivalent performance to the radiomic model of standard-dose CT, can be preoperative predictors for assessing the invasiveness of pGGNs in lung cancer screening and reducing excess examination and treatment.","Yong Li,Yong Li,Jieke Liu,Jieke Liu,Xi Yang,Xi Yang,Hao Xu,Hao Xu,Haomiao Qing,Haomiao Qing,Jing Ren,Jing Ren,Peng Zhou,Peng Zhou",British Journal of Radiology,2022.0

Of the 572 articles, 29 relevant original research articles were included and evaluated according to the RQS, TRIPOD checklist, and IBSI guidelines.External validation was performed in only three studies (10.3%). The median RQS was 3.0 (range, -6 to 12), with a low basic adherence rate of 50.0%. The adherence rate was low in comparison to the ""gold standard"" (10.3%), stating the potential clinical utility (10.3%), performing the cut-off analysis (3.4%), reporting calibration statistics (6.9%), and providing open science and data (3.4%). None of the studies involved test-retest or phantom studies, prospective studies, or cost-effectiveness analyses. The overall rate of adherence to the TRIPOD checklist was 60.3% and low for reporting title (3.4%), blind assessment of outcome (0%), description of the handling of missing data (0%), and presentation of the full prediction model (0%).

10.3389/fnagi.2021.789099,,,Radiomic Features of the Hippocampus for Diagnosing Early-Onset and Late-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease,"Background : Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) and early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD) are different subtypes of AD. This study aimed to build and validate radiomics models of the hippocampus for EOAD and young controls (YCs), LOAD and old controls (OCs), as well as EOAD and LOAD. Methods : Thirty-six EOAD patients, 36 LOAD patients, 36 YCs, and 36 OCs from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were enrolled and allocated to training and test sets of the EOAD-YC groups, LOAD-OC groups, and EOAD-LOAD groups. Independent external validation sets including 15 EOAD patients, 15 LOAD patients, 15 YCs, and 15 OCs from Shanghai Mental Health Center were constructed, respectively. Bilateral hippocampal segmentation and feature extraction were performed for each subject, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used to select radiomic features. Support vector machine (SVM) models were constructed based on the identified features to distinguish EOAD from YC subjects, LOAD from OC subjects, and EOAD from LOAD subjects. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Results : Three, three, and four features were selected for EOAD and YC subjects, LOAD and OC subjects, and EOAD and LOAD subjects, respectively. The AUC and accuracy of the SVM model were 0.90 and 0.77 in the test set and 0.91 and 0.87 in the validation set for EOAD and YC subjects, respectively; for LOAD and OC subjects, the AUC and accuracy were 0.94 and 0.86 in the test set and 0.92 and 0.78 in the validation set, respectively. For the SVM model of EOAD and LOAD subjects, the AUC was 0.87 and the accuracy was 0.79 in the test set; additionally, the AUC was 0.86 and the accuracy was 0.77 in the validation set. Conclusion : The findings of this study provide insights into the potential of hippocampal radiomic features as biomarkers to diagnose EOAD and LOAD. This study is the first to show that SVM classification analysis based on hippocampal radiomic features is a valuable method for clinical applications in EOAD.","Yang Du,Yang Du,Shaowei Zhang,Shaowei Zhang,Yuan Fang,Yuan Fang,Qi Qiu,Qi Qiu,Lu Zhao,Lu Zhao,Wenjing Wei,Wenjing Wei,Yingying Tang,Yingying Tang,Xia Li,Xia Li",Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,2022.0
10.3390/jcm11030616,,,Radiomics in Triple Negative Breast Cancer: New Horizons in an Aggressive Subtype of the Disease,"In the last decade, the analysis of the medical images has evolved significantly, applications and tools capable to extract quantitative characteristics of the images beyond the discrimination capacity of the investigator’s eye being developed. The applications of this new research field, called radiomics, presented an exponential growth with direct implications in the diagnosis and prediction of response to therapy. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer subtype with a severe prognosis, despite the aggressive multimodal treatments applied according to the guidelines. Radiomics has already proven the ability to differentiate TNBC from fibroadenoma. Radiomics features extracted from digital mammography may also distinguish between TNBC and non-TNBC. Recent research has identified three distinct subtypes of TNBC using IRM breast images voxel-level radiomics features (size/shape related features, texture features, sharpness). The correlation of these TNBC subtypes with the clinical response to neoadjuvant therapy may lead to the identification of biomarkers in order to guide the clinical decision. Furthermore, the variation of some radiomics features in the neoadjuvant settings provides a tool for the rapid evaluation of treatment efficacy. The association of radiomics features with already identified biomarkers can generate complex predictive and prognostic models. Standardization of image acquisition and also of radiomics feature extraction is required to validate this method in clinical practice.","Camil Ciprian Mireştean,Camil Ciprian Mirestean,Camil Ciprian Mireștean,Constantin Volovăț,Constantin Volovăţ,Roxana Irina Iancu,Roxana Irina Iancu,Dragoș Petru Teodor Iancu,Dragoș Petru Teodor Iancu",Journal of Clinical Medicine,2022.0

Materials and Methods We collected data from 197 NPC patients. For each patient, radiomic features were extracted from the CT image acquired at pretreatment via PyRadiomics. Feature selection was performed in two steps. First, features with high inter-observer variability based on multiple tumor delineations were excluded. Then, stratified bootstrappings were performed to identify feature combinations that most frequently achieved the highest (i) area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting 3-year OS, PFS, and DMFS or (ii) Harrell’s C-index for predicting time to event. Finally, regularized logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models with the most frequently selected feature combinations as input were tuned using cross-validation. Additionally, we examined the robustness of the constructed model to variation in tumor delineation by simulating 100 realizations of radiomic feature values to mimic features extracted from different tumor boundaries. Results The combined model that used both radiomics and clinical features yielded significantly higher AUC and Harrell’s C-index than models using either feature set alone for all outcomes ( p &amp;lt; 0.05). The AUCs and Harrell’s C-indices of the clinical-only and radiomics-only models ranged from 0.758 ± 0.091 to 0.789 ± 0.082 and from 0.747 ± 0.062 to 0.767 ± 0.074, respectively. In comparison, the combined models achieved AUC of 0.801 ± 0.075 to 0.813 ± 0.078 and Harrell’s C-indices of 0.779 ± 0.066 to 0.796 ± 0.069. The results showed that our models were robust to variation in tumor delineation with the coefficient of variation ranging from 4.8% to 6.4% and from 6.7% to 9.3% for AUC and Harrell’s C-index, respectively. Conclusion Our results demonstrated that using CT-based radiomic features together with clinical features provided superior NPC prognostic prediction than using either clinical or radiomic features alone.","Sararas Intarak,Sararas Intarak,Yuda Chongpison,Yuda Chongpison,Mananchaya Vimolnoch,Mananchaya Vimolnoch,Sornjarod Oonsiri,Sornjarod Oonsiri,Sarin Kitpanit,Sarin Kitpanit,Anussara Prayongrat,Anussara Prayongrat,Danita Kannarunimit,Danita Kannarunimit,Chakkapong Chakkabat,Chakkapong Chakkabat,Sira Sriswasdi,Sira Sriswasdi,Chawalit Lertbutsayanukul,Chawalit Lertbutsayanukul,Yothin Rakvongthai,Yothin Rakvongthai",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0

Radiomics analysis can be performed by extracting hand-crafted radiomics features or via deep learning algorithms. Radiomics has evolved tremendously in the last decade, becoming a bridge between imaging and precision medicine. Radiomics exploits sophisticated image analysis tools coupled with statistical elaboration to extract the wealth of information hidden inside medical images, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and/or Positron emission tomography (PET) scans, routinely performed in the everyday clinical practice. Many efforts have been devoted in recent years to the standardization and validation of radiomics approaches, to demonstrate their usefulness and robustness beyond any reasonable doubts. However, the booming of publications and commercial applications of radiomics approaches warrant caution and proper understanding of all the factors involved to avoid ""scientific pollution"" and overly enthusiastic claims by researchers and clinicians alike. For these reasons the present review aims to be a guidebook of sorts, describing the process of radiomics, its pitfalls, challenges, and opportunities, along with its ability to improve clinical decision-making, from oncology and respiratory medicine to pharmacological and genotyping studies.","Julien Guiot,Julien Guiot,Akshayaa Vaidyanathan,Akshayaa Vaidyanathan,Louis Deprez,Louis Deprez,Fadila Zerka,Fadila Zerka,Denis Danthine,Denis Danthine,Anne‐Noëlle Frix,Philippe Lambin,Anne-Noëlle Frix,Fabio Bottari,Philippe Lambin,Fabio Bottari,Fabio Bottari,Nathan Tsoutzidis,Nathan Tsoutzidis,Benjamin Miraglio,Benjamin Miraglio,Seán Walsh,Sean Walsh,Wim Vos,Wim Vos,Roland Hustinx,Roland Hustinx,Marta S.

This stuy aims to explore the value of radiomics based on BOLD-MRI in differentiating malignant from benign renal tumors. METHODS A total of 141 patients with renal tumors confirmed by pathology were retrospectively analyzed. Seventy-four men and sixty-seven women, aged 26-78 years, with a median age of 56, were included. In all patients, 118 with malignant tumors and 23 with benign tumors were confirmed. All the patients underwent renal T1 weighted imaging (T1WI), T2 weighted imaging (T2WI), and BOLD-MRI scan within 2 weeks before surgery. The patients were randomly assigned into a training group (benign, n=17; malignant, n=83) and a test group (benign, n=6; malignant, n=35). Two radiologists (A and B), who were blind to the pathological results, delineated the regions of interest (ROI) on the maximum axial slices of the tumors. Radiologist B delineated the ROI again at an interval of one month. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate inter-observer and intra-observer repeatability and ICC>0.75 represented as a good consistency. All the T2* Mapping images and the related ROI files were loaded into the Artificial Intelligence Kit software. A total of 396 texture features, which were calculated based on morphology, histogram, gray level co-occurrence matrix, gray-scale run length matrix, gray-scale area size matrix and gray-scale dependent matrix, were extracted from each ROI. The lowest redundancy and the highest correlation were filtered using minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm. Then least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was used to screened out the most predictive features. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to develop the prediction model after feature selection. The radiomics signature score (Radscore) of each case was calculated. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the difference in the Radscore between benign and malignant renal tumors in the training and test groups. The diagnostic performance of the model in differentiating malignant from benign renal tumors was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and leave group out cross validation. The clinical application value of the model was evaluated by decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS There was significant difference in the age between the patients with benign and those with malignant tumors (t=4.383, P<0.001). There were no significant differences in gender composition and in the largest tumor diameter between the 2 groups (χ2=3.452, P=0.063; t=1.432, P=0.154). The ICC values of all the texture features for the inter-observer repeatability were ranged from 0.71 to 0.87, and the ICC values for the intra-observer repeatability were ranged from 0.76 to 0.91. Thirty features with the lowest redundancy and the highest correlation were screened out. The most predictive 12 features were filtered out. The Radscores of malignant tumors in the training and test groups were higher than those of benign tumors (P<0.001 and P=0.006, respectively). The areas under the ROC curve of the model developed by multivariable logistic regression for differentiating malignant from benign renal tumors in the training and test groups were 0.881 and 0.706, with the accuracy at 82.93% and 79.00%, the sensitivity at 82.86% and 77.11%, and the specificities at 83.33% and 88.24%, respectively. The results of decision curve analysis showed that the net benefit of the radiomics model was higher than that of ""all malignant"" or ""all benign"" when the threshold was higher than 0.3. CONCLUSIONS BOLD-MRI-based radiomics can be a reliable non-invasive approach for differentiating renal malignant tumors from benign tumors.","Yelan Deng,Yelan Deng,Pan Liang,Wei Xing,Liang Pan,Zhi Wei Zhou,Wei Xing,Zhi Zhou,Jie Chen,Jie Chen",Journal of Central South University.

10.1002/mp.15043,34120354.0,,Assessing the reproducibility of CBCT-derived radiomics features using a novel three-dimensional printed phantom.,"Purpose  Radiomics modelling is an exciting avenue for enhancing clinical decision-making and personalized treatment. Radiation oncology patients often undergo routine imaging for position verification, particularly using LINAC-mounted cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). The wealth of imaging data collected in modern radiation therapy presents an ideal use case for radiomics modelling. Despite this, texture feature (TF) calculation can be limited by concerns over feature stability and reproducibility; in theory this issue is compounded by the relatively poor image quality of CBCT, as well as variation of acquisition and reconstruction parameters.  Methods  In this study, we developed and validated a novel 3D-printed phantom for evaluating CBCT-based texture feature reliability. The phantom has a cylindrical shape (22 cm diameter and 25.5 cm height) with five inner inserts designed to hold custom-printed rods (1 cm diameter and 10-20 cm height) of various materials, infill shapes, and densities. TF reproducibility was evaluated across and within three LINACs from a single vendor using sets of three consecutive CBCT taken with the head, thorax, and pelvis clinical imaging protocols. PyRadiomics was used to extract a standard set of TFs from regions of interest centered on each rod. Two way mixed effects absolute agreement intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate TF reproducibility, with features showing ICC values above 0.9 considered robust if their Bonferroni-corrected p-value was below 0.05.  Results  A total of 63, 87, and 83 features exhibited test-retest reliability for the head, thorax, and pelvis imaging protocols respectively. When assessing stability between discreet imaging sessions on the same LINAC these numbers were reduced to 5, 63, and 70 features respectively. The thorax and pelvis protocols maintained a rich candidate feature space in inter-LINAC analysis with 61 and 65 features, respectively, exceeding the ICC criteria. Crucially, no features were deemed reproducible when compared between protocols.  Conclusions  We have developed a 3D-phantom for consistent evaluation of texture feature stability and reproducibility. For LINACs from a single vendor, our study found a substantial number of features available for robust radiomics modelling from CBCT imaging. However, some features showed variations across LINACs. Studies involving CBCT-based radiomics must pre-select features prior to their use in clinical-based models.","Karl Spuhler,Karl D. Spuhler,Karl D Spuhler,Karl Spuhler,Jose R. Teruel,Jose R.

We then verified its predictive performance by cross-referencing its results with clinical characteristics. This two-center retrospective analysis included 125 patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC. A total of 1287 hand-crafted radiomic features were observed from manually determined tumor regions. Valuable features were then selected with a ridge regression-based recursive feature elimination approach. Machine learning-based prediction models were then built from this and compared each other. The final radiomic signature was built using logistic regression in the primary cohort, and then tested in a validation cohort. Finally, we compared the efficacy of the radiomic signature to the clinical model and the radiomic-clinical nomogram. Among the 125 patients, 89 were classified as having PD-L1 positive expression. However, there was no significant difference in PD-L1 expression levels determined by clinical characteristics (P=0.109-0.955). Upon selecting 9 radiomic features, we found that the logistic regression-based prediction model performed the best (AUC=0.96, P<0.001). In the external cohort, our radiomic signature showed an AUC of 0.85, which outperformed both the clinical model (AUC=0.38, P<0.001) and the radiomics-nomogram model (AUC=0.61, P<0.001). Our CT-based hand-crafted radiomic signature model can effectively predict PD-L1 expression levels, providing a noninvasive means of better understanding PD-L1 expression in patients with NSCLC.","Zekun Jiang,Yinping Dong,Zekun Jiang,Longbin Yang,Yinjun Dong,Linke Yang,Yunhong Lv,Shuai Dong,Yunhong Lv,Shuanghu Yuan,Shuai Dong,Shuanghu Yuan,Dengwang Li,Dengwang Li,Li-Heng Liu,Liheng Liu,Dengwang Li,Liheng Liu",Journal of Digital Imaging,2021.0

METHODS A total of 197 pathologically proven renal tumors were divided into ccRCC(n=143) and non-ccRCC (n=54) groups. The 43 non-texture features and 296 texture features that extracted from the 3D volume tumor tissue were assessed for each tumor at both Non-contrast Phase, NCP; Corticomedullary Phase, CMP; Nephrographic Phase, NP and Excretory Phase, EP. Texture-score were calculated by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to screen the most valuable texture features. Model 1 contains the three most distinctive non-texture features with p<0.001, Model 2 contains texture scores, and Model 3 contains the above two types of features. RESULTS The three models shown good discrimination of the ccRCC from non-ccRCC in NCP, CMP, NP, and EP. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)values of the Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3 in differentiating the two groups were 0.748-0.823, 0.776-0.887 and 0.864-0.900, respectively. The difference in AUC between every two of the three Models was statistically significant (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The predictive efficacy of ccRCC was significantly improved by combining non-texture features and texture features to construct a combined diagnostic model, which could provide a reliable basis for clinical treatment options.","Menglin Chen,Fang‐Fang Yin,Menglin Chen,Yuanmeng Yu,Fu Yin,Yuanmeng Yu,Haijie Zhang,Ge Wen,Gen Wen,Haijie Zhang,Haijie Zhang,Ge Wen",Cancer Imaging,2021.0
10.1016/j.diii.2021.10.004,34690106.0,,Can we use radiomics in ultrasound imaging? Impact of preprocessing on feature repeatability.,"Abstract   Purpose  The purpose of this study was to assess the inter-slice radiomic feature repeatability in ultrasound imaging and the impact of preprocessing using intensity standardization and grey-level discretization to help improve radiomics reproducibility.    Materials and methods  This single-center study enrolled consecutive patients with an orbital lesion who underwent ultrasound examination of the orbit from December 2015 to July 2019. Two images per lesion were randomly assigned to two subsets. Radiomic features were extracted and inter-slice repeatability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the subsets. The impact of preprocessing on feature repeatability was assessed using image intensity standardization with or without outliers removal on whole images, bounding boxes or regions of interest (ROI), and fixed bin size or fixed bin number grey-level discretization. Number of inter-slice repeatable features (ICC ≥0.7) between methods was compared.    Results  Eighty-eight patients (37 men, 51 women) with a mean age of 51.5±17 (SD) years (range: 20–88 years) were enrolled. Without preprocessing, 29/101 features (28.7%) were repeatable between slices. The greatest number of repeatable features (41/101) was obtained using intensity standardization with outliers removal on the ROI and fixed bin size discretization. Standardization performed better with outliers removal than without (P    Conclusion  Radiomic features extracted from ultrasound images are impacted by the slice and preprocessing. The use of intensity standardization with outliers removal applied to the ROI and a fixed bin size grey-level discretization may improve feature repeatability.","Loïc Duron,Julien Savatovsky,Loïc Duron,Laure Fournier,Julien Savatovsky,Augustin Lecler,Laure Fournier,Augustin Lecler",Diagnostic and interventional imaging,2021.0
10.3389/fonc.2021.744460,,,Classification of MR-Detected Additional Lesions in Patients With Breast Cancer Using a Combination of Radiomics Analysis and Machine Learning,"Objective: To investigate the feasibility of using radiomics analysis (RA) with machine learning algorithms based on breast magnetic resonance (MR) images for discriminating malignant from benign MR-detected additional lesions in patients with primary breast cancer. Materials and methods: 174 MR-detected additional lesions (benign, n = 86; malignancy, n = 88) from 158 patients with ipsilateral primary breast cancer from a tertiary medical center were included in this retrospective study. The entire data was randomly split to training (80%) and independent test set (20%). In addition, 25 patients (benign, n = 21; malignancy, n = 15) from another tertiary medical center were included for external test. Radiomics features that were extracted from three regions-of-interest (ROIs; intratumor, peritumor, combined) using fat-saturated T1-weighted images obtained by subtracting pre- from post-contrast images (SUB) and T2-weighted image (T2) were utilized to train support vector machine for the binary classification. A decision tree method was utilized to build a classifier model using clinical imaging interpretation (CII) features assessed by radiologists. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to compare the diagnostic performance. Results: The RA models trained using radiomics features from the intratumor-ROI showed comparable performance to the CII model (accuracy, AUROC; 73.3%, 69.6% for SUB RA model; 70.0%, 75.1% for T2 RA model; 73.3%, 72.0% for CII model). The diagnostic performance increased when the radiomics and CII features were combined to build a fusion model. The fusion model that combines the CII features and radiomics features from multiparametric MRI data demonstrated the highest performance with an accuracy of 86.7% and an AUROC of 91.1%. The external test showed a similar pattern where the fusion models demonstrated higher levels of performance compared to RA- or CII-only models. The accuracy and AUROC of the SUB+T2 RA+CII model in the external test were 80.6% and 91.4%, respectively. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the feasibility of using RA with machine learning approach based on multiparametric MRI for quantitatively characterizing MR-detected additional lesions. The fusion model demonstrated an improved diagnostic performance over the models trained with either RA or CII alone.","Hyo-Jae Lee,Hyo-Jae Lee,Anh-Tien Nguyen,Anh-Tien Nguyen,So Yeon Ki,Jong Eun Lee,So Yeon Ki,Luu-Ngoc Do,Jong Eun Lee,Min Ho Park,Luu-Ngoc Do,Min Ho Park,Ji Shin Lee,Hye Jung Kim,Ji Shin Lee,Hye Jung Kim,Ilwoo Park,Ilwoo Park,Hyo Soon Lim,Hyo Soon Lim",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0

Non-clinical imaging variables, such as reconstruction kernels, have shown to significantly impact radiomics features. In this study, we retrain an open-source convolutional neural network (CNN) to harmonize computerized tomography (CT) images with various reconstruction kernels to improve feature reproducibility and radiomic model performance using epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation prediction in lung cancer as a paradigm. In the training phase, the CNN was retrained and tested on 32 lung cancer patients’ CT images between two different groups of reconstruction kernels (smooth and sharp). In the validation phase, the retrained CNN was validated on an external cohort of 223 lung cancer patients’ CT images acquired using different CT scanners and kernels. The results showed that the retrained CNN could be successfully applied to external datasets with different CT scanner parameters, and harmonization of reconstruction kernels from sharp to smooth could significantly improve the performance of radiomics model in predicting EGFR mutation status in lung cancer. In conclusion, the CNN based method showed great potential in improving feature reproducibility and generalizability by harmonizing medical images with heterogeneous reconstruction kernels.","Jin H Yoon,Jin hwan Yoon,Shawn H Sun,Shen-Su Sun,Manjun Xiao,Manjun Xiao,Hao Yang,Hao Yang,Lin Lu,Liwu Lin,Yajun Li,Yajun Li,Lawrence H.

10.3389/fonc.2021.732196,,,Current Advances and Challenges in Radiomics of Brain Tumors,"Imaging diagnosis is crucial for early detection and monitoring of brain tumors. Radiomics refer to extracting large mass of quantitative features from complex clinical imaging arrays, then transforming them into high-dimensional data which can subsequently be mined to find their relevance with tumor's histological features, progression, grade, or even overall survival. Radiogenomics are to combine radiology with genomic to detect the correlations between gene expression and radiomic features. Compared to traditional brain imaging, radiomics provide quantitative information linked to meaningful biologic characteristics and application of deep learning in which shed light on full automation of imaging diagnosis. Recent studies have shown radiomics’ application is broad in identifying primary tumor, differential diagnosis, grading, evaluation of mutation status and aggression, prediction of treatment response and recurrence in pituitary tumors, gliomas and brain metastases. Besides clinical applications, we further discuss the current limitations along with future development of radiomics along with deep learning.","Zhenjie Yi,Lifu Long,Zhenjie Yi,Yu Zeng,Lifu Long,Yu Zeng,Yu Zeng,Zhixiong Liu,Zhixiong Liu",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0

Methods We enrolled 143 patients (71 GBM and 72 BM) in a retrospective bicentric study from January 2010 to May 2019 to train the classifier. Post-contrast 3DT1 MR images were performed on a 3-Tesla MR unit and 100 radiomic features were extracted. Selection and optimization of the Machine Learning (ML) classifier was performed using a nested cross-validation. Sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated as performance metrics. The model final performance was cross-validated, then evaluated on a test set of 37 patients, and compared to human blind reading using a McNemar's test. Results The ML classifier had a mean [95% confidence interval] sensitivity of 85% [77; 94], a specificity of 87% [78; 97], a balanced accuracy of 86% [80; 92], and an AUC of 92% [87; 97] with cross-validation. Sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy and AUC were equal to75, 86, 80 and 85% on the test set. Sphericity 3D radiomic index highlighted the highest coefficient in the logistic regression model. There were no statistical significant differences observed between the performance of the classifier and the experts' blinded examination. Conclusions The proposed diagnostic support system based on radiomic features extracted from post-contrast 3DT1 MR images helps in differentiating solitary BM from GBM with high diagnosis performance and generalizability.","Alix de Causans,Alexandre Carré,Alix de Causans,Alexandre Roux,Alexandre Carré,Alexandre Roux,Arnault Tauziède‐Espariat,Alexandre Roux,Arnault Tauziède-Espariat,Samy Ammari,Samy Ammari,Edouard Dezamis,Edouard Dezamis,Frédéric Dhermain,Frédéric Dhermain,F.

10.1371/journal.pone.0253419,34143830.0,,Effect of grey-level discretization on texture feature on different weighted MRI images of diverse disease groups.,"PURPOSE Many studies of MRI radiomics do not include the discretization method used for the analyses, which might indicate that the discretization methods used are considered irrelevant. Our goals were to compare three frequently used discretization methods (lesion relative resampling (LRR), lesion absolute resampling (LAR) and absolute resampling (AR)) applied to the same data set, along with two different lesion segmentation approaches. METHODS We analyzed the effects of altering bin widths or bin numbers for the three different sampling methods using 40 texture indices (TIs). The impact was evaluated on brain MRI studies obtained for 71 patients divided into three different disease groups: multiple sclerosis (MS, N = 22), ischemic stroke (IS, N = 22), cancer patients (N = 27). Two different MRI acquisition protocols were considered for all patients, a T2- and a post-contrast 3D T1-weighted MRI sequence. Elliptical and manually drawn VOIs were employed for both imaging series. Three different types of gray-level discretization methods were used: LRR, LAR and AR. Hypothesis tests were done among all diseased and control areas to compare the TI values in these areas. We also did correlation analyses between TI values and lesion volumes. RESULTS In general, no significant differences were reported in the results when employing the AR and LAR discretization methods. It was found that employing 38 TIs introduced variation in the results when the number of bin parameters was altered, suggesting that both the degree and direction of monotonicity between each TI value and binning parameters were characteristic for each TI. Furthermore, while TIs were changing with altering binning values, no changes correlated to neither disease nor the MRI sequence. We found that most indices correlated weakly with the volume, while the correlation coefficients were independent of both diseases analyzed and MR contrast. Several cooccurrence-matrix based texture parameters show a definite higher correlation when employing the LRR discretization method However, with the best correlations obtained for the manually drawn VOI. Hypothesis tests among all disease and control areas (co-lateral hemisphere) revealed that the AR or LAR discretization techniques provide more suitable texture features than LRR. In addition, the manually drawn segmentation gave fewer significantly different TIs than the ellipsoid segmentations. In addition, the amount of TIs with significant differences was increasing with increasing the number of bins, or decreasing bin widths. CONCLUSION Our findings indicate that the AR discretization method may offer the best texture analysis in MR image assessments. Employing too many bins or too large bin widths might reduce the selection of TIs that can be used for differential diagnosis. In general, more statistically different TIs were observed for elliptical segmentations when compared to the manually drawn VOIs. In the texture analysis of MR studies, studies and publications should report on all important parameters and methods related to data collection, corrections, normalization, discretization, and segmentation.","G.

10.4103/jmp.jmp_6_21,,,Framework for machine learning of ct and pet radiomics to predict local failure after radiotherapy in locally advanced head and neck cancers,"Context: Cancer Radiomics is an emerging field in medical imaging and refers to the process of converting routine radiological images that are typically qualitatively interpreted to quantifiable descriptions of the tumor phenotypes and when combined with statistical analytics can improve the accuracy of clinical outcome prediction models. However, to understand the radiomic features and their correlation to molecular changes in the tumor, first, there is a need for the development of robust image analysis methods, software tools and statistical prediction models which is often limited in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Aims: The aim is to build a framework for machine learning of radiomic features of planning computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) using open source radiomics and data analytics platforms to make it widely accessible to clinical groups. The framework is tested in a small cohort to predict local disease failure following radiation treatment for head-and-neck cancer (HNC). The predictors were also compared with the existing Aerts HNC radiomics signature. Settings and Design: Retrospective analysis of patients with locally advanced HNC between 2017 and 2018 and 31 patients with both pre- and post-radiation CT and evaluation PET were selected. Subjects and Methods: Tumor volumes were delineated on baseline PET using the semi-automatic adaptive-threshold algorithm and propagated to CT; PyRadiomics features (total of 110 under shape/intensity/texture classes) were extracted. Two feature-selection methods were tested for model stability. Models were built based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-logistic and Ridge regression of the top pretreatment radiomic features and compared to Aerts' HNC-signature. Average model performance across all internal validation test folds was summarized by the area under the receiver operator curve (ROC). Results: Both feature selection methods selected CT features MCC (GLCM), SumEntropy (GLCM) and Sphericity (Shape) that could predict the binary failure status in the cross-validated group and achieved an AUC >0.7. However, models using Aerts' signature features (Energy, Compactness, GLRLM-GrayLevelNonUniformity and GrayLevelNonUniformity-HLH wavelet) could not achieve a clear separation between outcomes (AUC = 0.51–0.54). Conclusions: Radiomics pipeline included open-source workflows which makes it adoptable in LMIC countries. Additional independent validation of data is crucial for the implementation of radiomic models for clinical risk stratification.","Devakumar Devadhas,Devadhas Devakumar,Goutham Sunny,Balu Krishna Sasidharan,Goutham Sunny,Stephen R.

Four readers included for segmentation are: a data scientist (BY), a medical student (LS), a radiology trainee (MH), and a specialty-trained radiologist (SK) for a total of 293 patients from two publicly available databases. Sorensen–Dice (SD) coefficients and low rank Pearson correlation coefficients (CC) of 429 radiomics were calculated to assess interobserver variability. Cox proportional hazard (CPH) models and Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves of overall survival (OS) prediction for each dataset were also generated. SD and CC for segmentations demonstrated high similarities, yielding, SD: 0.79 and CC: 0.92 (BY-SK), SD: 0.81 and CC: 0.83 (LS-SK), and SD: 0.84 and CC: 0.91 (MH-SK) in average for both databases, respectively. OS through the maximal CPH model for the two datasets yielded c-statistics of 0.7 (95% CI) and 0.69 (95% CI), while adding radiomic and clinical variables (sex, stage/morphological status, and histology) together. KM curves also showed significant discrimination between high- and low-risk patients (p-value < 0.005). This supports that readers’ level of training and clinical experience may not significantly influence the ability to extract accurate radiomic features for NSCLC on CT. This potentially allows flexibility in the training required to produce robust prognostic imaging biomarkers for potential clinical translation.","Michelle Hershman,Michelle Hershman,Bardia Yousefi,Lacey Serletti,Bardia Yousefi,Maya Galperin-Aizenberg,Lacey Serletti,Maya Galperin-Aizenberg,Leonid Roshkovan,Leonid Roshkovan,José Marcio Luna,Jeffrey C.

10.21203/rs.3.rs-758924/v1,,,MRI Radiomics to Differentiate Between Low Grade Glioma and Glioblastoma Peritumoral Region,"BACKGROUND The peritumoral region (PTR) of glioblastoma (GBM) appears as a T2W-hyperintensity and is composed of microscopic tumor and edema. Infiltrative low grade glioma (LGG) comprises tumor cells that seem similar to GBM PTR on MRI. The work here explored if a radiomics-based approach can distinguish between the two groups (tumor and edema versus tumor alone). METHODS Patients with GBM and LGG imaged using a 1.5T MRI were included in the study. Image data from cases of GBM PTR, and LGG were manually segmented guided by T2W hyperintensity. A set of 91 first-order and texture features were determined from each of T1W-contrast, and T2W-FLAIR, diffusion-weighted imaging sequences. Applying filtration techniques, a total of 3822 features were obtained. Different feature reduction techniques were employed, and a subsequent model was constructed using four machine learning classifiers. Leave-one-out cross-validation was used to assess classifier performance. RESULTS The analysis included 42 GBM and 36 LGG. The best performance was obtained using AdaBoost classifier using all the features with a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area of curve (AUC) of 91%, 86%, 89%, and 0.96, respectively. Amongst the feature selection techniques, the recursive feature elimination technique had the best results, with an AUC ranging from 0.87 to 0.92. Evaluation with the F-test resulted in the most consistent feature selection with 3 T1W-contrast texture features chosen in over 90% of instances. CONCLUSIONS Quantitative analysis of conventional MRI sequences can effectively demarcate GBM PTR from LGG, which is otherwise indistinguishable on visual estimation.","Nauman Malik,Benjamin Geraghty,Nauman Malik,Nauman Malik,Benjamin J.

Methods  We analyzed radiomic features from MRI in 60 women with FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage IB2-IVA cervical cancer who underwent definitive CCRT 45-50.4 Gy (in 25-28 fractions). Thirty-nine (65.0%) received EBRT sequential boost (4-20 Gy) on primary tumor site and 56 (93.3%) received high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost (6-28 Gy) (daily fractions of 5-7 Gy). Moreover, 71.7% of patients received dose-dense neoadjuvant chemotherapy for 6 cycles. The gross tumor volume was defined on T2-weighted sequences and 29 features were extracted from each MRI performed before and after CCRT, using dedicated software, and their prognostic value was correlated with clinical information.  Results  In univariate analysis, age ⩾60 years and FIGO stage IB2-IIB had significantly better progression-free survival (PFS) (p = 0.022 and p = 0.009, respectively). There was a trend for significance for worse overall survival (OS) in patients with positive nodes (p = 0.062). In multivariate analysis, only age ⩾60 years and FIGO stage IB2-IIB reached significantly better PFS (p = 0.020 and p = 0.053, respectively).

Methods  We retrospectively analyzed 317 patients with rectal cancer. Of these, 114 were EMVI positive and 203 were EMVI negative. Radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging, T1-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and enhanced T1-weighted imaging of rectal cancer, followed by the dimension reduction of the features. Logistic regression, support vector machine, Bayes, K-nearest neighbor, and random forests algorithms were trained to obtain the radiomics signatures. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the performance of each radiomics signature. The best radiomics signature was selected and combined with clinical and radiological characteristics to construct a joint model for predicting EMVI. Finally, the predictive performance of the joint model was assessed.  Results  The Bayes-based radiomics signature performed well in both the training set and the test set, with the AUCs of 0.744 and 0.738, sensitivities of 0.754 and 0.728, and specificities of 0.887 and 0.918, respectively.

Conclusions  The joint model demonstrated the best diagnostic performance for the preoperative prediction of EMVI in patients with rectal cancer. Hence, it can be used as a key tool for clinical individualized EMVI prediction.

This study utilized radiomics, which produced advanced objective and quantitative indicators, and machine learning to develop, validate, test, and compare models for predicting the postoperative prognosis of CSM. Materials and methods In total, 151 CSM patients undergoing surgical treatment and preoperative MRI was retrospectively collected and divided into good/poor outcome groups based on postoperative modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) scores. The datasets obtained from several scanners (an independent scanner) for the training (testing) cohort were used for cross-validation (CV). Radiological models based on the intramedullary hyperintensity and compression ratio were constructed with 14 binary classifiers. Radiomic models based on 237 robust radiomic features were constructed with the same 14 binary classifiers in combination with 7 feature reduction methods, resulting in 98 models. The main outcome measures were the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and accuracy. Results Forty-one (11) radiomic models were superior to random guessing during CV (testing), with significant increased AUROC and/or accuracy (PAUROC < .05 and/or Paccuracy < .05). One radiological model performed better than random guessing during CV (Paccuracy < .05). In the testing cohort, the linear SVM preprocessor + SVM, the best radiomic model (AUROC: 0.74 ± 0.08, accuracy: 0.73 ± 0.07), overperformed the best radiological model (PAUROC = .048).

METHODS One hundred patients (median age, 69years; range, 19-94years) who received CT scans of the thoracolumbar spine and blood-testing for hemoglobin and hematocrit levels±24h between 08/2018 and 11/2019 were retrospectively included. Intraaortic blood was segmented using a spherical volume of interest of 1cm diameter with consecutive radiomic analysis applying PyRadiomics software. Feature selection was performed applying analysis of correlation and collinearity. The final feature set was obtained to differentiate moderate-to-severe anemia. Random forest machine learning was applied and predictive performance was assessed. A decision-tree was obtained to propose a cut-off value of CT Hounsfield units (HU). RESULTS High correlation with hemoglobin and hematocrit levels was shown for first-order radiomic features (p<0.001 to p=0.032). The top 3 features showed high correlation to hemoglobin values (p) and minimal collinearity (r) to the top ranked feature Median (p<0.001), Energy (p=0.002, r=0.387), Minimum (p=0.032, r=0.437). Median (p<0.001) and Minimum (p=0.003) differed in moderate-to-severe anemia compared to non-anemic state. Median yielded superiority to the combination of Median and Minimum (p(AUC)=0.015, p(precision)=0.017, p(accuracy)=0.612) in the predictive performance employing random forest analysis. A Median HU value≤36.5 indicated moderate-to-severe anemia (accuracy=0.90, precision=0.80). CONCLUSIONS First-order radiomic features correlate with hemoglobin levels and may be feasible for the prediction of moderate-to-severe anemia. High dimensional radiomic features did not aid augmenting the data in our exemplary use case of intraluminal blood component assessment.

10.3389/fonc.2021.618604,,,Prediction of Clinical Outcome for High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation of Uterine Leiomyomas Using Multiparametric MRI Radiomics-Based Machine Leaning Model.,"Objectives: This study sought to develop a multi-parametric MRI radiomics-based machine learning model for the preoperative prediction of clinical success for high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation of uterine leiomyomas. Methods: One hundred and thirty patients receiving HIFU ablation therapy for uterine leiomyomas were enrolled in this retrospective study. Radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted (T2WI) image and ADC map derived from diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Three feature selection algorithms including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), recursive feature elimination (RFE), and ReliefF algorithm were used to select radiomics features, respectively, which were fed into four machine learning classifiers including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) for the construction of outcome prediction models before HIFU treatment. The performance, predication ability and clinical usefulness of these models were verified and evaluated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC), calibration and decision curve analyses. Results: The radiomics analysis provided an effective preoperative prediction for HIFU ablation of uterine leiomyomas. Using SVM with ReliefF algorithm, the multi-parametric MRI radiomics model showed the favorable performance with average accuracy of 0.849, sensitivity of 0.814, specificity of 0.896, positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.903, negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.823 and the area under an ROC curve (AUC) of 0.887 (95% CI = 0.848–0.939) in 5-fold cross validation, followed by RF with ReliefF. Calibration and decision curve analyses confirmed the potential of model in predication ability and clinical usefulness. Conclusions: The radiomics based machine learning model can predict preoperatively HIFU ablation response for patients with uterine leiomyomas and contribute to determining individual treatment strategies.","Yineng Zheng,Yineng Zheng,Liping Chen,Liping Chen,Mengqi Liu,Jiahui Wu,Mengqi Liu,Yu Rong,Jiahui Wu,Renqiang Yu,Fajin Lv,Fajin Lv",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0

Radiomics-based models are often trained on single-institution datasets; however, multi-centre imaging datasets are preferred for external generalizability owing to the influence of inter-institutional scanning differences and acquisition settings. The study aim was to determine the value of preselection of robust radiomic features in routine clinical positron emission tomography (PET) images to predict clinical outcomes in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Methods  A total of 1404 primary tumour radiomic features were extracted from pre-treatment [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET scans of stage IIIA/N2 or IIIB NSCLC patients using a training cohort (n = 79; prospective Swiss multi-centre randomized phase III trial SAKK 16/00; 16 centres) and an internal validation cohort (n = 31; single centre). Robustness studies investigating delineation variation, attenuation correction and motion were performed (intraclass correlation coefficient threshold > 0.9). Two 12-/24-month event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) logistic regression models were trained using standardized imaging: (1) with robust features alone and (2) with all available features. Models were then validated using fivefold cross-validation, and validation on a separate single-centre dataset. Model performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).  Results  Robustness studies identified 179 stable features (13%), with 25% stable features for 3D versus 4D acquisition, 31% for attenuation correction and 78% for delineation. Univariable analysis found no significant robust features predicting 12-/24-month EFS and 12-month OS (p value > 0.076). Prognostic models without robust preselection performed well for 12-month EFS in training (AUC = 0.73) and validation (AUC = 0.74). Patient stratification into two risk groups based on 12-month EFS was significant for training (p value = 0.02) and validation cohorts (p value = 0.03).  Conclusions  A PET-based radiomics model using a standardized, multi-centre dataset to predict EFS in locally advanced NSCLC was successfully established and validated with good performance. Prediction models with robust feature preselection were unsuccessful, indicating the need for a standardized imaging protocol.","Carol Oliveira,Florian Amstutz,Carol Oliveira,Florian Amstutz,Diem Vuong,Diem Vuong,Marta Bogowicz,Martin W.

Approach: In a retrospective cohort study of 102 CT cases [68 males (67%), 34 females (33%); mean age ± SD, 63±12years ], we pathology-confirmed 42 oncocytomas (41%) and 60 chromophobes (59%). A board-certified radiologist performed two RB rounds. From each RB round, we computed radiomics features and compared the performance of a random forest and AdaBoost binary classifier trained from the features. To control for overfitting, we performed 10 rounds of 70% to 30% train-test splits with feature-selection, cross-validation, and hyperparameter-optimization on each split. We evaluated the performance with test ROC AUC. We tested models on data from the other RB round and compared with the same round testing with the DeLong test. We clustered important features for each round and measured a bootstrapped adjusted Rand index agreement. Results: Our best classifiers achieved an average AUC of 0.71±0.024 . We found no evidence of an effect for RB round ( p=1 ). We also found no evidence for a decrease in model performance when tested on the other RB round ( p=0.85 ). Feature clustering produced seven clusters in each RB round with high agreement ( Rand index=0.981±0.002 , p<0.00001 ). Conclusions: A consistent radiomic signature can be derived from RBs and could help distinguish oncocytoma and chromophobe RCC.","Akshay Jaggi,Domenico Mastrodicasa,Akshay Jaggi,Gregory W.

At present there are no validated biomarkers available for the individualisation of radical radiotherapy in lung cancer and the mortality rate of this disease remains the highest of all other solid tumours. MEDLINE was searched using the terms 'radiomics' and 'lung cancer' according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Met-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance. Radiomics studies were defined as those manuscripts describing the extraction and analysis of at least 10 quantifiable imaging features. Only those studies assessing disease control, survival or toxicity outcomes for patients with lung cancer following radical radiotherapy ± chemotherapy were included. Study titles and abstracts were reviewed by two independent reviewers. The Radiomics Quality Score was applied to the full text of included papers. Of 244 returned results, 44 studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. End points frequently reported were local (17%), regional (17%) and distant control (31%), overall survival (79%) and pulmonary toxicity (4%). Imaging features strongly associated with clinical outcomes include texture features belonging to the subclasses Gray level run length matrix, Gray level co-occurrence matrix and kurtosis. The median cohort size for model development was 100 (15-645); in the 11 studies with external validation in a separate independent population, the median cohort size was 84 (21-295). The median number of imaging features extracted was 184 (10-6538). The median Radiomics Quality Score was 11% (0-47). Patient-reported outcomes were not incorporated within any studies identified. No studies externally validated a radiomics signature in a registered prospective study. Imaging-derived indices attained through radiomic analyses could equip thoracic oncologists with biomarkers for treatment response, patterns of failure, normal tissue toxicity and survival in lung cancer. Based on routine scans, their non-invasive nature and cost-effectiveness are major advantages over conventional pathological assessment. Improved tools are required for the appraisal of radiomics studies, as significant barriers to clinical implementation remain, such as standardisation of input scan data, quality of reporting and external validation of signatures in randomised, interventional clinical trials.","Gerard Walls,Sarah Osman,Gerard Walls,S.O.S.

Radiomics features extracted from FET PET images may be sensitive to variations when imaging at multiple time points. It is therefore necessary to assess feature robustness to test-retest imaging.Eight patients with histologically confirmed GBM that had undergone post-surgical test-retest FET PET imaging were recruited. In total, 1578 radiomic features were extracted from biological tumour volumes (BTVs) delineated using a semi-automatic contouring method. Feature repeatability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The effect of both bin width and filter choice on feature repeatability was also investigated.59/106 (55.7%) features from the original image and 843/1472 (57.3%) features from filtered images had an ICC ≥ 0.85. Shape and first order features were most stable. Choice of bin width showed minimal impact on features defined as stable. The Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG, σ=5 mm) and Wavelet filters (HLL and LHL) significantly improved feature repeatability (p ≪ 0.0001, p=0.003, p=0.002, respectively). Correlation of textural features with tumour volume was reported for transparency.FET PET radiomic features extracted from post-surgical images of GBM patients that are robust to test-retest imaging were identified. An investigation with a larger dataset is warranted to validate the findings in this study.","Nathaniel Barry,Nathaniel Barry,Pejman Rowshanfarzad,Pejman Rowshanfarzad,Roslyn J. Francis,Anna K.

Computational ""radiomic"" techniques extract biomarker information from images which can be used to improve diagnosis and predict tumour biology. AIMS To perform a systematic review on radiomic features in HCC diagnosis and prognosis, with a focus on reporting metrics and methodologic standardisation. METHODS We performed a systematic review of all full-text articles published from inception through December 1, 2019. Standardised data extraction and quality assessment metrics were applied to all studies. RESULTS A total of 54 studies were included for analysis. Radiomic features demonstrated good discriminatory performance to differentiate HCC from other solid lesions (c-statistics 0.66-0.95), and to predict microvascular invasion (c-statistic 0.76-0.92), early recurrence after hepatectomy (c-statistics 0.71-0.86), and prognosis after locoregional or systemic therapies (c-statistics 0.74-0.81). Common stratifying features for diagnostic and prognostic radiomic tools included analyses of imaging skewness, analysis of the peritumoural region, and feature extraction from the arterial imaging phase. The overall quality of the included studies was low, with common deficiencies in both internal and external validation, standardised imaging segmentation, and lack of comparison to a gold standard. CONCLUSIONS Quantitative image analysis demonstrates promise as a non-invasive biomarker to improve HCC diagnosis and management. However, standardisation of protocols and outcome measurement, sharing of algorithms and analytic methods, and external validation are necessary prior to widespread application of radiomics to HCC diagnosis and prognosis in clinical practice.","Emily Harding-Theobald,Emily Harding-Theobald,Jeremy Louissaint,Jeremy Louissaint,Bharat Maraj,Bharat Maraj,Edward Cuaresma,Edward Cuaresma,Whitney Townsend,Mishal Mendiratta‐Lala,Whitney Townsend,Amit G.

METHODS AND MATERIALS One hundred twenty-eight OPSCC patients with known HPV status (60-HPV+ and 68-HPV-, confirmed by immunohistochemistry-P16 protein testing) were retrospectively studied. A 3D Discrete Fourier Transform was applied on contrast-enhanced CT images of patient gross tumor volumes (GTV's) to transform intensity distributions to the frequency domain and estimate frequency power spectrums of HPV- and HPV+ patient cohorts. Statistical analyses were performed to rank frequency bands contributing towards prediction of HPV status. An outcome-driven frequency filter was designed accordingly and applied to GTV frequency information. 3D Inverse-Discrete-Fourier-Transform was applied to reconstruct HPV-related frequency-filtered images. Radiomics features (11 feature-categories) were extracted from pre- and post- frequency filtered images using our previously published 'ROdiomiX' software. Least-Absolute-Shrinkage-and-Selection-Operation (Lasso) combined with a Generalized-Linear-Model (Lasso-GLM) was developed to identify and rank feature subsets with optimal information for prediction of HPV+/-. Radiomics-based Lasso-GLM classifiers (pre- and post-frequency filtered) were constructed and validated using a random permutation sampling and nested cross-validation techniques. Average Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC), and Positive and Negative Predictive values (PPV, NPV) were computed to estimate generalization error and prediction performance. RESULTS Among 192 radiomic features, 15 features were found to be statistically significant discriminators between HPV+/- cohorts on post-frequency filtered CE-CT images; 14 such radiomic features were observed on pre-frequency filtered datasets. Discriminant features included tumor morphology and intensity contrast. Performances for prediction of HPV for the pre- and post-frequency filtered Lasso-GLM classifiers were: AUC/PPV/NPV = 0.789/0.755/0.805 and 0.850/0.808/0.877 respectively. Nested-CV performances for prediction of HPV for the pre- and post-frequency filtered Lasso-GLM classifiers were: AUC/PPV/NPV = 0.814/0.725/0.877 and 0.890/0.820/0.911 respectively.

However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed before translation to clinical use. This study presents an ad-hoc weighted statistical framework to explore radiomic biomarkers for a better characterization of the radiogenomic phenotypes in breast cancer. Thirty-six female patients with breast cancer were enrolled in this study. Radiomic features were extracted from MRI and PET imaging techniques for malignant and healthy lesions in each patient. To reduce within-subject bias, the ratio of radiomic features extracted from both lesions was calculated for each patient. Radiomic features were further normalized, comparing the z-score, quantile, and whitening normalization methods to reduce between-subjects bias. After feature reduction by Spearman’s correlation, a methodological approach based on a principal component analysis (PCA) was applied. The results were compared and validated on twenty-seven patients to investigate the tumor grade, Ki-67 index, and molecular cancer subtypes using classification methods (LogitBoost, random forest, and linear discriminant analysis). The classification techniques achieved high area-under-the-curve values with one PC that was calculated by normalizing the radiomic features via the quantile method.

10.12659/msm.937738,,,A Review of the Role of Ultrasound Radiomics and Its Application and Limitations in the Investigation of Thyroid Disease,"The incidence of thyroid disease has gradually increased in recent years. Conventional ultrasound is one of the most critical thyroid imaging methods, but it still has certain limitations. The use of B-model ultrasound (BMUS) diagnosis of thyroid disease will be affected by a doctors' clinical experience. The ultrasound radiomics is based on ultrasound images to delineate the region of interest (ROI), and then extract features to quantify the disease information contained in the image, which helps to analyze the correlation between the image and the clinical pathology of the disease. By building a powerful model, it can be used to diagnose benign and malignant thyroid nodules, predict lymph node status in thyroid cancer, analyze molecular biological characteristics, and predict the survival of thyroid cancer patients. At present, the application of ultrasound radiomics in the thyroid is pervasive. These ultrasound radiomics studies have further promoted the progress of ultrasonic technology in the field of thyroid disease. Clinicians should be familiar with the workflow of ultrasound radiomics and understand the application of this technology to the thyroid. In this article, we first describe the workflow of ultrasound radiomics, followed by an overview of the application of ultrasound radiomics to the thyroid. Finally, some current limitations of the technology and areas for future improvement are discussed.

10.1186/s42492-022-00106-3,,,Acquisition repeatability of MRI radiomics features in the head and neck: a dual-3D-sequence multi-scan study,"Abstract Radiomics has increasingly been investigated as a potential biomarker in quantitative imaging to facilitate personalized diagnosis and treatment of head and neck cancer (HNC), a group of malignancies associated with high heterogeneity. However, the feature reliability of radiomics is a major obstacle to its broad validity and generality in application to the highly heterogeneous head and neck (HN) tissues. In particular, feature repeatability of radiomics in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition, which is considered a crucial confounding factor of radiomics feature reliability, is still sparsely investigated. This study prospectively investigated the acquisition repeatability of 93 MRI radiomics features in ten HN tissues of 15 healthy volunteers, aiming for potential magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) treatment of HNC. Each subject underwent four MRI acquisitions with MRgRT treatment position and immobilization using two pulse sequences of 3D T1-weighed turbo spin-echo and 3D T2-weighed turbo spin-echo on a 1.5 T MRI simulator. The repeatability of radiomics feature acquisition was evaluated in terms of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), whereas within-subject acquisition variability was evaluated in terms of the coefficient of variation (CV). The results showed that MRI radiomics features exhibited heterogeneous acquisition variability and uncertainty dependent on feature types, tissues, and pulse sequences. Only a small fraction of features showed excellent acquisition repeatability (ICC &gt; 0.9) and low within-subject variability. Multiple MRI scans improved the accuracy and confidence of the identification of reliable features concerning MRI acquisition compared to simple test-retest repeated scans.

10.1186/s13014-022-02048-9,35428267.0,,Applicability of a pathological complete response magnetic resonance-based radiomics model for locally advanced rectal cancer in intercontinental cohort,"Predicting pathological complete response (pCR) in patients affected by locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) who undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is a challenging field of investigation, but many of the published models are burdened by a lack of reliable external validation. Aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomic-based pCR model developed and validated in Europe, to a different cohort of patients from an intercontinental cancer center.The original model was based on two clinical and two radiomics features extracted from T2-weighted 1.5 T MRI of 161 LARC patients acquired before nCRT, considered as training set. Such model is here validated using the T2-w 1.5 and 3 T staging MRI of 59 LARC patients with different clinical characteristics consecutively treated in mainland Chinese cancer center from March 2017 to January 2018. Model performance were evaluated in terms of area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC) and relative parameters, such as accuracy, specificity, negative and positive predictive value (NPV and PPV).An AUC of 0.83 (CI 95%, 0.71-0.96) was achieved for the intercontinental cohort versus a value of 0.75 (CI 95%, 0.61-0.88) at the external validation step reported in the original experience. Considering the best cut-off threshold identified in the first experience (0.26), the following predictive performance were obtained: 0.65 as accuracy, 0.64 as specificity, 0.70 as sensitivity, 0.91 as NPV and 0.28 as PPV.Despite the introduction of significant different factors, the proposed model appeared to be replicable on a real-world data extra-European patients' cohort, achieving a TRIPOD 4 level.","Luca Boldrini,Luca Boldrini,Jacopo Lenkowicz,L.C.

Medical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and spectral imaging can efficiently aid physicians in diagnosing, treating, and evaluating patients with gliomas. With the increasing clinical records and digital images, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) based on medical imaging has reduced the burden on physicians treating gliomas even further. This review will classify AI technologies and procedures used in medical imaging analysis. Additionally, we will discuss the applications of AI in glioma, including tumor segmentation and classification, prediction of genetic markers, and prediction of treatment response and prognosis, using MRI, PET, and spectral imaging. Despite the benefits of AI in clinical applications, several issues such as data management, incomprehension, safety, clinical efficacy evaluation, and ethical or legal considerations, remain to be solved. In the future, doctors and researchers should collaborate to solve these issues, with a particular emphasis on interdisciplinary teamwork.","Jiaona Xu,Jiaona Xu,Yuting Meng,Yuting Meng,Kefan Qiu,Kefan Qiu,Win Topatana,Win Topatana,Shijie Li,Shijie Li,Chao Wei,Chao Wei,Tianwen Chen,Tianwen Chen,Tianwen Chen,Mingyu Chen,Mingyu Chen,Zhongxiang Ding,Zhongxiang Ding,Guozhong Niu,Guozhong Niu",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0

Imaging plays an essential role in each phase of lung cancer management, from detection to assessment of response to treatment. The development of imaging-based artificial intelligence (AI) models has the potential to play a key role in early detection and customized treatment planning. Computer-aided detection of lung nodules in screening programs has revolutionized the early detection of the disease. Moreover, the possibility to use AI approaches to identify patients at risk of developing lung cancer during their life can help a more targeted screening program. The combination of imaging features and clinical and laboratory data through AI models is giving promising results in the prediction of patients’ outcomes, response to specific therapies, and risk for toxic reaction development. In this review, we provide an overview of the main imaging AI-based tools in lung cancer imaging, including automated lesion detection, characterization, segmentation, prediction of outcome, and treatment response to provide radiologists and clinicians with the foundation for these applications in a clinical scenario.","Michaela Cellina,Michaela Cellina,Maurizio CÈ,Maurizio Cè,Giovanni Irmici,Giovanni Irmici,Velio Ascenti,Velio Ascenti,Natallia Khenkina,Natallia Khenkina,Marco Toto-Brocchi,Marco Toto-Brocchi,C Martinenghi,Carlo Martinenghi,Sergio Papa,Sergio Papa,Gianpaolo Carrafiello,Gianpaolo Carrafiello",Diagnostics,2022.0

As machine learning advances, artificial intelligence(AI) models show promise in diagnosing COVID-19 and other pneumonias. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy and methodological quality of the models.We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase, preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv to locate studies published before December 2021, with no language restrictions. And a quality assessment (QUADAS-2), Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) tools and CLAIM checklist were used to assess the quality of each study. We used random-effects models to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity, I2 values to assess heterogeneity, and Deeks' test to assess publication bias.We screened 32 studies from the 2001 retrieved articles for inclusion in the meta-analysis. We included 6737 participants in the test or validation group. The meta-analysis revealed that AI models based on chest imaging distinguishes COVID-19 from other pneumonias: pooled area under the curve (AUC) 0.96 (95 % CI, 0.94-0.98), sensitivity 0.92 (95 % CI, 0.88-0.94), pooled specificity 0.91 (95 % CI, 0.87-0.93). The average RQS score of 13 studies using radiomics was 7.8, accounting for 22 % of the total score. The 19 studies using deep learning methods had an average CLAIM score of 20, slightly less than half (48.24 %) the ideal score of 42.00.The AI model for chest imaging could well diagnose COVID-19 and other pneumonias.

Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy were excluded from the study. The maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) and RFs were extracted from PET images for primary tumors. The diagnostic performances of PET parameters in groups of tumor differentiation, stage, and mediastinal lymph node metastasis (MLNM) status were evaluated. The study endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with RFs, SUVmax, and CPFs to find independent predictors of PFS and OS.ResultsA total of 77 patients (5 female, 72 male) were included in the study. SUVmax and GLCM entropy were independently associated with tumor differentiation. The only parameter with significant diagnostic performance for MLNM was GLZLM-SLZGE. Tumor diameter and NGLDM busyness were independently associated with the stage. MLNM and tumor differentiation were found to be independent predictors of PFS.

Materials and Methods A total of 373 patients with AGC receiving neoadjuvant therapies were enrolled from five cohorts. Four cohorts of patients received different regimens of NAC, including three retrospective cohorts (training cohort and internal and external validation cohorts) and a prospective Dragon III cohort (NCT03636893). Another prospective SOXA (apatinib in combination with S-1 and oxaliplatin) cohort received neoadjuvant molecular targeted therapy (ChiCTR-OPC-16010061). All patients underwent computed tomography before treatment, and thereafter, tumor regression grade (TRG) was assessed. The primary tumor was delineated, and 2,452 radiomics features were extracted for each patient. Mutual information and random forest were used for dimensionality reduction and modeling. The performance of the radiomics model to predict TRG under different neoadjuvant therapies was evaluated. Results There were 28 radiomics features selected. The radiomics model showed generalization to predict TRG for AGC patients across different NAC regimens, with areas under the curve (AUCs) (95% interval confidence) of 0.82 (0.76~0.90), 0.77 (0.63~0.91), 0.78 (0.66~0.89), and 0.72 (0.66~0.89) in the four cohorts, with no statistical difference observed (all p &amp;gt; 0.05). However, the radiomics model showed poor predictive value on the SOXA cohort [AUC, 0.50 (0.27~0.73)], which was significantly worse than that in the training cohort (p = 0.010). Conclusion Radiomics is generalizable to predict TRG for AGC patients receiving NAC treatments, which is beneficial to transform appropriate treatment, especially for those insensitive to NAC.","Yong Chen,Yong Chen,Wei Xu,Wei Xu,Yanling Li,Yuan‐Fang Li,Wentao Liu,Wentao Li,Birendra Kumar Sah,Birendra Kumar Sah,Liwei Wang,Lan Wang,Zhihan Xu,Zhihan Xu,Michael Wels,Michael Wels,Yanan Zheng,Yanan Zheng,Min Yan,Min Yan,Huan Zhang,Hong-gang Zhang,Qianchen Ma,Qianchen Ma,Zhenggang Zhu,Zhenggang Zhu,Chen Li,Chen Li",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0

All patients underwent a liver parenchymal biopsy. Magnetic resonance elastography was performed using a 3.0-T scanner. After multislice segmentation of MRE images, 834 radiomic features were analyzed using a commercial program. Radiologic features, such as median and mean values of the regions of interest and variable clinical features, were analyzed. A random forest regressor was used to extract important radiomic, radiological, and clinical features. A random forest classifier model was trained to use these features to classify the fibrosis stage. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was evaluated using a classifier for fibrosis stage diagnosis.The pathological hepatic fibrosis stage was classified as low-grade fibrosis (stages F0-F1, n = 82) or clinically significant fibrosis (stages F2-F4, n = 18). Eight important features were extracted from radiomics analysis, with the 2 most important being wavelet-high high low gray level dependence matrix dependence nonuniformity-normalized and wavelet-high high low gray level dependence matrix dependence entropy. The median value of the multiple small regions of interest was identified as the most important radiologic feature. Platelet count has been identified as an important clinical feature. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the classifier using radiomics was comparable with that of radiologic measures (0.97 ± 0.07 and 0.96 ± 0.06, respectively).Magnetic resonance elastography radiomics analysis provides diagnostic performance comparable with conventional MRE analysis for the assessment of clinically significant hepatic fibrosis in patients with NAFLD.","Ki Choon Sim,Min Ju Kim,Ki Choon Sim,Yong Won Cho,Min Ju Kim,Yongwon Cho,Hyun Jin Kim,Hyun Jin Kim,Beom Jin Park,Beom Jin Park,Deuk Jae Sung,Yeo Eun Han,Deuk Jae Sung,Yeo Eun Han,Na Han,Tae Hyung Kim,Na Yeon Han,Tae Hyung Kim,Yoo Jin Lee,Yoo Jin Lee",Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography,2022.0
10.3389/fonc.2022.975183,,,Diagnostic performance of radiomics in adrenal masses: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objectives (1) To assess the methodological quality and risk of bias of radiomics studies investigating the diagnostic performance in adrenal masses and (2) to determine the potential diagnostic value of radiomics in adrenal tumors by quantitative analysis. Methods PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for eligible literature. Methodological quality and risk of bias in the included studies were assessed by the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) and Radiomics Quality Score (RQS). The diagnostic performance was evaluated by pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC). Spearman’s correlation coefficient and subgroup analysis were used to investigate the cause of heterogeneity. Publication bias was examined using the Deeks’ funnel plot. Results Twenty-eight studies investigating the diagnostic performance of radiomics in adrenal tumors were identified, with a total of 3579 samples. The average RQS was 5.11 (14.2% of total) with an acceptable inter-rater agreement (ICC 0.94, 95% CI 0.93–0.95). The risk of bias was moderate according to the result of QUADAS-2. Nine studies investigating the use of CT-based radiomics in differentiating malignant from benign adrenal tumors were included in the quantitative analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, DOR and AUC with 95% confidence intervals were 0.80 (0.68-0.88), 0.83 (0.73-0.90), 19.06 (7.87-46.19) and 0.88 (0.85–0.91), respectively. There was significant heterogeneity among the included studies but no threshold effect in the meta-analysis. The result of subgroup analysis demonstrated that radiomics based on unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT possessed higher diagnostic performance, and second-order or higher-order features could enhance the diagnostic sensitivity but also increase the false positive rate. No significant difference in diagnostic ability was observed between studies with machine learning and those without. Conclusions The methodological quality and risk of bias of studies investigating the diagnostic performance of radiomics in adrenal tumors should be further improved in the future. CT-based radiomics has the potential benefits in differentiating malignant from benign adrenal tumors. The heterogeneity between the included studies was a major limitation to obtaining more accurate conclusions.

The effect of image pre-processing configurations on these images has been sparsely investigated. Fifteen individuals with definite chronic pancreatitis (an exemplar diffuse disease of the pancreas) and 15 healthy individuals were included in this age- and sex-matched case-control study. MR images of the pancreas were acquired using a single 3T scanner. A total of 93 first-order and second-order texture features of the pancreas were compared between the study groups, by subjecting MR images of the pancreas to 7 image pre-processing configurations related to gray level discretization and image filtration. The studied parameters of intensity discretization did not vary in terms of their effect on the number of significant first-order texture features. The number of statistically significant first-order texture features varied after filtering (7 with the use of logarithm filter and 3 with the use of Laplacian of Gaussian filter with 5 mm σ). Intensity discretization generally affected the number of significant second-order texture features more markedly than filtering. The use of fixed bin number of 16 yielded 42 significant second-order texture features, fixed bin number of 128–38 features, fixed bin width of 6–24 features, and fixed bin width of 42–26 features. The specific parameters of filtration and intensity discretization had differing effects on radiomics signature of the pancreas. Relative discretization with fixed bin number of 16 and use of logarithm filter hold promise as pre-processing configurations of choice in future radiomics studies in diffuse diseases of the pancreas.","Bassam M.

10.1186/s13244-022-01170-2,,,Evaluation of the dependence of radiomic features on the machine learning model,"Abstract Background In radiomic studies, several models are often trained with different combinations of feature selection methods and classifiers. The features of the best model are usually considered relevant to the problem, and they represent potential biomarkers. Features selected from statistically similarly performing models are generally not studied. To understand the degree to which the selected features of these statistically similar models differ, 14 publicly available datasets, 8 feature selection methods, and 8 classifiers were used in this retrospective study. For each combination of feature selection and classifier, a model was trained, and its performance was measured with AUC-ROC. The best-performing model was compared to other models using a DeLong test. Models that were statistically similar were compared in terms of their selected features. Results Approximately 57% of all models analyzed were statistically similar to the best-performing model. Feature selection methods were, in general, relatively unstable (0.58; range 0.35–0.84). The features selected by different models varied largely (0.19; range 0.02–0.42), although the selected features themselves were highly correlated (0.71; range 0.4–0.92). Conclusions Feature relevance in radiomics strongly depends on the model used, and statistically similar models will generally identify different features as relevant. Considering features selected by a single model is misleading, and it is often not possible to directly determine whether such features are candidate biomarkers.","Aydin Demircioglu,Aydın Demircioğlu",Insights Into Imaging,2022.0

Identifying patients at higher risk of recurrence for more intensive surveillance may facilitate the earlier introduction of the next line of treatment. We aimed to use radiotherapy planning CT scans to develop radiomic classification models that predict overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and recurrence two years post-treatment for risk-stratification. A retrospective multi-centre study of &gt;900 patients receiving curative-intent radiotherapy for stage I-III NSCLC was undertaken. Models using radiomic and/or clinical features were developed, compared with 10-fold cross-validation and an external test set, and benchmarked against TNM-stage. Respective validation and test set AUCs (with 95% confidence intervals) for the radiomic-only models were: (1) OS: 0.712 (0.592–0.832) and 0.685 (0.585–0.784), (2) RFS: 0.825 (0.733–0.916) and 0.750 (0.665–0.835), (3) Recurrence: 0.678 (0.554–0.801) and 0.673 (0.577–0.77). For the combined models: (1) OS: 0.702 (0.583–0.822) and 0.683 (0.586–0.78), (2) RFS: 0.805 (0.707–0.903) and 0·755 (0.672–0.838), (3) Recurrence: 0·637 (0.51–0.·765) and 0·738 (0.649–0.826). Kaplan-Meier analyses demonstrate OS and RFS difference of &gt;300 and &gt;400 days respectively between low and high-risk groups. We have developed validated and externally tested radiomic-based prediction models. Such models could be integrated into the routine radiotherapy workflow, thus informing a personalised surveillance strategy at the point of treatment. Our work lays the foundations for future prospective clinical trials for quantitative personalised risk-stratification for surveillance following curative-intent radiotherapy for NSCLC.","Sumeet Hindocha,Sumeet Hindocha,Thomas Charlton,Thomas G.

The proposed algorithm utilizes quantitative information from automated multidimensional assessments of posterior circulation Acute Stroke Prognosis Early CT-Score (pc-ASPECTS) regions. Discriminatory power was compared to predictions based on conventional pc-ASPECTS ratings.We retrospectively analyzed non-contrast CTs and clinical data of 172 pc-stroke patients. 90 days outcome was dichotomized into good and poor using modified Rankin Scale (mRS) cut-offs. Predictive performance was assessed for outcome differentiation at mRS 2, 3, 4 and survival prediction (mRS ≤ 5) using random forest algorithms. Results were compared to conventional pc-ASPECTS and clinical parameters. Models were evaluated in a nested fivefold cross-validation approach.Receiver operating characteristic areas under the curves (ROC-AUCs) of the test sets using conventionally rated pc-ASPECTS reached 0.63 for mRS ≤ 4 to 0.68 for mRS ≤ 5 and 0.73 for mRS ≤ 5 to 0.85 for mRS ≤ 2 if clinical data were considered. Pure imaging-based machine learning classifier ROC-AUCs were lowest for mRS ≤ 4 (0.81) and highest for mRS ≤ 5 (0.87). The combined clinical data and machine learning-based model had the highest predictive performance with ROC-AUCs reaching 0.90 for mRS ≤ 2.Machine learning-based evaluation of pc-ASPECTS regions predicts functional outcome of pc-stroke patients with higher accuracy than conventional assessments. This could optimize triage for additional diagnostics and allocation of best possible medical care and might allow required arrangements of the social environment at an early point of time.","Helge C Kniep,Helge Kniep,Sarah Elsayed,Sarah Elsayed,Jawed Nawabi,Jawed Nawabi,Gabriel Broocks,Gabriel Broocks,Lukas Meyer,Lukas Meyer,Matthias Bechstein,Matthias Bechstein,Noel Van Horn,Noel van Horn,Marios Psychogios,Marios Psychogios,Götz Thomalla,Götz Thomalla,Fabian Flottmann,Fabian Flottmann,André Kemmling,André Kemmling,Susanne Gellißen,Susanne Gellißen,Jens Fiehler,Jens Fiehler,Peter Sporns,Peter B Sporns,Uta Hanning,Uta Hanning",Journal of Neurology,2022.0
10.3389/fonc.2022.974467,36313629.0,,Improving radiomic model reliability using robust features from perturbations for head-and-neck carcinoma,"Using high robust radiomic features in modeling is recommended, yet its impact on radiomic model is unclear. This study evaluated the radiomic model's robustness and generalizability after screening out low-robust features before radiomic modeling. The results were validated with four datasets and two clinically relevant tasks.A total of 1,419 head-and-neck cancer patients' computed tomography images, gross tumor volume segmentation, and clinically relevant outcomes (distant metastasis and local-regional recurrence) were collected from four publicly available datasets. The perturbation method was implemented to simulate images, and the radiomic feature robustness was quantified using intra-class correlation of coefficient (ICC). Three radiomic models were built using all features (ICC > 0), good-robust features (ICC > 0.75), and excellent-robust features (ICC > 0.95), respectively. A filter-based feature selection and Ridge classification method were used to construct the radiomic models. Model performance was assessed with both robustness and generalizability. The robustness of the model was evaluated by the ICC, and the generalizability of the model was quantified by the train-test difference of Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC).The average model robustness ICC improved significantly from 0.65 to 0.78 (P< 0.0001) using good-robust features and to 0.91 (P< 0.0001) using excellent-robust features. Model generalizability also showed a substantial increase, as a closer gap between training and testing AUC was observed where the mean train-test AUC difference was reduced from 0.21 to 0.18 (P< 0.001) in good-robust features and to 0.12 (P< 0.0001) in excellent-robust features. Furthermore, good-robust features yielded the best average AUC in the unseen datasets of 0.58 (P< 0.001) over four datasets and clinical outcomes.Including robust only features in radiomic modeling significantly improves model robustness and generalizability in unseen datasets. Yet, the robustness of radiomic model has to be verified despite building with robust radiomic features, and tightly restricted feature robustness may prevent the optimal model performance in the unseen dataset as it may lower the discrimination power of the model.","Xinzhi Teng,Xinzhi Teng,Jiang Zhang,Jiang Zhang,Zongrui Ma,Zongrui Ma,Yuanpeng Zhang,Yuanpeng Zhang,Saikit Lam,Saikit Lam,Wen Li,Wen Li,Haonan Xiao,Haonan Xiao,Tian Li,Tian Li,Bing Li,Bing Li,Ta Zhou,Zhou Ta,Ge Ren,Ge Ren,Francis Kar-ho Lee,Francis Kar-ho Lee,Kwok-hung Au,Kwok‐Hung Au,Victor Ho-fun Lee,Victor Ho-fun Lee,Amy Tien Yee Chang,Artemis Chang,Jing Cai,Jing Cai",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0

Methods In a cooperative effort between the EANM and SNMMI, we agreed upon current best practices and recommendations for relevant aspects of radiomics analyses, including study design, quality assurance, data collection, impact of acquisition and reconstruction, detection and segmentation, feature standardization and implementation, as well as appropriate modelling schemes, model evaluation, and interpretation. We also offer an outlook for future perspectives. Conclusion Radiomics is a very quickly evolving field of research. The present guideline focused on established findings as well as recommendations based on the state of the art. Though this guideline recognizes both hand-crafted and deep learning-based radiomics approaches, it primarily focuses on the former as this field is more mature. This guideline will be updated once more studies and results have contributed to improved consensus regarding the application of deep learning methods for radiomics. Although methodological recommendations in the present document are valid for most medical image modalities, we focus here on nuclear medicine, and specific recommendations when necessary are made for PET/CT, PET/MR, and quantitative SPECT.","Mathieu Hatt,M Hatt,A.

10.1155/2022/2056837,,,Machine Learning-Based Radiomics for Prediction of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations in Lung Adenocarcinoma,"Identifying an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation is important because EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the first-line treatment of choice for patients with EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinomas (LUAC). This study is aimed at developing and validating a radiomics-based machine learning (ML) approach to identify EGFR mutations in patients with LUAC. We retrospectively collected data from 201 patients with positive EGFR mutation LUAC (140 in the training cohort and 61 in the validation cohort). We extracted 1316 radiomics features from preprocessed CT images and selected 14 radiomics features and 1 clinical feature which were most relevant to mutations through filter method. Subsequently, we built models using 7 ML approaches and established the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to assess the discriminating performance of these models. In terms of predicting EGFR mutation, the model derived from radiomics features and combined models (radiomics features and relevant clinical factors) had an AUC of 0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.77-0.82), 0.86 (0.87-0.88), respectively. Our study offers a radiomics-based ML model using filter methods to detect the EGFR mutation in patients with LUAC. This convenient and low-cost method may be of help to noninvasively identify patients before obtaining tumor sample for molecule testing.","Jiameng Lu,Jiameng Lu,Xiaoqing Ji,Xiaoqing Ji,Lixia Wang,Lixia Wang,Yunxiu Jiang,Yunxiu Jiang,Xinyi Liu,Zhenshen Ma,Xinyi Liu,Zhenshen Ma,Yafei Ning,Dong Jie,Yafei Ning,Jie Dong,Haiying Peng,Fei Sun,Haiying Peng,Zihan Guo,Fei Sun,Ying Ji,Zihan Guo,Jianping Xing,Yanbo Ji,Yue Lü,Jianping Xing,Degan Lu,Yue Lu,De-Gan Lu",Disease Markers,2022.0

Objective: To develop and validate a nomogram combining clinical and CT-based radiomics features to differentiate pneumonia-type IMA and pneumonia. Methods: This retrospective study included 314 patients (172 men, 142 women; mean age, 60.3 ± 14.5 years) from six hospitals who underwent noncontrast chest CT showing consolidation and were diagnosed with pneumonia-type IMA (n=106) or pneumonia (n=208). Patients from three hospitals formed a training set (n=195) and a validation set (n=50), and patients from the other three hospitals formed the external test set (n=69). A model for predicting pneumonia-type IMA was built using clinical characteristics that were significant independent predictors of this diagnosis. Radiomics features were extracted from CT images by placing ROIs on areas of consolidation, and a radiomics signature of pneumonia-type IMA was constructed. A nomogram for predicting pneumonia-type IMA was constructed that combined features in the clinical model and the radiomics signature. Two cardiothoracic radiologists independently reviewed CT images in the external test set to diagnosis pneumonia-type IMA. Diagnosis performance was compared among models and radiologists. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed. Results: The clinical model included fever and family history of lung cancer. The radiomics signature included 15 radiomics features. DCA showed higher overall net benefit from the nomogram than from the clinical model. In the external test set, AUC was higher for the nomogram (0.85) than for the clinical model (0.71, P=.01), radiologist 1 (0.70, P=.04), and radiologist 2 (0.67, P=.012). In the external test set, the nomogram had sensitivity of 46.9%, specificity of 94.6%, and accuracy of 72.5%. Conclusions: The nomogram combining clinical variables and CT-based radiomics features outperformed the clinical model and two cardiothoracic radiologists in differentiating pneumonia-type IMA from pneumonia. Clinical Impact: The findings support potential clinical use of the nomogram for diagnosing pneumonia-type IMA in patients with consolidation on chest CT.","Xinxin Yu,Xinxin Yu,Shuai Zhang,Shuai Zhang,Jingxu Xu,Jingxu Xu,Yong Huang,Yong Huang,Hao Luo,Hao Luo,Chencui Huang,Chencui Huang,Pei Nie,Pei Nie,Yan Deng,Yan Deng,Ning Mao,Ning Mao,Ran Zhang,Ran Zhang,Lin Gao,Lin Gao,Sha Li,Sha Li,Bing Kang,Bing Kang,Ximing Wang,Ximing Wang",American Journal of Roentgenology,2022.0
10.3390/diagnostics12092196,,,Phantom Study on the Robustness of MR Radiomics Features: Comparing the Applicability of 3D Printed and Biological Phantoms,"The objectives of our study were to (a) evaluate the feasibility of using 3D printed phantoms in magnetic resonance imaging (MR) in assessing the robustness and repeatability of radiomic parameters and (b) to compare the results obtained from the 3D printed phantoms to metrics obtained in biological phantoms. To this end, three different 3D phantoms were printed: a Hilbert cube (5 × 5 × 5 cm3) and two cubic quick response (QR) code phantoms (a large phantom (large QR) (5 × 5 × 4 cm3) and a small phantom (small QR) (4 × 4 × 3 cm3)). All 3D printed and biological phantoms (kiwis, tomatoes, and onions) were scanned thrice on clinical 1.5 T and 3 T MR with 1 mm and 2 mm isotropic resolution. Subsequent analyses included analyses of several radiomics indices (RI), their repeatability and reliability were calculated using the coefficient of variation (CV), the relative percentage difference (RPD), and the interclass coefficient (ICC) parameters. Additionally, the readability of QR codes obtained from the MR images was examined with several mobile phones and algorithms. The best repeatability (CV ≤ 10%) is reported for the acquisition protocols with the highest spatial resolution. In general, the repeatability and reliability of RI were better in data obtained at 1.5 T (CV = 1.9) than at 3 T (CV = 2.11). Furthermore, we report good agreements between results obtained for the 3D phantoms and biological phantoms. Finally, analyses of the read-out rate of the QR code revealed better texture analyses for images with a spatial resolution of 1 mm than 2 mm. In conclusion, 3D printing techniques offer a unique solution to create textures for analyzing the reliability of radiomic data from MR scans.","G.

A preoperative, noninvasive, and cost-efficient predictive tool for MMR is critically needed. Therefore, this study developed and validated machine learning radiomics models for predicting MMR status in patients directly on preoperative MRI scans. Pathologically confirmed RC cases administered surgical resection in two distinct hospitals were examined in this retrospective trial. Totally, 78 and 33 cases were included in the training and test sets, respectively. Then, 65 cases were enrolled as an external validation set. Radiomics features were obtained from preoperative rectal MR images comprising T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), and combined multisequences. Four optimal features related to MMR status were selected by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. Support vector machine (SVM) learning was adopted to establish four predictive models, i.e., ModelT2WI, ModelDWI, ModelCE-T1WI, and Modelcombination, whose diagnostic performances were determined and compared by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and decision curve analysis (DCA). Modelcombination had better diagnostic performance compared with the other models in all datasets (all p < 0.05). The usefulness of the proposed model was confirmed by DCA. Therefore, the present pilot study showed the radiomics model combining multiple sequences derived from preoperative MRI is effective in predicting MMR status in RC cases.","Guodong Jing,Guodong Jing,Yukun Chen,Yukun Chen,Xiaolu Ma,Xiaolu Ma,Zhihui Li,Zhihui Li,Haidi Lu,Haidi Lu,Yuwei Xia,Yuwei Xia,Yong Lu,Yong Lu,Jianping Lu,Jianping Lu,Fu Shen,Shoukuan Fu",BioMed Research International,2022.0
10.1155/2022/4814577,,,Prediction of Hearing Prognosis of Large Vestibular Aqueduct Syndrome Based on the PyTorch Deep Learning Model,"In order to compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of patients with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome (LVAS) in the stable hearing loss (HL) group and the fluctuating HL group, this paper provides reference for clinicians' early intervention. From January 2001 to January 2016, patients with hearing impairment diagnosed as LVAS in infancy in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Children's Hospital of Fudan University were collected and divided into the stable HL group (n = 29) and the fluctuating HL group (n = 30). MRI images at initial diagnosis were collected, and various deep learning neural network training models were established based on PyTorch to classify and predict the two series. Vgg16_bn, vgg19_bn, and ResNet18, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with fewer layers, had favorable effects for model building, with accs of 0.9, 0.8, and 0.85, respectively. ResNet50, a CNN with multiple layers and an acc of 0.54, had relatively poor effects. The GoogLeNet-trained model performed best, with an acc of 0.98. We conclude that deep learning-based radiomics can assist doctors in accurately predicting LVAS patients to classify them into either fluctuating or stable HL types and adopt differentiated treatment methods.","Bo Duan,Zhengmin Xu,Bo Duan,Lili Pan,Zhengmin Xu,Lili Pan,Wenxia Chen,Zhongwei Qiao,Wenxia Chen,Zhongwei Qiao",Journal of Healthcare Engineering,2022.0

X-ray CT imaging can detect expressed radiological features in horses that experienced catastrophic fractures. Our objective was to assess whether expressed radiomic features in the PSBs of 50 horses can be used to develop machine learning models for predicting PSB fractures. The μCTs of intact contralateral PSBs from 50 horses, 30 of which suffered catastrophic fractures, and 20 controls were studied. From the 129 intact μCT images of PSBs, 102 radiomic features were computed using a variety of voxel resampling dimensions. Decision Trees and Wrapper methods were used to identify the 20 top expressed features, and six machine learning algorithms were developed to model the risk of fracture. The accuracy of all machine learning models ranged from 0.643 to 0.903 with an average of 0.754. On average, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest (RUS Boost), and Log-regression models had higher performance than K-means Nearest Neighbor, Neural Network, and Random Forest (Bagged Trees) models. Model accuracy peaked at 0.5 mm and decreased substantially when the resampling resolution was greater than or equal to 1 mm. We find that, for this in vitro dataset, it is possible to differentiate between unfractured PSBs from case and control horses using μCT images. It may be possible to extend these findings to the assessment of fracture risk in standing horses.","Parminder S. Basran,Parminder S. Basran,Sean P. McDonough,Sean McDonough,Scott Palmer,Scott E.

In the primary cohort, we extracted radiomics features from whole intratumoral regions on venous-phase CT images and constructed a radiomics signature by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. A radiomics model incorporating the radiomic signature and independent clinical factors was established via multivariable logistic regression and presented as a nomogram. Nomogram performance was compared with a clinical model and traditional CT report with respect to its discrimination and clinical usefulness. The radiomics nomogram was internally tested in an independent validation cohort.The radiomics signature, composed of 9 stable features, was associated with LNM in both the primary and validation cohorts (both p < .001). A radiomics model incorporating independent predictors of LNM (the radiomics signature, tumor subsite, and CT report) showed significantly better discrimination of nodal status than either the clinical model or the CT report in the primary cohort (AUC 0.91 vs. 0.84 vs. 0.68) and validation cohort (AUC 0.89 vs. 0.83 vs. 0.70). Decision curve analysis confirmed that the radiomics nomogram was superior to the clinical model and traditional CT report.The CT-based radiomics nomogram may improve preoperative identification of nodal status and help in clinical decision-making in LSCC.• The radiomics model showed favorable performance for predicting LN metastasis in LSCC patients. • The radiomics model may help in clinical decision-making and define patient subsets benefiting most from neck treatment.","Xingguo Zhao,Xingguo Zhao,Wenming Li,Wenming Li,Jiulou Zhang,Jiulou Zhang,Shui Tian,Shui Tian,Yang Zhou,Yang Zhou,Xiao‐Quan Xu,Xiaoquan Xu,Hao Hu,Hao Hu,Dapeng Lei,Dapeng Lei,Fei‐Yun Wu,Xiao-Quan Xu",European Radiology,2022.0

According to different prognoses, patients with basal ganglia hemorrhage were divided into two groups. Independent clinical risk factors were derived with univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Radiomics signatures were obtained using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. A radiomics score (Rad-score) was generated by 12 radiomics signatures of perihematomal edema (PHE) from CT images that were correlated with the prognosis of basal ganglia hemorrhage patients. A clinical-radiomics nomogram was conducted by combing the Rad-score and clinical risk factors using logistic regression analysis. The prediction performance of the nomogram was tested in the training cohort and verified in the test cohort.The clinical model conducted by four clinical risk factors and 12 radiomcis features were used to establish the Rad-score. The clinical-radiomics nomogram outperformed the clinical model in the training cohort [area under the curve (AUC), 0.92 vs. 0.85] and the test cohort (AUC, 0.91 vs 0.85). The clinical-radiomics nomogram showed good calibration and clinical benefit in both the training and test cohorts.Radiomics features of PHE in patients with basal ganglia hemorrhage could contribute to the outcome prediction.

10.3748/wjg.v28.i20.2176,35721882.0,,Radiomics for the detection of microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer, accounting for about 90% of liver cancer cases. It is currently the fifth most common cancer in the world and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Moreover, recurrence of HCC is common. Microvascular invasion (MVI) is a major factor associated with recurrence in postoperative HCC. It is difficult to evaluate MVI using traditional imaging modalities. Currently, MVI is assessed primarily through pathological and immunohistochemical analyses of postoperative tissue samples. Needle biopsy is the primary method used to confirm MVI diagnosis before surgery. As the puncture specimens represent just a small part of the tumor, and given the heterogeneity of HCC, biopsy samples may yield false-negative results. Radiomics, an emerging, powerful, and non-invasive tool based on various imaging modalities, such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and positron emission tomography, can predict the HCC-MVI status preoperatively by delineating the tumor and/or the regions at a certain distance from the surface of the tumor to extract the image features. Although positive results have been reported for radiomics, its drawbacks have limited its clinical translation. This article reviews the application of radiomics, based on various imaging modalities, in preoperative evaluation of HCC-MVI and explores future research directions that facilitate its clinical translation.","Kun Lv,Xin Cao,Kun Lv,Xin Cao,Peng Du,Jun-Yan Fu,Peng Du,Daoying Geng,Jun-Yan Fu,Jun Zhang,Dao-Ying Geng,Jun Zhang",World Journal of Gastroenterology,2022.0

Machine learning based radiomics model could predict axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) of BC accurately.To develop a machine learning model to predict ALNM of BC by focusing on the radiomics features of axillary lymphatic node (ALN).A group of 398 BC patients with 800 ALNs were retrospectively collected. A set of patient characteristics were obtained to form clinical factors. Three hundred and twenty-six radiomics features were extracted from each region of interest for ALN in contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) image. A framework composed of four feature selection methods and 14 machine learning classification algorithms was systematically applied. A clinical model, a radiomics model, and a combined model were developed using a cross-validation approach and compared. Metrics of the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to evaluate the performance of these models in the prediction of ALNM in BC.Among the 800 cases of ALNs, there were 388 cases of positive metastasis (48.50%) and 412 cases of negative metastasis (51.50%). The baseline clinical model achieved the performance with an AUC = 0.8998 (95% CI [0.8540, 0.9457]). The radiomics model achieved an AUC = 0.9081 (95%CI [0.8640, 0.9523]). The combined model using the clinical factors and radiomics features achieved the best results with an AUC = 0.9305 (95% CI [0.8928, 0.9682]).Combinations of feature selection methods and machine learning-based classification algorithms can develop promising predictive models to predict ALNM in BC using CECT features.

CT images of 20 patients with LARC were used to estimate 105 radiomic features of 7 classes (shape, first-order, GLCM, GLDM, GLRLM, GLSZM, and NGTDM). Radiomic features were estimated for 6 different isotropic resampling voxel sizes, using 10 interpolation algorithms (at fixed bin width) and 6 different bin widths (at fixed interpolation algorithm). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated to assess the variability in radiomic features estimation due to preprocessing. A repeated measures correlation analysis was performed to assess any linear correlation between radiomic feature estimate and resampling voxel size or bin width. Reproducibility of radiomic feature estimate, when assessed through ICC analysis, was nominally excellent (ICC > 0.9) for shape features, good (0.75 < ICC ≤ 0.9) or moderate (0.5 < ICC ≤ 0.75) for first-order features, and moderate or poor (0 ≤ ICC ≤ 0.5) for textural features. A number of radiomic features characterized by good or excellent reproducibility in terms of ICC showed however median CV values greater than 15%. For most textural features, a significant (p < 0.05) correlation between their estimate and resampling voxel size or bin width was found. In CT imaging of patients with LARC, the estimate of textural features, as well as of first-order features to a lesser extent, is appreciably biased by preprocessing. Accordingly, this should be taken into account when planning clinical or research studies, as well as when comparing results from different studies and performing multicenter studies.","Stefania Linsalata,Stefania Linsalata,S.

The naming convention is, however, different between them. Syngo.via had excellent agreement with the IBSI benchmark, while LIFEx and RadiomiX showed slightly worse agreement. Excellent reproducibility was achieved for shape features only, while intensity and texture features varied considerably with the imaging type. For intensity, excellent agreement ranged from 46% for the DCE maps to 100% for CECT, while this lowered to 44% and 73% for texture features, respectively. Wavelet features produced the greatest variation between applications, with an excellent agreement for only 3% to 11% features.Even with IBSI-compliance, the reproducibility of features between radiomics applications is not guaranteed. To evaluate variation, quality assurance of radiomics applications should be performed and repeated when updating to a new version or adding a new modality.","Zelda Paquier,Zelda Paquier,Shih-Li Chao,Shih-Li Chao,Anaïs Acquisto,Anaïs Acquisto,Chifra Fenton,Chifra Fenton,Thomas Guiot,Thomas Guiot,Jennifer Dhont,Jennifer Dhont,Hugo Levillain,Hugo Levillain,Ákos Gulybán,Akos Gulyban,Maria Antonietta Bali,Maria Antonietta Bali,N.

Applications include disease detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy response assessment/prediction. As radiation therapy aims for further individualized treatments, radiomics could play a critical role in various steps before, during and after treatment. Elucidation of the concept of radiomics-guided radiation therapy (RGRT) is the aim of this review, attempting to highlight opportunities and challenges underlying the use of radiomics to guide clinicians and physicists towards more effective radiation treatments. This work identifies the value of RGRT in various steps of radiotherapy from patient selection to follow-up, and subsequently provides recommendations to improve future radiotherapy using quantitative imaging features.","Hamid Abdollahi,Hamid Abdollahi,E Chin,Erika Chin,Haley Clark,Haley Clark,Derek Hyde,Steven Thomas,Derek E Hyde,Steven Thomas,Jonn Wu,Jonn Wu,Carlos Uribe,Arman Rahmim,Carlos Uribe,Arman Rahmim,Xinchi Hou",Physics in Medicine and Biology,2022.0

The relationship between renal function impairment and renal parenchymal volume (RPV) as along with radiomics features was explored using a multiple linear regression model and multiple logistic regression. Then, a combined model of RPV with radiomics features was constructed to comprehensively evaluate its predictive value.ResultsCompared with TKV, decreased RPV presented a closer relationship with renal function impairment, namely, with the impairment rate (RPV: 82.3% vs. TVK: 67.1%) and eGFR (RPV: r = 0.614, p < 0.001 vs. TKV: r = -0.452, p < 0.001), and showed higher predictive power (RPV: AUC = 0.752 [95%CI 0.692–0.805], p < 0.001 vs. TKV: AUC = 0.711 [95%CI 0.649–0.768], p < 0.001). Correspondingly, the radiomics analysis that was derived from the renal parenchyma also showed a satisfactory result (AUC = 0.849 [95%Cl 0.797–0.892], p < 0.001). Importantly, the predictive power for renal function impairment was further improved in the combined model of RPV and radiomics features (AUC = 0.902 [95%Cl 0.857–0.937], p < 0.001).ConclusionRenal parenchyma information may be a sensitive biomarker of renal function impairment in ADPKD, which can provide a new approach for clinically monitoring renal function, and may greatly improve the pre-hospital prevention and treatment effects.Graphical abstract","Yuhang Xie,Yuhang Xie,Mengmiao Xu,Mengmiao Xu,Yajie Chen,Xiaolan Zhu,Yajie Chen,Xiaolan Zhu,Shenghong Ju,Yuefeng Li,Shenghong Ju,Yuefeng Li",Abdominal Imaging,2022.0
10.3389/fonc.2022.1005805,,,The relationship between radiomics and pathomics in Glioblastoma patients: Preliminary results from a cross-scale association study,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) typically exhibits substantial intratumoral heterogeneity at both microscopic and radiological resolution scales. Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are two functional MRI techniques that are commonly employed in clinic for the assessment of GBM tumor characteristics. This work presents initial results aiming at determining if radiomics features extracted from preoperative ADC maps and post-contrast T1 (T1C) images are associated with pathomic features arising from H&amp;amp;E digitized pathology images. 48 patients from the public available CPTAC-GBM database, for which both radiology and pathology images were available, were involved in the study. 91 radiomics features were extracted from ADC maps and post-contrast T1 images using PyRadiomics. 65 pathomic features were extracted from cell detection measurements from H&amp;amp;E images. Moreover, 91 features were extracted from cell density maps of H&amp;amp;E images at four different resolutions. Radiopathomic associations were evaluated by means of Spearman’s correlation (ρ) and factor analysis. p values were adjusted for multiple correlations by using a false discovery rate adjustment. Significant cross-scale associations were identified between pathomics and ADC, both considering features (n = 186, 0.45 &amp;lt; ρ &amp;lt; 0.74 in absolute value) and factors (n = 5, 0.48 &amp;lt; ρ &amp;lt; 0.54 in absolute value). Significant but fewer ρ values were found concerning the association between pathomics and radiomics features (n = 53, 0.5 &amp;lt; ρ &amp;lt; 0.65 in absolute value) and factors (n = 2, ρ = 0.63 and ρ = 0.53 in absolute value). The results of this study suggest that cross-scale associations may exist between digital pathology and ADC and T1C imaging. This can be useful not only to improve the knowledge concerning GBM intratumoral heterogeneity, but also to strengthen the role of radiomics approach and its validation in clinical practice as “virtual biopsy”, introducing new insights for omics integration toward a personalized medicine approach.","Valentina Brancato,Valentina Brancato,Carlo Cavaliere,Carlo Cavaliere,Nunzia Garbino,Nunzia Garbino,Francesco Isgrò,Francesco Isgrò,Marco Salvatore,Marco Salvatore,Marco Aiello,Marco Aiello",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0
10.1259/bjr.20210598,,,Ultrasound-based radiomics nomogram for differentiation of triple-negative breast cancer from fibroadenoma,"Objective: This study aimed to develop a radiomics nomogram that incorporates radiomics, conventional ultrasound (US) and clinical features in order to differentiate triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) from fibroadenoma. Methods: A total of 182 pathology-proven fibroadenomas and 178 pathology-proven TNBCs, which underwent preoperative US examination, were involved and randomly divided into training (n = 253) and validation cohorts (n = 107). The radiomics features were extracted from the regions of interest of all lesions, which were delineated on the basis of preoperative US examination. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator model and the maximum relevance minimum redundancy algorithm were established for the selection of tumor status-related features and construction of radiomics signature (Rad-score). Then, multivariate logistic regression analyses were utilized to develop a radiomics model by incorporating the radiomics signature and clinical findings. Finally, the usefulness of the combined nomogram was assessed by using the receiver operator characteristic curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: The radiomics signature, composed of 12 selected features, achieved good diagnostic performance. The nomogram incorporated with radiomics signature and clinical data showed favorable diagnostic efficacy in the training cohort (AUC 0.986, 95% CI, 0.975–0.997) and validation cohort (AUC 0.977, 95% CI, 0.953–1.000). The radiomics nomogram outperformed the Rad-score and clinical models (p &lt; 0.05). The calibration curve and DCA demonstrated the good clinical utility of the combined radiomics nomogram. Conclusion: The radiomics signature is a potential predictive indicator for differentiating TNBC and fibroadenoma. The radiomics nomogram associated with Rad-score, US conventional features, and clinical data outperformed the Rad-score and clinical models. Advances in knowledge: Recent advances in radiomics-based US are increasingly showing potential for improved diagnosis, assessment of therapeutic response and disease prediction in oncology. Rad-score is an independent predictive indicator for differentiating TNBC and fibroadenoma.

However, it is not known whether the particular regions of interest (ROI) delineation method would affect the performance of the AI algorithm.The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of ROI delineation methods on model performance and observer consistency.In this retrospective analysis, ultrasound (US) measures of median nerves affected with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) were compared to median nerves in a control group without CTS. Two methods were used for delineation of the ROI: (1) the ROI along the hyperechoic medial edge of the median nerve but not including the epineurium (MN) (ROI1); and (2) the ROI including the hyperechoic epineurium (ROI2), respectively. The intra group correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to compare the observer consistency of ROI features (i.e. the corresponding radiomics parameters). Parameters α1 and α2 were obtained based on the ICC of ROI1 features and ROI2 features. The ROC analysis was used to determine the area under the curve (AUC) and evaluate the performance of the radiologists and network. In addition, four indices, namely sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction and negative prediction were analyzed too.A total of 136 wrists of 77 CTS group and 136 wrists of 74 control group were included in the study. Control group was matched to CTS group according to the age and sex. The observer consistency of ROI features delineated by the two schemes was different, and the consistency of ROI1 features was higher (α1 ˃ α2). The intra-observer consistency was higher than the inter-observer consistency regardless of the scheme, and the intra-observer consistency was higher when chose scheme one. The performances of models based on the two ROI features were different, although the AUC of each model was greater than 0.8.The model performed better when the MN epineurium was included in the ROI. Among five artificial intelligence algorithms, the Forest models (model1 achieved an AUC of 0.921 in training datasets and 0.830 in testing datasets; model2 achieved an AUC of 0.967 in training datasets and 0.872 in testing datasets.) obtained the highest performance, followed by the support vector machine (SVM) models and the Logistic models. The performances of the models were significantly better than the inexperienced radiologist (Dr. B. Z. achieved an AUC of 0.702).Different ROI delineation methods may affect the performance of the model and the consistency of observers. Model performance was better when the ROI contained the MN epineurium, and observer consistency was higher when the ROI was delineated along the hyperechoic medial border of the MN.","Shuyi Lyu,Shuyi Lyu,Yan Zhang,Yan Zhang,Meiwu Zhang,Meiwu Zhang,Maoqing Jiang,Mian Jiang,Jianjun Yu,Jianjun Yu,Jun Zhu,Jiazhen Zhu,Baisong Zhang,Baisong Zhang",Journal of Clinical Ultrasound,2022.0

The clinical utility of detecting PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry or next-generation sequencing has been written into guidelines. However, the application of these methods is limited in some circumstances where the biopsy size is small or not accessible, or a dynamic monitor is needed. Radiomics can noninvasively, in real-time, and quantitatively analyze medical images to reflect deeper information about diseases. Since radiomics was proposed in 2012, it has been widely used in disease diagnosis and differential diagnosis, tumor staging and grading, gene and protein phenotype prediction, treatment plan decision-making, efficacy evaluation, and prognosis prediction. To explore the feasibility of the clinical application of radiomics in predicting PD-L1 expression, immunotherapy response, and long-term prognosis, we comprehensively reviewed and summarized recently published works in NSCLC.

Normal liver tissue and 3 lesion types (benign cyst, hemangioma, and metastasis) were manually annotated in the phantom. The stability and discriminative power of 86 radiomics features were assessed in measurements taken from 240 CT series with 8 parameter variations of reconstruction algorithms, reconstruction kernels, slice thickness, and slice spacing. Pairwise parameter group and pairwise tissue class comparisons were performed using Wilcoxon signed rank tests.In total, 19,264 feature stability tests and 8256 discriminative power tests were performed. The 8 CT parameter variation pairwise group comparisons had statistically significant differences on average in 78/86 radiomics features.

A total of 248 patients were recruited for temporary independent validation as external validation cohort 1, with 103 patients from an external institute as the external validation cohort 2. CT image features to describe tumor spatial heterogeneity leveraging the measurement of diversification of tumor ecosystem, were extracted to build a marker, termed the EcoRad signature. Multivariate Cox regression was used to assess the EcoRad signature, with a prediction model constructed to demonstrate its incremental value to the traditional staging system for OS prediction.The EcoRad signature was significantly associated with OS in the training cohort [hazard ratio (HR)=6.670; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 3.433-12.956; P<0.001), external validation cohort 1 (HR=2.866; 95% CI: 1.646-4.990; P<0.001) and external validation cohort 2 (HR=3.342; 95% CI: 1.289-8.663; P=0.002).

We now know that human papillomavirus related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is a sub‐type of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with favourable prognosis and good response to therapy that needs a proper system of classification and staging. Thus, in routine practice it is essential to test patients for the presence of human papillomavirus. The most popular technique to assess human papillomavirus status is immunohistochemistry on biopsy samples with p16, which is an excellent surrogate for high‐risk human papillomavirus infection. Another highly sensitive and specific tissue‐based technique for the detection of human papillomavirus is RNAscope In situ hybridization that has a prohibitive cost, limiting its use in routine practice. Radiomics is an artificial intelligence based non‐invasive method of computational analysis of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and ultrasound images. Methods In this review, we summarise the last findings of radiomics applied to human papillomavirus associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

We compiled performance data and assessed publication quality using the radiomics quality score (RQS).A total of 170 publications were grouped into 5 categories of radiomics applications to meningiomas: Tumor detection and segmentation (21%), classification across neurologic diseases (54%), grading (14%), feature correlation (3%), and prognostication (8%). A majority focused on technical model development (73%) versus clinical applications (27%), with increasing adoption of deep learning. Studies utilized either private institutional (50%) or public (49%) datasets, with only 68% using a validation dataset. For detection and segmentation, radiomic models had a mean accuracy of 93.1 ± 8.1% and a dice coefficient of 88.8 ± 7.9%. Meningioma classification had a mean accuracy of 95.2 ± 4.0%.

Methods We identified publications on PubMed and Embase to determine differences between DMs and GMs in terms of receiver operating area under the curve (AUC). Results Of 1,229 records (between 2017 and 2021), 69 studies were included, 61 (88%) on tumours, 68 (99%) retrospective, and 39 (56%) single centre; 30 (43%) used an internal validation cohort; and 18 (26%) applied cross-validation. Studies with independent internal cohort had a median training sample of 196 (range 41–1,455); those with cross-validation had only 133 (43–1,426). Median size of validation cohorts was 73 (18–535) for internal and 94 (18–388) for external.

However, the interpretation of medical images can be highly subjective and dependent on the expertise of clinicians. Moreover, some potentially useful quantitative information in medical images, especially that which is not visible to the naked eye, is often ignored during clinical practice. In contrast, radiomics performs high-throughput feature extraction from medical images, which enables quantitative analysis of medical images and prediction of various clinical endpoints. Studies have reported that radiomics exhibits promising performance in diagnosis and predicting treatment responses and prognosis, demonstrating its potential to be a non-invasive auxiliary tool for personalized medicine. However, radiomics remains in a developmental phase as numerous technical challenges have yet to be solved, especially in feature engineering and statistical modeling. In this review, we introduce the current utility of radiomics by summarizing research on its application in the diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of treatment responses in patients with cancer. We focus on machine learning approaches, for feature extraction and selection during feature engineering and for imbalanced datasets and multi-modality fusion during statistical modeling. Furthermore, we introduce the stability, reproducibility, and interpretability of features, and the generalizability and interpretability of models. Finally, we offer possible solutions to current challenges in radiomics research.","Yuanpeng Zhang,Xinyun Zhang,Yu‐Ting Cheng,Bing Li,Xin-Zhi Teng,Jiang Zhang,Saikit Lam,Zhou Ta,Zongrui Ma,Jiabao Sheng,Victor C.

A recent publication identified radiomics features that are predictive of late irradiation-induced toxicity in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. In this study, we assessed the generalisability of these findings.The procedure described in the publication in question was applied to a cohort of 109 HNC patients treated with 50-70 Gy in 20-35 fractions using helical radiotherapy although there were inherent differences between the two patient populations and methodologies. On each slice of the planning CT with delineated parotid and submandibular glands, the imaging features that were previously identified as predictive of moderate-to-severe xerostomia and sticky saliva 12 months post radiotherapy (Xer12m and SS12m) were calculated. Specifically, Short Run Emphasis (SRE) and maximum CT intensity (maxHU) were evaluated for improvement in prediction of Xer12m and SS12m respectively, compared to models solely using baseline toxicity and mean dose to the salivary glands.None of the associations previously identified as statistically significant and involving radiomics features in univariate or multivariate models could be reproduced on our cohort.The discrepancies observed between the results of the two studies delineate limits to the generalisability of the previously reported findings. This may be explained by the differences in the approaches, in particular the imaging characteristics and subsequent methodological implementation. This highlights the importance of external validation, high quality reporting guidelines and standardisation protocols to ensure generalisability, replication and ultimately clinical implementation.","Thomas Berger,D.

The field of radiomics aims to develop imaging based biomarkers using methods rooted in artificial intelligence applied to medical imaging. However, a challenging aspect of developing predictive models for clinical use is that many quantitative features derived from image data exhibit instability or lack of reproducibility across different imaging systems or image-processing pipelines. Methods: To address this challenge, we propose a Bayesian sparse modeling approach for image classification based on radiomic features, where the inclusion of more reliable features is favored via a probit prior formulation. Results: We verify through simulation studies that this approach can improve feature selection and prediction given correct prior information. Finally, we illustrate the method with an application to the classification of head and neck cancer patients by human papillomavirus status, using as our prior information a reliability metric quantifying feature stability across different imaging systems.","Katherine Shoemaker,Rachel B.

Frequently, radiomic analyses through machine learning methods present issues caused by high dimensionality and multicollinearity, and redundant radiomic features are usually removed based on correlation analysis. We assessed the effect of preprocessing-in terms of voxel size resampling, discretization, and filtering-on correlation-based dimensionality reduction in radiomic features from cardiac T1 and T2 maps of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. For different combinations of preprocessing parameters, we performed a dimensionality reduction of radiomic features based on either Pearson's or Spearman's correlation coefficient, followed by the computation of the stability index. With varying resampling voxel size and discretization bin width, for both T1 and T2 maps, Pearson's and Spearman's dimensionality reduction produced a slightly different percentage of remaining radiomic features, with a relatively high stability index. For different filters, the remaining features' stability was instead relatively low. Overall, the percentage of eliminated radiomic features through correlation-based dimensionality reduction was more dependent on resampling voxel size and discretization bin width for textural features than for shape or first-order features. Notably, correlation-based dimensionality reduction was less sensitive to preprocessing when considering radiomic features from T2 compared with T1 maps.","Chiara Marzi,Daniela Marfisi,Andrea Barucci,Jacopo Del Meglio,Alessio Lilli,Claudio Vignali,Mario Mascalchi,Giancarlo Casolo,Stefano Diciotti,Antonio Claudio Traino,Carlo Tessa,Marco Giannelli,Marco Giannelli",Bioengineering,2023.0

Early diagnosis of AD and its precursor, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is crucial for timely intervention and management. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics showed a promising result for diagnosing and classifying AD, and MCI from normal subjects. Thus, we aimed to systematically evaluate the diagnostic performance of the MRI radiomics for this task. Methods and materials A comprehensive search of the current literature was conducted using relevant keywords in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from inception to October 17, 2022. Original studies discussing the diagnostic performance of MRI Radiomics for the classification of AD, MCI, and normal subjects were included. Method quality was evaluated with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2), and the Radiomic Quality Score tool (RQS). Results We identified 10 studies that met the inclusion criteria, involving a total of 3446 participants. The overall quality of the included studies was moderate to high. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of MRI radiomics for differentiating AD from normal subjects were 0.8822 (95% CI 0.7888-0.9376), and 0.8849 (95% CI 0.7978-0.9374), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of MRI radiomics for differentiating MCI from normal subjects were 0.7882 (95% CI 0.6272-0.8917) and 0.7736 (95% CI 0.6480-0.8639), respectively.

Therefore, personalized therapy requires continuous monitoring of receptor expressions and dynamic adaptation of applied targeted treatment options. Radiological in vivo techniques may allow receptor status tracking at high frequencies at low risk and cost. The present study aims to investigate the potential of receptor status prediction through machine-learning-based analysis of radiomic MR image features. The analysis is based on 412 brain metastases samples from 106 patients acquired between 09/2007 and 09/2021. Inclusion criteria were as follows: diagnosed cerebral metastases from breast cancer; histopathology reports on progesterone (PR), estrogen (ER), and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) receptor status; and availability of MR imaging data. In total, 3367 quantitative features of T1 contrast-enhanced, T1 non-enhanced, and FLAIR images and corresponding patient age were evaluated utilizing random forest algorithms. Feature importance was assessed using Gini impurity measures. Predictive performance was tested using 10 permuted 5-fold cross-validation sets employing the 30 most important features of each training set. Receiver operating characteristic areas under the curves of the validation sets were 0.82 (95% confidence interval [0.78; 0.85]) for ER+, 0.73 [0.69; 0.77] for PR+, and 0.74 [0.70; 0.78] for HER2+.

Computer-aided systems leveraging radiomic features can be used to better discriminate benign renal tumors from the malignant ones. The purpose of this work was to build a machine learning model to distinguish RO from clear cell RCC (ccRCC).We collected CT images of 77 patients, with 30 cases of RO (39%) and 47 cases of ccRCC (61%). Radiomic features were extracted both from the tumor volumes identified by the clinicians and from the tumor's zone of transition (ZOT). We used a genetic algorithm to perform feature selection, identifying the most descriptive set of features for the tumor classification. We built a decision tree classifier to distinguish between ROs and ccRCCs. We proposed two versions of the pipeline: in the first one, the feature selection was performed before the splitting of the data, while in the second one, the feature selection was performed after, i.e., on the training data only. We evaluated the efficiency of the two pipelines in cancer classification.The ZOT features were found to be the most predictive by the genetic algorithm. The pipeline with the feature selection performed on the whole dataset obtained an average ROC AUC score of 0.87 ± 0.09. The second pipeline, in which the feature selection was performed on the training data only, obtained an average ROC AUC score of 0.62 ± 0.17.The obtained results confirm the efficiency of ZOT radiomic features in capturing the renal tumor characteristics. We showed that there is a significant difference in the performances of the two proposed pipelines, highlighting how some already published radiomic analyses could be too optimistic about the real generalization capabilities of the models.","Gianluca Carlini,Caterina Gaudiano,Rita Golfieri,Nico Curti,Riccardo Biondi,Lorenzo Bianchi,Riccardo Schiavina,Francesca Giunchi,Lorenzo Faggioni,Enrico Giampieri,Alessandra Merlotti,Daniele Dall’Olio,Claudia Sala,Sara Pandolfi,Daniel Remondini,Arianna Rustici,Luigi Vincenzo Pastore,Leonardo Scarpetti,Barbara Bortolani,Laura Cercenelli,Eugenio Brunocilla,Emanuela Marcelli,Francesca Coppola,Gastone Castellani",,2023.0

However, the repeatability of radiomic features on PET has not been assessed in a test-retest setting. The prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted compound 18 F-DCFPyL is a high-affinity, high-contrast PET agent that we utilized in a test-retest cohort of men with metastatic prostate cancer (PC).Data of 21 patients enrolled in a prospective clinical trial with histologically proven PC underwent two 18 F-DCFPyL PET scans within 7 days, using identical acquisition and reconstruction parameters. Sites of disease were segmented and a set of 29 different radiomic parameters were assessed on both scans. We determined repeatability of quantification by using Pearson's correlations, within-subject coefficient of variation (wCOV), and Bland-Altman analysis.In total, 230 lesions (177 bone, 38 lymph nodes, 15 others) were assessed on both scans. For all investigated radiomic features, a broad range of inter-scan correlation was found (r, 0.07-0.95), with acceptable reproducibility for entropy and homogeneity (wCOV, 16.0% and 12.7%, respectively). On Bland-Altman analysis, no systematic increase or decrease between the scans was observed for either parameter (±1.96 SD: 1.07/-1.30, 0.23/-0.18, respectively). The remaining 27 tested radiomic metrics, however, achieved unacceptable high wCOV (≥21.7%).Many common radiomic features derived from a test-retest PET study had poor repeatability. Only Entropy and homogeneity achieved good repeatability, supporting the notion that those image biomarkers may be incorporated in future clinical trials. Those radiomic features based on high frequency aspects of images appear to lack the repeatability on PET to justify further study.","Rudolf A.

To date, several radiomic and machine learning studies investigated the feasibility of in vivo tumor characterization with variable outcomes. This study aims to investigate the effect of recently proposed fuzzy radiomics and compare its predictive performance to conventional radiomics in cancer imaging cohorts. In addition, lesion vs. lesion+surrounding fuzzy and conventional radiomic analysis was conducted.Previously published 11C Methionine (MET) positron emission tomography (PET) glioma, 18F-FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) lung, and 68GA-PSMA-11 PET/magneto-resonance imaging (MRI) prostate cancer retrospective cohorts were included in the analysis to predict their respective clinical endpoints. Four delineation methods including manually defined reference binary (Ref-B), its smoothed, fuzzified version (Ref-F), as well as extended binary (Ext-B) and its fuzzified version (Ext-F) were incorporated to extract imaging biomarker standardization initiative (IBSI)-conform radiomic features from each cohort. Machine learning for the four delineation approaches was performed utilizing a Monte Carlo cross-validation scheme to estimate the predictive performance of the four delineation methods.Reference fuzzy (Ref-F) delineation outperformed its binary delineation (Ref-B) counterpart in all cohorts within a volume range of 938-354987 mm3 with relative cross-validation area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC) of +4.7-10.4. Compared to Ref-B, the highest AUC performance difference was observed by the Ref-F delineation in the glioma cohort (Ref-F: 0.74 vs. Ref-B: 0.70) and in the prostate cohort by Ref-F and Ext-F (Ref-F: 0.84, Ext-F: 0.86 vs. Ref-B: 0.80). In addition, fuzzy radiomics decreased feature redundancy by approx. 20%.Fuzzy radiomics has the potential to increase predictive performance particularly in small lesion sizes compared to conventional binary radiomics in PET. We hypothesize that this effect is due to the ability of fuzzy radiomics to model partial volume effects and delineation uncertainties at small lesion boundaries. In addition, we consider that the lower redundancy of fuzzy radiomic features supports the identification of imaging biomarkers in future studies. Future studies shall consider systematically analyzing lesions and their surroundings with fuzzy and binary radiomics.","Marko Grahovac,Clemens P.

Methods A total of 478 patients with confirmed stage II CRC, with 313 from Shanghai (Training set) and 165 from Beijing (Validation set) were enrolled. Optimized features were selected using GridSearchCV and Iterative Feature Elimination (IFE) algorithm. Subsequently, we developed an ensemble random forest classifier to predict the probability of disease relapse.We evaluated the performance of the model using the concordance index (C-index), precision-recall curves, and area under the precision-recall curves (AUC PR ). Results A radiomic model (namely the RF5 model) consisting of four radiomics features and T stage were developed. The RF5 model performed better than simple radiomics features or T stage alone, with higher C-index and AUC PR , as well as better sensitivity and specificity (C-index RF5 : 0.836; AUC PR = 0.711; Sensitivity = 0.610; Specificity = 0.935). We identified an optimal cutoff value of 0.1215 to split patients into high- or low-score subgroups, with those in the low-score group having better disease-free survival (DFS) (Training Set: P = 1.4e-11; Validation Set: P = 0.015). Furthermore, patients in the high-score group who received ACT had better DFS compared to those who did not receive ACT ( P = 0.04). However, no statistical difference was found in low-score patients ( P = 0.17). Conclusion The radiomic model can serve as a reliable tool for assessing prognosis and identifying the optimal candidates for ACT in Stage II CRC patients.

The pretreatment baseline predictors that were used to predict drug treatment outcomes included patient demographic and clinical information, gene data, electroencephalogram data, and radiomic features that were extracted from pretreatment MR imaging scans. The Spearman correlation coefficient and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were calculated to select the most relevant features for the drug treatment outcome to build a comprehensive model with radiomic and clinical features for clinical application.Four MR imaging-based radiomic features and 5 key clinical features were selected to predict the drug treatment outcome. Good discriminative performances were achieved in testing cohorts (area under the curve = 0.85, accuracy = 80.0%, sensitivity = 0.75, and specificity = 0.83) for the epilepsy drug treatment outcome. The model of radiomic and clinical features resulted in favorable calibration curves in all cohorts.Our results suggested that the radiomic and clinical features model may predict the epilepsy drug treatment outcome. Age of onset, infantile spasms, antiseizure medication numbers, epileptiform discharge in left parieto-occipital area of electroencephalography, and gene mutation type are the key clinical factors to predict the epilepsy drug treatment outcome.

Six classifiers, including Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel, adaptive boosting (AB), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) were used to establish predictive models, and the predictive performance of the six classifiers was evaluated through five-fold cross-validation. The performance of the predictive models was evaluated using the AUC and other metrics. After that, the model with the best predictive performance was tested using the external data from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA).According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 240 patients with gliomas were identified for inclusion in the study, including 106 grade 2, 68 grade 3, and 66 grade 4 gliomas. A total of 150 features was selected, and the MLP classifier had the best predictive performance among the six classifiers based on T2-FLAIR (mean AUC of 0.80 ± 0.07). The SVM classifier had the best predictive performance among the six classifiers based on DWI (mean AUC of 0.84 ± 0.05); the SVM classifier had the best predictive performance among the six classifiers based on CE-T1WI (mean AUC of 0.85 ± 0.06). Among the six classifiers, based on ROI1, the MLP classifier had the best prediction performance (mean AUC of 0.78 ± 0.07); among the six classifiers, based on ROI2, the SVM classifier had the best prediction performance (mean AUC of 0.82 ± 0.07). Among the six classifiers, based on the multimodal MRI of all the ROIs, the SVM classifier had the best prediction performance (average AUC of 0.85 ± 0.04). The SVM classifier, based on the multimodal MRI of all the ROIs, achieved an AUC of 0.81 using the external data from TCIA.The prediction model, based on preoperative conventional multimodal MRI radiomics, established in this study can conveniently, accurately, and noninvasively classify adult gliomas into grades 2-4, providing certain assistance for the precise diagnosis and treatment of patients and optimizing their clinical management.","Peijun Du,Xiao Liu,Xuefan Wu,Jiawei Chen,Aihong Cao,Daoying Geng",,2023.0

Radiogenomics is an extension of radiomics that combines conventional radiomics techniques with molecular analysis in the form of genomic and transcriptomic data, serving as an alternative to costly, labour-intensive genetic testing. Data on radiomics and radiogenomics in the field of pelvic oncology remain novel concepts in the literature. We aim to perform an up-to-date analysis of current applications of radiomics and radiogenomics in the field of pelvic oncology, particularly focusing on the prediction of survival, recurrence and treatment response. Several studies have applied these concepts to colorectal, urological, gynaecological and sarcomatous diseases, with individual efficacy yet poor reproducibility. This article highlights the current applications of radiomics and radiogenomics in pelvic oncology, as well as the current limitations and future directions. Despite a rapid increase in publications investigating the use of radiomics and radiogenomics in pelvic oncology, the current evidence is limited by poor reproducibility and small datasets. In the era of personalised medicine, this novel field of research has significant potential, particularly for predicting prognosis and guiding therapeutic decisions. Future research may provide fundamental data on how we treat this cohort of patients, with the aim of reducing the exposure of high-risk patients to highly morbid procedures.","Niall J.

Review,"This work provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in the field of radiomic diagnostics and artificial intelligence (AI) in the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases. The integration of radiochemical analysis and AI has allowed for more accurate and precise diagnoses of pancreatic diseases, including pancreatic cancer. The review highlights the different stages of radiomic analysis, such as data collection, preprocessing, tumour segmentation, data detection and extraction, modeling, statistical processing, and data validation, which are essential for the accurate diagnosis of pancreatic diseases. Furthermore, the review evaluates the possibilities of using AI and artificial neural networks in surgical and oncological pancreatology. The features and advantages of using radiochemical analysis and AI in the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer are also described. These advancements have the potential to improve patient outcomes, as early and accurate diagnosis can lead to earlier treatment and better chances of recovery. However, the limitations associated with the use of radiometry and AI in pancreatology are also noted, such as the lack of standardization and the potential for false positives or false negatives.

The growing importance of radiomics applied to oncology in improving diagnosis, cancer staging and grading, and improved personalized treatment, has been well established; yet, this new analysis technique has still few applications in cardiovascular imaging. Several studies have shown promising results describing how radiomics principles could improve the diagnostic accuracy of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosis, risk stratification, and follow-up of patients with coronary heart disease (CAD), ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), hypertensive heart disease (HHD), and many other cardiovascular diseases. Such quantitative approach could be useful to overcome the main limitations of CCTA and MRI in the evaluation of cardiovascular diseases, such as readers' subjectiveness and lack of repeatability. Moreover, this new discipline could potentially overcome some technical problems, namely the need of contrast administration or invasive examinations. Despite such advantages, radiomics is still not applied in clinical routine, due to lack of standardized parameters acquisition, inconsistent radiomic methods, lack of external validation, and different knowledge and experience among the readers. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide a recent update on the status of radiomics clinical applications in cardiovascular imaging.","Tiziano Polidori,Domenico De Santis,Carlotta Rucci,Giuseppe Tremamunno,Giulia Piccinni,Luca Pugliese,Marta Zerunian,Gisella Guido,Francesco Pucciarelli,Benedetta Bracci,Michela Polici,Andréa Laghi,Damiano Caruso",,2023.0

This review aims to analyze the repeatability of radiomics studies in colorectal cancer and to evaluate the current status of radiomics in the field of colorectal cancer. Methods The included studies in this review by searching from the PubMed and Embase databases. Then each study in our review was evaluated using the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS). We analyzed the factors that may affect the repeatability in the radiomics workflow and discussed the repeatability of the included studies. Results A total of 188 studies was included in this review, of which only two (2/188, 1.06%) studies controlled the influence of individual factors. In addition, the median score of RQS was 11 (out of 36), range-1 to 27. Conclusions The RQS score was moderately low, and most studies did not consider the repeatability of radiomics features, especially in terms of Intra-individual, scanners, and scanning parameters. To improve the generalization of the radiomics model, it is necessary to further control the variable factors of repeatability.","Ying Liu,Xiaoqin Wei,Feng Xing,Yan Liu,Guiling Feng,Yong Du",,2023.0

Methods Thirty fetal MRI scans including two axial T2-weighted acquisitions of the lungs were analysed. 2D (lung at the level of the carina) and 3D (whole lung) ROIs were manually segmented using ITK-Snap. Ninety-five radiomics features were extracted from 2 and 3D ROIs in initial and repeat acquisitions using Pyradiomics. Radiomics feature intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated between 2 and 3D ROIs in the initial acquisition, and between 2 and 3D ROIs in repeated acquisitions, respectively. Results MRI data of 11 (36.7%) female and 19 (63.3%) male fetuses acquired at a median 25 + 0 gestational weeks plus days (GW) (interquartile range [IQR] 23 + 4 − 27 + 0 GW) were assessed. Median radiomics feature ICC between 2 and 3D ROIs in the initial MRI acquisition was 0.733 (IQR 0.313–0.814, range 0.018–0.970). ICCs between radiomics features extracted using 3D ROIs in initial and repeat acquisitions (median 0.908 [IQR 0.824–0.929, range 0.335–0.996]) were significantly higher compared to 2D ROIs (0.771 [0.699–0.835, 0.048–0.965]) ( p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Fetal MRI radiomics features extracted from 3D whole lung segmentation masks showed significantly higher reproducibility across repeat acquisitions compared to 2D ROIs. Therefore, fetal MRI whole lung radiomics features are robust diagnostic and potentially prognostic tools in the image-based in-vivo quantitative assessment of lung development.","Martin L.

Despite the overall more favorable outcome, the observed heterogeneous treatment response within this patient group highlights the need for additional means to prognosticate and guide clinical decision-making. Promising prediction models using radiomics from primary OPSCC have been derived. However, no model/s using metastatic lymphadenopathy exist to allow prognostication in those instances when the primary tumor is not seen. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether radiomics using metastatic lymphadenopathy allows for the development of a useful risk assessment model comparable to the primary tumor and whether additional knowledge of the HPV status further improves its prognostic efficacy. Materials and Methods: 80 consecutive patients diagnosed with stage III-IV OPSCC between February 2009 and October 2015, known human papillomavirus status, and pre-treatment CT images were retrospectively identified. Manual segmentation of primary tumor and metastatic lymphadenopathy was performed and the extracted texture features were used to develop multivariate assessment models to prognosticate treatment response. Results: Texture analysis of either the primary or metastatic lymphadenopathy from pre-treatment enhanced CT images can be used to develop models for the stratification of treatment outcomes in OPSCC patients. AUCs range from .78 to .85 for the various OPSCC groups tested, indicating high predictive capability of the models. Conclusions: This preliminary study can form the basis multi-centre trial that may help optimize treatment and improve quality of life in patients with OPSCC in the era of personalized medicine.","Yuh-Shin Chang,Jaykumar Raghavan Nair,Connor C.

The PK parameter maps of whole tumors at isotropic resolution were generated using the two-compartment exchange model combined with the three-site-two-exchange model. The textural features of these isotropic images were compared with those of simulated, thick-slice, anisotropic images to assess the influence of anisotropic voxel resolution on the textural features of tumors. The isotropic images and parameter maps captured distributions of high pixel intensity that were absent in the corresponding anisotropic images with thick slices. A significant difference was observed in 33% of the histogram and textural features extracted from anisotropic images and parameter maps, compared to those extracted from corresponding isotropic images. Anisotropic images in different orthogonal orientations demonstrated 42.1% of the histogram and textural features to be significantly different from those of isotropic images. This study demonstrates that the anisotropy of voxel resolution needs to be carefully considered when comparing the textual features of tumor PK parameters and contrast-enhanced images.","Karl Kiser,Jin Zhang,Sungheon Kim",,2023.0

The goal of this study was to assess the study quality and clinical value of machine learning and radiomic-based quantitative imaging studies for predicting the outcomes of EC patients after chemoradiotherapy.PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were searched for eligible articles. The methodological quality and risk of bias were evaluated using the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS), Image Biomarkers Standardization Initiative (IBSI) Guideline, and Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement, as well as the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. A meta-analysis of the evidence focusing on predicting chemoradiotherapy response and outcome in EC patients was implemented.Forty-six studies were eligible for qualitative synthesis. The mean RQS score was 9.07, with an adherence rate of 42.52%. The adherence rates of the TRIPOD and IBSI were 61.70 and 43.17%, respectively. Ultimately, 24 studies were included in the meta-analysis, of which 16 studies had a pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 (0.76-0.89), 0.83 (0.79-0.86), and 0.84 (0.81-0.87) in neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy datasets, as well as 0.84 (0.75-0.93), 0.89 (0.83-0.93), and 0.93 (0.90-0.95) in definitive chemoradiotherapy datasets, respectively. Moreover, radiomics could distinguish patients from the low-risk and high-risk groups with different disease-free survival (DFS) (pooled hazard ratio: 3.43, 95% CI 2.39-4.92) and overall survival (pooled hazard ratio: 2.49, 95% CI 1.91-3.25). The results of subgroup and regression analyses showed that some of the heterogeneity was explained by the combination with clinical factors, sample size, and usage of the deep learning (DL) signature.Noninvasive radiomics offers promising potential for optimizing treatment decision-making in EC patients. However, it is necessary to make scientific advancements in EC radiomics regarding reproducibility, clinical usefulness analysis, and open science categories. Improved model reporting of study objectives, blind assessment, and image processing steps are required to help promote real clinical applications of radiomics in EC research.","Zhi Zhang Yang,Jie Gong,Jie Li,Haitao Sun,Yanglin Pan,Lina Zhao",,2023.0

To evaluate the proposed method, we propose a novel evaluation schema for generative and synthetic approaches based on radiomic features. For the evaluation purpose, we consider 510 pair-slices from 102 patients to train two different GAN-based architectures Cycle GAN and Dual Cycle-Consistent Adversarial network (DC2Anet). The results indicate that generative methods can produce similar results to the original sequence without significant change in the radiometric feature. Therefore, such a method can assist clinics to make decisions based on the generated image when different sequences are not available or there is not enough time to re-perform the MRI scans.","Seyed Masoud Rezaeijo,Nahid Chegeni,Fariborz Baghaei Naeini,Dimitrios Makris,Spyridon Bakas",,2023.0

Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using eight databases and gray literature. Two independent observers rated these articles according to exclusion and inclusion criteria. 23 papers were included to assess the radiomics features related to jawbone pathologies. Included studies were evaluated by using JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies. Results: Agnostic features were mined from periapical, dental panoramic radiographs, cone beam CT, CT and MRI images of six different jawbone alterations. The most frequent features mined were texture-, shape- and intensity-based features. Only 13 studies described the machine learning step, and the best results were obtained with Support Vector Machine and random forest classifier. For osteoporosis diagnosis and classification, filtering, shape-based and Tamura texture features showed the best performance. For temporomandibular joint pathology, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), gray level run length matrix (GLRLM), Gray Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM), first-order statistics analysis and shape-based analysis showed the best results. Considering odontogenic and non-odontogenic cysts and tumors, contourlet and SPHARM features, first-order statistical features, GLRLM, GLCM had better indexes. For odontogenic cysts and granulomas, first-order statistical analysis showed better classification results. Conclusions: GLCM was the most frequent feature, followed by first-order statistics, and GLRLM features. No study reported predicting response, prognosis or therapeutic response, but instead diseases diagnosis or classification.

Subjecting combined Radiomics and Clinical features to Machine Learning (ML) could offer better predictions of clinical outcomes. This study is a comparative performance analysis of ML models with Clinical, Radiomics, and Clinico-Radiomic datasets for predicting four outcomes of HNSCC treated with Curative Radiation Therapy (RT): Distant Metastases, Locoregional Recurrence, New Primary, and Residual Disease. Methodology The study used retrospective data of 311 HNSCC patients treated with radiotherapy between 2013–2018 at our centre. Binary prediction models were developed for the four outcomes with Clinical-only, Clinico-Radiomic, and Radiomics-only datasets, using three different ML classification algorithms namely, Random Forest (RF), Kernel Support Vector Machine (KSVM), and XGBoost. The best-performing ML algorithms of the three dataset groups was then compared. Results The Clinico-Radiomic dataset using KSVM classifier provided the best prediction. Predicted mean testing accuracy for Distant Metastases, Locoregional Recurrence, New Primary, and Residual Disease was 97%, 72%, 99%, and 96%, respectively. The mean area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) was calculated and displayed for all the models using three dataset groups. Conclusion Clinico-Radiomic dataset improved the predictive ability of ML models over clinical features alone, while models built using Radiomics performed poorly. Radiomics data could therefore effectively supplement clinical data in predicting outcomes.","Tarun Gangil,Krishna Sharan,B.

The aim of this study is to develop and validate an 18 F-FDG PET/CT-derived radiomics model combining with clinical risk factors for predicting PM of GC.In this retrospective study, 410 GC patients (PM - = 281, PM + = 129) who underwent preoperative 18 F-FDG PET/CT images from January 2015 to October 2021 were analyzed. The patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 288) and a validation cohort (n = 122). The maximum relevance and minimum redundancy (mRMR) and the least shrinkage and selection operator method were applied to select feature. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was preformed to develop the predicting model. Discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness were used to evaluate the performance of the nomogram.Fourteen radiomics feature parameters were selected to construct radiomics model. The area under the curve (AUC) of the radiomics model were 0.86 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.81-0.90] in the training cohort and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.78-0.92) in the validation cohort. After multivariable logistic regression, peritoneal effusion, mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean), carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) and radiomics signature showed statistically significant differences between different PM status patients( P < 0.05). They were chosen to construct the comprehensive predicting model which showed a performance with an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89-0.95) in the training cohort and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.86-0.98) in the validation cohort, respectively.The nomogram based on 18 F-FDG PET/CT radiomics features and clinical risk factors can be potentially applied in individualized treatment strategy-making for GC patients before the surgery.","Jiexiong Xie,Beihui Xue,Shuying Bian,Xiaowei Ji,Jie Lin,Xiujuan Zheng,Kun Tang",,2023.0

10.3390/genes14091742,37761882.0,,An Automated Prognostic Model for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) constitutes a leading cause of cancer-related mortality despite advances in detection and treatment methods. While computed tomography (CT) serves as the current gold standard for initial evaluation of PDAC, its prognostic value remains limited, as it relies on diagnostic stage parameters encompassing tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis. Radiomics have recently shown promise in predicting postoperative survival of PDAC patients; however, they rely on manual pancreas and tumor delineation by clinicians. In this study, we collected a dataset of pre-operative CT scans from a cohort of 40 PDAC patients to evaluate a fully automated pipeline for survival prediction. Employing nnU-Net trained on an external dataset, we generated automated pancreas and tumor segmentations. Subsequently, we extracted 854 radiomic features from each segmentation, which we narrowed down to 29 via feature selection. We then combined these features with the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) system staging parameters, as well as the patient’s age. We trained a random survival forest model to perform an overall survival prediction over time, as well as a random forest classifier for the binary classification of two-year survival, using repeated cross-validation for evaluation. Our results exhibited promise, with a mean C-index of 0.731 for survival modeling and a mean accuracy of 0.76 in two-year survival prediction, providing evidence of the feasibility and potential efficacy of a fully automated pipeline for PDAC prognostication. By eliminating the labor-intensive manual segmentation process, our streamlined pipeline demonstrates an efficient and accurate prognostication process, laying the foundation for future research endeavors.","Ioannis A.

10.1109/imip57114.2023.00012,,,Application in Tumor Classification Based on Target Morphological Consistency Patches Adaptively Extracted and Priori Guided Feature Extraction Method,"PET/CT images have the characteristics of accurate location and high sensitivity for tumor lesions, so the classification on PET/CT images is of great significance in clinical practice. In terms of visual tasks such as image classification, models such as vision transformer based on attention mechanism has been proved to be effective. However, medical images are different from natural images, and only using image information as model input can not fully and effectively express target characteristics. In this paper, we propose a method of adaptive extraction of the patch to maintain the morphological characteristics of the target, and add the radiomics features to the attention mechanism as a priori guidance knowledge for feature extraction, which is applied to the classification of PET/CT tumors. Firstly, for the original PET/CT image, the patch sequence is obtained by the adaptive patch extraction method based on overlapping region and sliding stride, which adapts to the input of the model while maintaining the morphological characteristics of the target; Secondly, the corresponding image token and radiomics feature vector of patches are obtained through linear projection layer and radiomics feature extractor respectively; Finally, the two are input into the multi-head attention module of the encoder to build a multi-feature attention mechanism, and complete the classification decision after the feature extraction. To verify the effectiveness of this method, we conducted experiments on the whole-body public dataset FDG-PET-CT-Lesions, and classified PET/CT images into negative, melanoma, lymphoma and non-small cell lung cancer, and the classification accuracy reached 0.8652. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a high performance on tumor classification in PET/CT images, and can be applied to classification of various tumors.","Yonglong Zhang,Xiaohua Ma,Johana Comlan,Huiyan Jiang,Wenbo Pang",,2023.0
10.1186/s12967-023-04437-4,37674169.0,,Application of radiomics-based multiomics combinations in the tumor microenvironment and cancer prognosis,"Abstract The advent of immunotherapy, a groundbreaking advancement in cancer treatment, has given rise to the prominence of the tumor microenvironment (TME) as a critical area of research. The clinical implications of an improved understanding of the TME are significant and far-reaching. Radiomics has been increasingly utilized in the comprehensive assessment of the TME and cancer prognosis. Similarly, the advancement of pathomics, which is based on pathological images, can offer additional insights into the panoramic view and microscopic information of tumors. The combination of pathomics and radiomics has revolutionized the concept of a “digital biopsy”. As genomics and transcriptomics continue to evolve, integrating radiomics with genomic and transcriptomic datasets can offer further insights into tumor and microenvironment heterogeneity and establish correlations with biological significance. Therefore, the synergistic analysis of digital image features (radiomics, pathomics) and genetic phenotypes (genomics) can comprehensively decode and characterize the heterogeneity of the TME as well as predict cancer prognosis. This review presents a comprehensive summary of the research on important radiomics biomarkers for predicting the TME, emphasizing the interplay between radiomics, genomics, transcriptomics, and pathomics, as well as the application of multiomics in decoding the TME and predicting cancer prognosis. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in multiomics research. In conclusion, this review highlights the crucial role of radiomics and multiomics associations in the assessment of the TME and cancer prognosis. The combined analysis of radiomics, pathomics, genomics, and transcriptomics is a promising research direction with substantial research significance and value for comprehensive TME evaluation and cancer prognosis assessment.","Wendi Kang,Xiang Qiu,Yingen Luo,Jianwei Luo,Yang Liu,Jing Xi,Xiao Li,Zhigang Yang",,2023.0
10.1016/j.media.2023.102972,37742374.0,,Automatic Head and Neck Tumor segmentation and outcome prediction relying on FDG-PET/CT images: Findings from the second edition of the HECKTOR challenge,"By focusing on metabolic and morphological tissue properties respectively, FluoroDeoxyGlucose (FDG)-Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Computed Tomography (CT) modalities include complementary and synergistic information for cancerous lesion delineation and characterization (e.g. for outcome prediction), in addition to usual clinical variables. This is especially true in Head and Neck Cancer (HNC). The goal of the HEad and neCK TumOR segmentation and outcome prediction (HECKTOR) challenge was to develop and compare modern image analysis methods to best extract and leverage this information automatically. We present here the post-analysis of HECKTOR 2nd edition, at the 24th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2021. The scope of the challenge was substantially expanded compared to the first edition, by providing a larger population (adding patients from a new clinical center) and proposing an additional task to the challengers, namely the prediction of Progression-Free Survival (PFS). To this end, the participants were given access to a training set of 224 cases from 5 different centers, each with a pre-treatment FDG-PET/CT scan and clinical variables. Their methods were subsequently evaluated on a held-out test set of 101 cases from two centers. For the segmentation task (Task 1), the ranking was based on a Borda counting of their ranks according to two metrics: mean Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and median Hausdorff Distance at 95th percentile (HD95). For the PFS prediction task, challengers could use the tumor contours provided by experts (Task 3) or rely on their own (Task 2). The ranking was obtained according to the Concordance index (C-index) calculated on the predicted risk scores. A total of 103 teams registered for the challenge, for a total of 448 submissions and 29 papers. The best method in the segmentation task obtained an average DSC of 0.759, and the best predictions of PFS obtained a C-index of 0.717 (without relying on the provided contours) and 0.698 (using the expert contours). An interesting finding was that best PFS predictions were reached by relying on DL approaches (with or without explicit tumor segmentation, 4 out of the 5 best ranked) compared to standard radiomics methods using handcrafted features extracted from delineated tumors, and by exploiting alternative tumor contours (automated and/or larger volumes encompassing surrounding tissues) rather than relying on the expert contours. This second edition of the challenge confirmed the promising performance of fully automated primary tumor delineation in PET/CT images of HNC patients, although there is still a margin for improvement in some difficult cases. For the first time, the prediction of outcome was also addressed and the best methods reached relatively good performance (C-index above 0.7). Both results constitute another step forward toward large-scale outcome prediction studies in HNC.","Vincent Andrearczyk,Valentin Oreiller,Sarah Boughdad,Catherine Cheze Le Rest,Olena Tankyevych,Hesham Elhalawani,Mario Jreige,John O.

10.3389/fonc.2023.1168995,,,CT-based dosiomics and radiomics model predicts radiation-induced lymphopenia in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients,"Purpose This study aims to develop and validate a model predictive for the incidence of grade 4 radiation-induced lymphopenia (G4RIL), based on dosiomics features and radiomics features from the planning CT of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated by radiation therapy. Methods The dataset of 125 NPC patients treated with radiotherapy from August 2018 to March 2019 was randomly divided into two sets—an 85-sample training set and a 40-sample test set. Dosiomics features and radiomics features of the CT image within the skull bone and cervical vertebrae were extracted. A feature selection process of multiple steps was employed to identify the features that most accurately forecast the data and eliminate superfluous or insignificant ones. A support vector machine learning classifier with correction for imbalanced data was trained on the patient dataset for prediction of RIL (positive classifier for G4RIL, negative otherwise). The model’s predictive capability was gauged by gauging its sensitivity (the likelihood of a positive test being administered to patients with G4RIL) and specificity in the test set. The area beneath the ROC curve (AUC) was utilized to explore the association of characteristics with the occurrence of G4RIL. Results Three clinical features, three dosiomics features, and three radiomics features exhibited significant correlations with G4RIL. Those features were then used for model construction. The combination model, based on nine robust features, yielded the most impressive results with an ACC value of 0.88 in the test set, while the dosiomics model, with three dosiomics features, had an ACC value of 0.82, the radiomics model, with three radiomics features, had an ACC value of 0.82, and the clinical model, with its initial features, had an ACC value of 0.6 for prediction performance. Conclusion The findings show that radiomics and dosiomics features are correlated with the G4RIL of NPC patients. The model incorporating radiomics features and dosiomics features from planning CT can predict the incidence of G4RIL in NPC patients.","Qiu‐An Huang,Chia-Han Yang,Jinmeng Pang,Biao Zeng,Pei Yang,Rongrong Zhou,Haijian Wu,Liangfang Shen,Rong Zhang,Lu Fan,Y.

Purpose To develop and evaluate radiomics nomograms based on clinical factors and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the preoperative differentiation of NF from STS. Material and Methods This retrospective study analyzed the MRI data of 27 patients with pathologically diagnosed NF and 58 patients with STS who were randomly divided into training (n = 62) and validation (n = 23) groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the clinical factors and semantic features of MRI. Radiomics analysis was applied to fat-suppressed T1-weighted (T1W-FS) images, fat-suppressed T2-weighted (T2W-FS) images, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1W) images. The radiomics nomograms incorporating the radiomics signatures, clinical factors, and semantic features of MRI were developed. ROC curves and AUCs were carried out to compare the performance of the clinical factors, radiomics signatures, and clinical radiomics nomograms. Results Tumor location, size, heterogeneous signal intensity on T2W-FS imaging, heterogeneous signal intensity on CE-T1W imaging, margin definitions on CE-T1W imaging, and septa were independent predictors for differentiating NF from STS ( P &lt; 0.05). The performance of the radiomics signatures based on T2W-FS imaging (AUC = 0.961) and CE-T1W imaging (AUC = 0.938) was better than that based on T1W-FS imaging (AUC = 0.833). The radiomics nomograms had AUCs of 0.949, which demonstrated good clinical utility and calibration.

Methods PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for original studies published until 10 November 2022, and the studies satisfying the inclusion criteria were included. Characteristics of included studies and radiomics approach and data for constructing 2 × 2 tables were extracted. The radiomics quality score (RQS) and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) were utilized for the quality assessment of included studies. Overall sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated to assess diagnostic accuracy. The subgroup analysis and Spearman’s correlation coefficient was done for exploration of heterogeneity sources. Results Fifteen studies with 7,010 GC patients were included. We conducted analyses on both radiomics signature and combined (based on signature and clinical features) models. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, DOR, and AUC of radiomics models compared to combined models were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.67–0.82) versus 0.81 (95% CI, 0.75–0.86), 0.80 (95% CI, 0.73–0.86) versus 0.85 (95% CI, 0.79–0.89), 13 (95% CI, 7–23) versus 23 (95% CI, 13–42), and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.81–0.86) versus 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87–0.92), respectively. The meta-analysis indicated a significant heterogeneity among studies. The subgroup analysis revealed that arterial phase CT scan, tumoral and nodal regions of interest (ROIs), automatic segmentation, and two-dimensional (2D) ROI could improve diagnostic accuracy compared to venous phase CT scan, tumoral-only ROI, manual segmentation, and 3D ROI, respectively. Overall, the quality of studies was quite acceptable based on both QUADAS-2 and RQS tools. Conclusion CT scan–based radiomics approach has a promising potential for the prediction of LNM in GC patients preoperatively as a non-invasive diagnostic tool.

Although it is believed that evaluating the structural and functional remodeling of the left atrium (LA) may be helpful in predicting AF recurrence, there is a lack of consensus on prediction accuracy. Ultrasound-based radiomics is currently receiving increasing attention because it might aid in the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of AF recurrence. However, research on LA ultrasound radiomics is limited. Objective We aim to investigate the incremental predictive utility of LA radiomics and construct a radiomics nomogram to preoperatively predict AF recurrence following CA. Methods A training cohort of 232 AF patients was designed for nomogram construction, while a validation cohort ( n = 100) served as the model performance test. AF recurrence during a follow-up period of 3–12 months was defined as the endpoint. The radiomics features related to AF recurrence were extracted and selected to create the radiomics score (rad score). These rad scores, along with other morphological and functional indicators for AF recurrence, were included in the multivariate Cox analysis to establish a nomogram for the prediction of the likelihood of AF recurrence within 1 year following CA. Results In the training and validation cohorts, AF recurrence rates accounted for 32.3% (75/232) and 25.0% (25/100), respectively. We extracted seven types of radiomics features associated with AF recurrence from apical four-chamber view echocardiography images and established a rad score for each patient. The radiomics nomogram was built with the rad score, AF type, left atrial appendage emptying flow velocity, and peak atrial longitudinal strain. It outperformed the nomogram building without the rad score in terms of the predictive efficacy of CA outcome and showed favorable performance in both cohorts. Conclusion We revealed the incremental utility of a radiomics signature in the prediction of AF recurrence and preliminarily developed and validated a radiomics nomogram for identifying patients who were at high risk of post-CA recurrence, which contributed to an appropriate management strategy for AF.","Dongyan Zheng,Yueli Zhang,Dong Huang,Man Wang,Ning Guo,Shu Zhu,Juanjuan Zhang,Tao Ying",,2023.0

This study introduces a novel physics-informed discretization (PID) method for reproducible radiomic feature extraction and evaluates its performance using quantitative MRI sequences including magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping. Materials and Methods A multiscanner, scan-rescan dataset comprising whole-brain 3D quantitative (MRF T1, MRF T2, and ADC) and weighted MRI (T1w MPRAGE, T2w SPACE, and T2w FLAIR) from 5 healthy subjects was prospectively acquired. Subjects underwent 2 repeated acquisitions on 3 distinct 3 T scanners each, for a total of 6 scans per subject (30 total scans). First-order statistical (n = 23) and second-order texture (n = 74) radiomic features were extracted from 56 brain tissue regions of interest using the proposed PID method (for quantitative MRI) and conventional fixed bin number (FBN) discretization (for quantitative MRI and weighted MRI). Interscanner radiomic feature reproducibility was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and the effect of image sequence (eg, MRF T1 vs T1w MPRAGE), as well as image discretization method (ie, PID vs FBN), on radiomic feature reproducibility was assessed using repeated measures analysis of variance. The robustness of PID and FBN discretization to segmentation error was evaluated by simulating segmentation differences in brainstem regions of interest. Radiomic features with ICCs greater than 0.75 following simulated segmentation were determined to be robust to segmentation. Results First-order features demonstrated higher reproducibility in quantitative MRI than weighted MRI sequences, with 30% (n = 7/23) features being more reproducible in MRF T1 and MRF T2 than weighted MRI. Gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features extracted from MRF T1 and MRF T2 were significantly more reproducible using PID compared with FBN discretization; for all quantitative MRI sequences, PID yielded the highest number of texture features with excellent reproducibility (ICC &gt; 0.9). Comparing texture reproducibility of quantitative and weighted MRI, a greater proportion of MRF T1 (n = 225/370, 61%) and MRF T2 (n = 150/370, 41%) texture features had excellent reproducibility (ICC &gt; 0.9) compared with T1w MPRAGE (n = 148/370, 40%), ADC (n = 115/370, 32%), T2w SPACE (n = 98/370, 27%), and FLAIR (n = 102/370, 28%). Physics-informed discretization was also more robust than FBN discretization to segmentation error, as 46% (n = 103/222, 46%) of texture features extracted from quantitative MRI using PID were robust to simulated 6 mm segmentation shift compared with 19% (n = 42/222, 19%) of weighted MRI texture features extracted using FBN discretization. Conclusions The proposed PID method yields radiomic features extracted from quantitative MRI sequences that are more reproducible and robust than radiomic features extracted from weighted MRI using conventional (FBN) discretization approaches. Quantitative MRI sequences also demonstrated greater scan-rescan robustness and first-order feature reproducibility than weighted MRI.","Walter Zhao,Zheyuan Hu,Anahita Fathi Kazerooni,Gregor Körzdörfer,Mathias Nittka,Christos Davatzikos,Satish Viswanath,Xiaofeng Wang,Chaitra Badve,Dan Ma",,2023.0

We hypothesize that the local immune micro-environment of NSCLC is associated with patient outcomes and that these local immune features exhibit distinct radiologic characteristics discernible by quantitative imaging metrics. We assembled two cohorts of NSCLC patients treated with definitive surgical resection and extracted quantitative parameters from pretreatment CT imaging. The excised primary tumors were then quantified for percent tumor PDL1 expression and density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (via CD3 count) utilizing immunohistochemistry and automated cell counting. Associating these pretreatment radiomics parameters with tumor immune parameters, we developed an immune pathology-informed model (IPIM) that separated patients into 4 clusters (designated A-D) utilizing 4 radiomics features. The IPIM designation was significantly associated with overall survival in both training (5 year OS: 61%, 41%, 50%, and 91%, for clusters A-D, respectively, P=0.04) and validation (5 year OS: 55%, 72%, 75%, and 86%, for clusters A-D, respectively, P=0.002) cohorts and immune pathology (all P<0.05). Specifically, we identified a favorable outcome group characterized by low CT intensity and high heterogeneity that exhibited low PDL1 and high CD3 infiltration, suggestive of a favorable immune activated state. We have developed a NSCLC radiomics signature based on the immune micro-environment and patient outcomes. This manuscript demonstrates model creation and validation in independent cohorts.","Chad Tang,Chad Tang,Brian P. Hobbs,Brian P. Hobbs,Ahmed M. Amer,Ahmed M.

10.1002/jmri.25939,,,Differentiation between vasogenic edema and infiltrative tumor in patients with high-grade gliomas using texture patch-based analysis.,"BACKGROUND: High-grade gliomas (HGGs) induce both vasogenic edema and extensive infiltration of tumor cells, both of which present with similar appearance on conventional MRI. Using current radiological criteria, differentiation between these tumoral and nontumoral areas within the nonenhancing lesion area remains challenging. PURPOSE: To use radiomics patch-based analysis, based on conventional MRI, for the classification of the nonenhancing lesion area in patients with HGG into tumoral and nontumoral components. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. SUBJECTS: In all, 179 MRI scans were obtained from 102 patients: 67 patients with HGG and 35 patients with brain metastases. A subgroup of 15 patients with HGG were scanned before and following administration of bevacizumab. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Pre and postcontrast agent T1 -weighted-imaging (WI), T2 WI, FLAIR, diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI), and dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI at 3T. ASSESSMENT: A total of 225 histograms and gray-level-co-occurrence matrix-based features were extracted from the nonenhancing lesion area. Tumoral volumes of interest (VOIs) were defined at the peritumoral area in patients with HGG; nontumoral VOIs were defined in patients with brain metastasis. Twenty machine-learning algorithms including support-vector-machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor, decision-trees, and ensemble classifiers were tested. The best classifier was trained on the entire labeled data, and was used to classify the entire data. STATISTICAL TESTS: Dimensional reduction was performed on the 225 features using principal component analysis. Classification results were evaluated based on the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each of the 20 classifiers, first based on a training and testing dataset (80% of the labeled data) in a 5-fold manner, and next by applying the best classifier to the validation data (the remaining 20% of the labeled data). Results were additionally evaluated by assessing differences in dynamic-contrast-enhanced plasma-volume (vp ) and volume-transfer-constant (ktrans ) values between the two components using Mann-Whitney U-test/t-test. RESULTS: The best classification into tumoral and nontumoral lesion components was obtained using a linear SVM classifier, with average accuracy of 87%, sensitivity 86%, and specificity of 89% (for the training and testing data). Significantly higher vp and ktrans values (P < 0.0001) were detected in the tumoral compared to the nontumoral component. Preliminary classification results in a subgroup of patients treated with bevacizumab demonstrated a reduction mainly in the nontumoral component following administration of bevacizumab, enabling early assessment of disease progression in some patients. DATA CONCLUSION: A radiomics patch-based analysis enables classification of the nonenhancing lesion area in patients with HGG. Preliminary results were promising and the proposed method has the potential to assist in clinical decision-making and to improve therapy response assessment in patients with HGG.

In these cases, simple visual examination of medical images of the metastases is not enough to identify the primary cancer, so an extensive evaluation is needed. To avoid this procedure, a radiomics approach on magnetic resonance (MR) images of the metastatic lesions is proposed to classify two of the most frequent origins (lung cancer and melanoma). In this study, 50 T1-weighted MR images of brain metastases from 30 patients were analyzed: 27 of lung cancer and 23 of melanoma origin. A total of 43 statistical texture features were extracted from the segmented lesions in 2D and 3D. Five predictive models were evaluated using a nested cross-validation scheme. The best classification results were achieved using 3D texture features for all the models, obtaining an average AUC > 0.9 in all cases and an AUC = 0.947 ± 0.067 when using the best model (naive Bayes).","Rafael Ortiz-Ramón,Andrés Larroza,Rafael Ortiz-Ramon,Estanislao Arana,Andrés Larroza,David Moratal,Estanislao Arana,David Moratal",,2017.0

While both types of features have shown to be promising predictors of prognosis, the association between these groups of features remains unclear. We investigated the associations between semantic and radiomic features in CT images of 258 non-small cell lung adenocarcinomas. The tumor imaging phenotypes were described using 9 qualitative semantic features that were scored by radiologists, and 57 quantitative radiomic features that were automatically calculated using mathematical algorithms. Of the 9 semantic features, 3 were rated on a binary scale (cavitation, air bronchogram, and calcification) and 6 were rated on a categorical scale (texture, border definition, contour, lobulation, spiculation, and concavity). 32–41 radiomic features were associated with the binary semantic features (AUC=0.56–0.76). The relationship between all radiomic features and the categorical semantic features ranged from weak to moderate (|Spearmen’s correlation|=0.002–0.65). There are associations between semantic and radiomic features, however the associations were not strong despite being significant. Our results indicate that radiomic features may capture distinct tumor phenotypes that fail to be perceived by naked eye that semantic features do not describe and vice versa.","Stephen Yip,Ying Liu,S Yip,Stephen S.F.

AI algorithms, which excel in quantifying complex patterns in data, have shown remarkable progress in applications ranging from self-driving cars to speech recognition. The AI application within radiology, known as radiomics, can provide detailed quantifications of the radiographic characteristics of underlying tissues. This information can be used throughout the clinical care path to improve diagnosis and treatment planning, as well as assess treatment response. This tremendous potential for clinical translation has led to a vast increase in the number of research studies being conducted in the field, a number that is expected to rise sharply in the future. Many studies have reported robust and meaningful findings; however, a growing number also suffer from flawed experimental or analytic designs. Such errors could not only result in invalid discoveries, but also may lead others to perpetuate similar flaws in their own work.

While the identification of stable texture features under varying imaging settings is crucial for the translation of radiomics analysis into routine clinical practice, we hypothesize in this work that a complementary optimization of image acquisition parameters prior to texture feature extraction could enhance the predictive performance of texture-based radiomic models. As a proof of concept, we evaluated the possibility of enhancing a model constructed for the early prediction of lung metastases in soft-tissue sarcomas by optimizing PET and MR image acquisition protocols via computerized simulations of image acquisitions with varying parameters. Simulated PET images from 30 STS patients were acquired by varying the extent of axial data combined per slice ('span'). Simulated T 1-weighted and T 2-weighted MR images were acquired by varying the repetition time and echo time in a spin-echo pulse sequence, respectively. We analyzed the impact of the variations of PET and MR image acquisition parameters on individual textures, and we investigated how these variations could enhance the global response and the predictive properties of a texture-based model. Our results suggest that it is feasible to identify an optimal set of image acquisition parameters to improve prediction performance. The model constructed with textures extracted from simulated images acquired with a standard clinical set of acquisition parameters reached an average AUC of [Formula: see text] in bootstrap testing experiments. In comparison, the model performance significantly increased using an optimal set of image acquisition parameters ([Formula: see text]), with an average AUC of [Formula: see text]. Ultimately, specific acquisition protocols optimized to generate superior radiomics measurements for a given clinical problem could be developed and standardized via dedicated computer simulations and thereafter validated using clinical scanners.","Martin Vallières,Martin Vallières,S.

10.1002/mp.12188,,,On the impact of smoothing and noise on robustness of CT and CBCT radiomics features for patients with head and neck cancers.,"Purpose We investigated the characteristics of radiomics features extracted from planning CT (pCT) and cone beam CT (CBCT) image datasets acquired for 18 oropharyngeal cancer patients treated with fractionated radiation therapy. Images were subjected to smoothing, sharpening, and noise to evaluate changes in features relative to baseline datasets. Methods Textural features were extracted from tumor volumes, contoured on pCT and CBCT images, according to the following 8 different classes: Intensity Based Histogram Features (IBHF), Gray Level Run Length (GLRL), Law's Textural information (LAWS), Discrete Orthonormal Stockwell Transform (DOST), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Two-Dimensional Wavelet Transform (2DWT), Two Dimensional Gabor Filter (2DGF), and Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM). A total of 165 radiomics features were extracted. Images were post-processed prior to feature extraction using a Gaussian noise model with different signal-to-noise-ratios (SNR= 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 50, 75, 100, and 150). Gaussian filters with different cut off frequencies (varied discreetly from 0.0458 to 0.7321 cycles-mm−1) were applied to image datasets. Effect of noise and smoothing on each extracted feature was quantified using mean absolute percent change (MAPC) between the respective values on post-processed and baseline images. The Fisher method for combining Welch p-values was used for tests of significance. Three comparisons were investigated: 1- Baseline pCT versus modified pCT (with given filter applied); 2- Baseline CBCT versus modified CBCT, and 3- Baseline and modified pCT versus baseline and modified CBCT. Results Features extracted from CT and CBCT image datasets were robust to low-pass filtering (MAPC=17.5%, pvalFisher¯ = 0.93 for CBCT and MAPC=7.5%, pvalFisher¯ = 0.98 for pCT) and noise (MAPC=27.1%, pvalFisher¯ = 0.89 for CBCT, and MAPC=34.6%, pvalFisher¯ =0.61 for pCT). Extracted features were significantly impacted (MAPC=187.7%, pvalFisher¯ < 0.0001 for CBCT, and MAPC=180.6%, pvalFisher¯ < 0.0001 for pCT) by LOG which is classified as a high-pass filter. Features most impacted by low pass filtering were LAWS (MAPC=11.2%, pvalFisher¯ = 0.44), GLRL (MAPC=9.7%, pvalFisher¯ = 0.70) and IBHF (MAPC=21.7%, pvalFisher¯ =0.83), for the pCT datasets, and LAWS (MAPC=20.2%, pvalFisher¯ = 0.24), GLRL (MAPC=14.5%, pvalFisher¯ = 0.44), and 2DGF (MAPC=16.3%, pvalFisher¯ = 0.52), for CBCT image datasets. For pCT datasets, features most impacted by noise were GLRL (MAPC=29.7%, pvalFisher¯ = 0.06), LAWS (MAPC=96.6%, pvalFisher¯ = 0.42), and GLCM (MAPC=36.2%, pvalFisher¯ = 0.48), while the LBPF (MAPC=5.2%, pvalFisher¯ = 0.99) was found to be relatively insensitive to noise. For CBCT datasets, GLRL (MAPC=8.9%, pvalFisher¯ = 0.80) and LAWS (MAPC=89.3%, pvalFisher¯ = 0.81) features were impacted by noise, while the LBPF (MAPC=2.2%, pvalFisher¯ = 0.99) and DOST (MAPC=13.7%, pvalFisher¯ = 0.98) features were noise insensitive. Apart from 15 features, no significant differences were observed for the remaining 150 textural features extracted from baseline pCT and CBCT image datasets (MAPC=90.1%, pvalFisher¯ = 0.26). Conclusions Radiomics features extracted from planning CT and daily CBCT image datasets for head/neck cancer patients were robust to low-power Gaussian noise and low-pass filtering, but were impacted by high-pass filtering. Textural features extracted from CBCT and pCT image datasets were similar, suggesting interchangeability of pCT and CBCT for investigating radiomics features as possible biomarkers for outcome.

Currently, the assessment of tumor grade follows surgical resection and histopathologic review. Reliable techniques for pre-operative determination of tumor grade may enhance clinical decision-making.A total of 175 meningioma patients (103 low-grade and 72 high-grade) with pre-operative contrast-enhanced T1-MRI were included. Fifteen radiomic (quantitative) and 10 semantic (qualitative) features were applied to quantify the imaging phenotype. Area under the curve (AUC) and odd ratios (OR) were computed with multiple-hypothesis correction. Random-forest classifiers were developed and validated on an independent dataset (n = 44).Twelve radiographic features (eight radiomic and four semantic) were significantly associated with meningioma grade. High-grade tumors exhibited necrosis/hemorrhage (ORsem = 6.6, AUCrad = 0.62-0.68), intratumoral heterogeneity (ORsem = 7.9, AUCrad = 0.65), non-spherical shape (AUCrad = 0.61), and larger volumes (AUCrad = 0.69) compared to low-grade tumors. Radiomic and sematic classifiers could significantly predict meningioma grade (AUCsem = 0.76 and AUCrad = 0.78). Furthermore, combining them increased the classification power (AUCradio = 0.86). Clinical variables alone did not effectively predict tumor grade (AUCclin = 0.65) or show complementary value with imaging data (AUCcomb = 0.84).We found a strong association between imaging features of meningioma and histopathologic grade, with ready application to clinical management. Combining qualitative and quantitative radiographic features significantly improved classification power.","Thibaud Coroller,Thibaud P.

To facilitate potential biomedical application of DTN, fundamental understanding of the biological properties of DTN in animals becomes increasingly important. In this study, we aim to investigate the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of DTN in animals and apply DTN for kidney function evaluation in healthy mice and mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO).   Methods:   DTN with 4 side-arms was assembled through a one-step annealing process and characterized using gel electrophoresis. After hybridization with Dylight755-ssDNA or 64Cu-NOTA-ssDNA, Dylight755-DTN or 64Cu-DTN was then applied for fluorescent imaging and dynamic PET imaging of healthy mice. A murine model of UUO was prepared by surgically ligating the left ureter. Dynamic PET imaging of UUO mice using 64Cu-DTN was performed to not only validate but also quantify the renal clearance and biodistribution of DTN in vivo.   Results:   Dylight755-DTN and 64Cu-DTN could be well prepared and characterized. Fluorescent imaging revealed the efficient renal clearance of DTN in healthy mice, and dynamic PET imaging confirmed that a majority of DTN undertook urine excretion and accumulated in the bladder. Dynamic PET imaging of UUO mice presented distinct uptake patterns and transportation kinetics of DTN in the obstructed and contralateral kidneys. After analyzing the time-activity curve of kidneys based on PET imaging, we were able to systematically compare the renal perfusion and excretion speed of kidneys in healthy mice and mice with UUO in a non-invasive manner. Conclusion: With Dylight755-DTN for fluorescent imaging and 64Cu-DTN for PET imaging, real-time and quantitative biological understanding of DTN in animals was established. Efficient renal clearance of DTN further enabled kidney function evaluation of mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction, allowing for the correlate renal dysfunction with the changes of the renal time-activity curve in vivo.","Martin Vallières,Issam El Naqa,Martin Vallières,Alex Zwanenburg,Martin Vallieres,Alex Zwanenburg,Alex Zwanenburg,Bogdan Badic,Bodgan Badic,Catherine Cheze Le Rest,Dimitris Visvikis,Catherine Cheze Le Rest,Dimitris Visvikis,Mathieu Hatt,Mathieu Hatt",The Journal of Nuclear Medicine,2017.0
10.1158/0008-5472.can-17-0122,28566328.0,,Somatic Mutations Drive Distinct Imaging Phenotypes in Lung Cancer.,"Tumors are characterized by somatic mutations that drive biological processes ultimately reflected in tumor phenotype. With regard to radiographic phenotypes, generally unconnected through present understanding to the presence of specific mutations, artificial intelligence methods can automatically quantify phenotypic characters by using predefined, engineered algorithms or automatic deep-learning methods, a process also known as radiomics. Here we demonstrate how imaging phenotypes can be connected to somatic mutations through an integrated analysis of independent datasets of 763 lung adenocarcinoma patients with somatic mutation testing and engineered CT image analytics. We developed radiomic signatures capable of distinguishing between tumor genotypes in a discovery cohort ( n  = 353) and verified them in an independent validation cohort ( n  = 352). All radiomic signatures significantly outperformed conventional radiographic predictors (tumor volume and maximum diameter). We found a radiomic signature related to radiographic heterogeneity that successfully discriminated between EGFR +  and EGFR −  cases (AUC = 0.69). Combining this signature with a clinical model of EGFR status (AUC = 0.70) significantly improved prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.75). The highest performing signature was capable of distinguishing between EGFR +  and KRAS +  tumors (AUC = 0.80) and, when combined with a clinical model (AUC = 0.81), substantially improved its performance (AUC = 0.86). A KRAS + /KRAS −  radiomic signature also showed significant albeit lower performance (AUC = 0.63) and did not improve the accuracy of a clinical predictor of KRAS status. Our results argue that somatic mutations drive distinct radiographic phenotypes that can be predicted by radiomics. This work has implications for the use of imaging-based biomarkers in the clinic, as applied noninvasively, repeatedly, and at low cost.

10.1093/jnci/djx055,28423406.0,,The Rise of Radiomics and Implications for Oncologic Management.,"Abstract Clinical medicine, particularly oncology, is progressing toward personalized care. Whereas the terms genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics have dominated personalized medicine for the past couple decades, the concept of radiomics was first described in 2012. This nascent concept has major implications for personalized cancer care and involves extracting hundreds of standardized and quantifiable imaging characteristics from diagnostic computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging images. The central hypothesis of radiomics is that these libraries of quantitative individual voxel-based variables are more sensitively associated with various clinical endpoints compared with the more qualitative radiologic, histopathologic, and clinical data more commonly utilized today. Because radiomics offers immense potential but has not reached a mainstream oncologic audience, the authors discuss herein the role of radiomics in cancer care in the future.","Vivek Verma,Vivek Verma,Vivek Verma,Charles B.

Therefore, we propose a full-resolution residual convolutional neural network (FRRN) for brain tumor segmentation and examine the principle of Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout for uncertainty quantification by focusing on the Dropout position and rate. We further feed the resulting brain tumor segmentation into a survival prediction model, which is built on age and a subset of 26 image-derived geometrical features such as volume, volume ratios, surface, surface irregularity and statistics of the enhancing tumor rim width. The results show comparable segmentation performance between MC Dropout models and a standard weight scaling Dropout model. A qualitative evaluation further suggests that informative uncertainty can be obtained by applying MC Dropout after each convolution layer. For survival prediction, results suggest only using few features besides age. In the BraTS17 challenge, our method achieved the 2nd place in the survival task and completed the segmentation task in the 3rd best-performing cluster of statistically different approaches.","Alain Jungo,Richard McKinley,Alain Jungo,Richard McKinley,Raphael Meier,Raphael Meier,Urspeter Knecht,Urspeter Knecht,Luis Fernando Zhinin Vera,Julián Pérez-Beteta,Luis Vera,David Molina-García,David Molina,Julián Pérez-Beteta,Vı́ctor M.

10.1038/s41598-018-36938-4,30679599.0,,Assessing robustness of radiomic features by image perturbation,"Image features need to be robust against differences in positioning, acquisition and segmentation to ensure reproducibility. Radiomic models that only include robust features can be used to analyse new images, whereas models with non-robust features may fail to predict the outcome of interest accurately. Test-retest imaging is recommended to assess robustness, but may not be available for the phenotype of interest. We therefore investigated 18 combinations of image perturbations to determine feature robustness, based on noise addition (N), translation (T), rotation (R), volume growth/shrinkage (V) and supervoxel-based contour randomisation (C). Test-retest and perturbation robustness were compared for combined total of 4032 morphological, statistical and texture features that were computed from the gross tumour volume in two cohorts with computed tomography imaging: I) 31 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; II): 19 head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Robustness was determined using the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the intraclass correlation coefficient (1, 1). Features with CI≥0:90 were considered robust. The NTCV, TCV, RNCV and RCV perturbation chain produced similar results and identified the fewest false positive robust features (NSCLC: 0.2–0.9%; HNSCC: 1.7–1.9%). Thus, these perturbation chains may be used as an alternative to test-retest imaging to assess feature robustness.","Alex Zwanenburg,Alex Zwanenburg,Stefan Leger,Linda Agolli,Karoline Pilz,K.

10.1109/msp.2019.2900993,,,From Hand-Crafted to Deep Learning-based Cancer Radiomics: Challenges and Opportunities.,"Recent advancements in signal processing (SP) and machine learning, coupled with electronic medical record keeping in hospitals and the availability of extensive sets of medical images through internal/external communication systems, have resulted in a recent surge of interest in radiomics.  Radiomics , an emerging and relatively new research field, refers to extracting semiquantitative and/or quantitative features from medical images with the goal of developing predictive and/or prognostic models. In the near future, it is expected to be a critical component for integrating image-derived information used for personalized treatment. The conventional radiomics workflow is typically based on extracting predesigned features (also referred to as  handcrafted  or  engineered features ) from a segmented region of interest (ROI). Nevertheless, recent advancements in deep learning have inspired trends toward deep-learning-based radiomics (DLRs) (also referred to as  discovery radiomics ). In addition to the advantages of these two approaches, there are also hybrid solutions that exploit the potential of multiple data sources. Considering the variety of approaches to radiomics, further improvements require a comprehensive and integrated sketch, which is the goal of this article. This article provides a unique interdisciplinary perspective on radiomics by discussing state-of-the-art SP solutions in the context of radiomics.","Parnian Afshar,Arash Mohammadi,Konstantinos N.

10.1109/jbhi.2018.2841992,29993591.0,,Pattern Classification for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors by Integration of Radiomics and Deep Convolutional Features,"Predicting malignant potential is one of the most critical components of a computer-aided diagnosis system for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). These tumors have been studied only on the basis of subjective computed tomography findings. Among various methodologies, radiomics, and deep learning algorithms, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have recently been confirmed to achieve significant success by outperforming the state-of-the-art performance in medical image pattern classification and have rapidly become leading methodologies in this field. However, the existing methods generally use radiomics or deep convolutional features independently for pattern classification, which tend to take into account only global or local features, respectively. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a hybrid structure that includes different features selected with radiomics model and CNNs and integrates these features to deal with GISTs classification. The Radiomics model and CNNs are constructed for global radiomics and local convolutional feature selection, respectively. Subsequently, we utilize distinct radiomics and deep convolutional features to perform pattern classification for GISTs. Specifically, we propose a new pooling strategy to assemble the deep convolutional features of 54 three-dimensional patches from the same case and integrate these features with the radiomics features for independent case, followed by random forest classifier. Our method can be extensively evaluated using multiple clinical datasets. The classification performance (area under the curve (AUC): 0.882; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.816–0.947) consistently outperforms those of independent radiomics (AUC: 0.807; 95% CI: 0.724–0.892) and CNNs (AUC: 0.826; 95% CI: 0.795–0.856) approaches.","Zhenyuan Ning,Zhenyuan Ning,Zhenyuan Ning,Jiaxiu Luo,Jiaxiu Luo,Yong Li,Yong Li,Shuai Han,Yong Li,Yong Li,Shuai Han,Qianjin Feng,Yu Xu,Qianjin Feng,Yikai Xu,Wufan Chen,Yikai Xu,Tao Chen,Wufan Chen,Yu Zhang,Tao Chen,Yu Zhang,Yu Zhang",IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,2019.0
10.1002/jmri.26224,30171822.0,,Preoperative prediction of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer by radiomic signatures from dynamic contrast‐enhanced MRI,"BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is an important prognostic factor for patients with breast cancer, which is currently determined in clinical practice by invasive SLN biopsy. PURPOSE: To noninvasively predict SLN metastasis in breast cancer using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) intra- and peritumoral radiomics features combined with or without clinicopathologic characteristics of the primary tumor. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: A total of 163 breast cancer patients (55 positive SLN and 108 negative SLN). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5T, T1 -weighted DCE-MRI. ASSESSMENT: A total of 590 radiomic features were extracted for each patient from both intratumoral and peritumoral regions of interest. To avoid overfitting, the dataset was randomly separated into a training set (∼67%) and a validation set (∼33%). The prediction models were built with the training set using logistic regression on the most significant radiomic features in the training set combined with or without clinicopathologic characteristics. The prediction performance was further evaluated in the independent validation set. STATISTICAL TESTS: Mann-Whitney U-test, Spearman correlation, least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) regression, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were performed. RESULTS: Combining radiomic features with clinicopathologic characteristics, six features were automatically selected in the training set to establish the prediction model of SLN metastasis. In the independent validation set, the area under ROC curve (AUC) was 0.869 (NPV=0.886). Using radiomic features alone in the same procedure, 4 features were selected and the validation set AUC was 0.806 (NPV=0.824). DATA CONCLUSION: This is the first attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of using DCE-MRI radiomics to predict SLN metastasis in breast cancer. Clinicopathologic characteristics improved the prediction performance. This study provides noninvasive methods to evaluate SLN status for guiding further treatment of breast cancer patients, and can potentially benefit those with negative SLN, by eliminating unnecessary invasive lymph node removal and the associated complications, which is a step further towards precision medicine.

Radiomics may offer a noninvasive way for predicting the stage of LNM. PURPOSE: To evaluate a radiomic signature of LN involvement based on sagittal T1 contrast-enhanced (CE) and T2 MRI sequences. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: In all, 143 patients were randomly divided into two primary and validation cohorts with 100 patients in the primary cohort and 43 patients in the validation cohort. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: T1 CE and T2 MRI sequences at 3T. ASSESSMENT: The gold standard of LN status was based on histologic results. A radiologist with 10 years of experience used the ITK-SNAP software for 3D manual segmentation. A senior radiologist with 15 years of experience validated all segmentations. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC AUC), classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used between LNM and non-LNM groups. STATISTICAL TESTS: A total of 970 radiomic features and seven clinical characteristics were extracted. Minimum redundancy / maximum relevance and support vector machine algorithms were applied to select features and construct a radiomic signature. The Mann-Whitney U-test and the chi-square test were used to test the performance of clinical characteristics and potential prognostic outcomes. The results were used to assess the quantitative discrimination performance of the SVM-based radiomic signature. RESULTS: The radiomic signatures allowed good discrimination between LNM and non-LNM groups.

Data of 230 consecutive patients were retrospectively analyzed (154 in the training set and 76 in the test set). A total of 1576 radiomics features were extracted from arterial-phase CT images of the whole primary tumor. LASSO logistic regression was performed to choose the key features and construct a radiomics signature. A radiomics nomogram incorporating this signature was developed on the basis of multivariable analysis in the training set. Nomogram performance was determined and validated with respect to its discrimination, calibration and reclassification. Clinical usefulness was estimated by decision curve analysis. The radiomics signature including five features was significantly associated with LN metastasis. The radiomics nomogram, which incorporated the signature and CT-reported LN status (i.e. size criteria), distinguished LN metastasis with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.758 in the training set, and performance was similar in the test set (AUC 0.773). Discrimination of the radiomics nomogram exceeded that of size criteria alone in both the training set (p <0.001) and the test set (p=0.005). Integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and categorical net reclassification improvement (NRI) showed significant improvement in prognostic value when the radiomics signature was added to size criteria in the test set (IDI 17.3%; p<0.001; categorical NRI 52.3%; p<0.001). Decision curve analysis supported that the radiomics nomogram is superior to size criteria.

Of all patients receiving EBRT, 15–35% will experience biochemical recurrence (BCR) within five years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly acquired as part of the diagnostic procedure and imaging-derived features have shown promise in tumour characterisation and biochemical recurrence prediction. We investigated the value of imaging features extracted from pre-treatment T2w anatomical MRI to predict five year biochemical recurrence in high-risk patients treated with EBRT.    Materials and methods  In a cohort of 120 high-risk patients, imaging features were extracted from the whole-prostate and a margin surrounding it. Intensity, shape and textural features were extracted from the original and filtered T2w-MRI scans. The minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance algorithm was used for feature selection. Random forest and logistic regression classifiers were used in our experiments. The performance of a logistic regression model using the patient’s clinical features was also investigated. To assess the prediction accuracy we used stratified 10-fold cross validation and receiver operating characteristic analysis, quantified by the area under the curve (AUC).    Results  A logistic regression model built using whole-prostate imaging features obtained an AUC of 0.63 in the prediction of BCR, outperforming a model solely based on clinical variables (AUC=0.51). Combining imaging and clinical features did not outperform the accuracy of imaging alone.    Conclusions  These results illustrate the potential of imaging features alone to distinguish patients with an increased risk of recurrence, even in a clinically homogeneous cohort.","C.

Complete response after chemoradiation is an accurate surrogate for long-term local control. Predicting complete response from pre-treatment features could represent a major step towards conservative treatment. Patients with a T2-4 N0-1 rectal adenocarcinoma treated between June 2010 and October 2016 with neo-adjuvant chemoradiation from three academic institutions were included. All clinical and treatment data was integrated in our clinical data warehouse, from which we extracted the features. Radiomics features were extracted from the tumor volume from the treatment planning CT Scan. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) was created to predict complete response, as a methodological proof-of-principle. The results were compared to a baseline Linear Regression model using only the TNM stage as a predictor and a second model created with Support Vector Machine on the same features used in the DNN. Ninety-five patients were included in the final analysis. There were 49 males (52%) and 46 females (48%). Median tumour size was 48mm (15–130). Twenty-two patients (23%) had pathologic complete response after chemoradiation. One thousand six hundred eighty-three radiomics features were extracted. The DNN predicted complete response with an 80% accuracy, which was better than the Linear Regression model (69.5%) and the SVM model (71.58%). Our model correctly predicted complete response after neo-adjuvant rectal chemoradiotherapy in 80% of the patients of this multicenter cohort. Our results may help to identify patients who would benefit from a conservative treatment, rather than a radical resection.","Jean‐Emmanuel Bibault,P. Giraud,Jean-Emmanuel Bibault,Philippe Giraud,M.

10.1016/j.ebiom.2018.07.029,30078735.0,,Development and Validation of an MRI-Based Radiomics Signature for the Preoperative Prediction of Lymph Node Metastasis in Bladder Cancer,"Abstract   Background  Preoperative lymph node (LN) status is important for the treatment of bladder cancer (BCa). However, a proportion of patients are at high risk for inaccurate clinical nodal staging by current methods. Here, we report an accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics signature for the individual preoperative prediction of LN metastasis in BCa.    Methods  In total, 103 eligible BCa patients were divided into a training set (n=69) and a validation set (n=34). And 718 radiomics features were extracted from the cancerous volumes of interest (VOIs) on T2-weighted MRI images. A radiomics signature was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm in the training set, whose performance was assessed and then validated in the validation set. Stratified analyses were also performed. Based on the multivariable logistic regression analysis, a radiomics nomogram was developed incorporating the radiomics signature and selected clinical predictors. Discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness of the nomogram were assessed.    Findings  Consisting of 9 selected features, the radiomics signature showed a favorable discriminatory ability in the training set with an AUC of 0.9005, which was confirmed in the validation set with an AUC of 0.8447. Encouragingly, the radiomics signature also showed good discrimination in the MRI-reported LN negative (cN0) subgroup (AUC, 0.8406). The nomogram, consisting of the radiomics signature and the MRI-reported LN status, showed good calibration and discrimination in the training and validation sets (AUC, 0.9118 and 0.8902, respectively). The decision curve analysis indicated that the nomogram was clinically useful.    Interpretation  The MRI-based radiomics nomogram has the potential to be used as a non-invasive tool for individualized preoperative prediction of LN metastasis in BCa. External validation is further required prior to clinical implementation.","Shaoxu Wu,Shaoxu Wu,Junjiong Zheng,Junjiong Zheng,Yong Li,Yong Li,Zhuo Wu,Zhuo Wu,Zhuo Wu,Siya Shi,Ming Huang,Siya Shi,Ming Huang,Hao Yu,Wen Dong,Hao Yu,Wen Dong,Jian Huang,Jian Huang,Jian Huang,Jian Huang,Tianxin Lin,Tianxin Lin",EBioMedicine,2018.0

However, hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement, the gold standard for defining CSPH (HVPG≥10mmHg) is invasive and therefore not suitable for routine clinical practice. This study aims to develop and validate a radiomics-based model as a noninvasive method for accurate detection of CSPH in cirrhosis.  The prospective multicenter diagnostic trial (CHESS1701,  ClinicalTrials.gov  identifier:  NCT03138915 ) involved 385 patients with cirrhosis from five liver centers in China between August 2016 and September 2017. Patients who had both HVPG measurement and contrast-enhanced CT within 14days prior to the catheterization were collected. The noninvasive radiomics model, termed rHVPG for CSPH was developed based on CT images in a training cohort consisted of 222 consecutive patients and the diagnostic performance was prospectively assessed in 163 consecutive patients in four external validation cohorts.  rHVPG showed a good performance in detection of CSPH with a C-index of 0·849 (95%CI: 0·786–0·911). Application of rHVPG in four external prospective validation cohorts still gave excellent performance with the C-index of 0·889 (95%CI: 0·752–1·000, 0·800 (95%CI: 0·614–0·986), 0·917 (95%CI: 0·772–1·000), and 0·827 (95%CI: 0·618–1·000), respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients for inter- and intra-observer agreement were 0·92–0·99 and 0·97–0·99, respectively.  A radiomics signature was developed and prospectively validated as an accurate method for noninvasive detection of CSPH in cirrhosis. The tool of rHVPG assessment can facilitate the identification of CSPH rapidly when invasive transjugular procedure is not available.","Fuquan Liu,Zhenyuan Ning,Fuquan Liu,Yanna Liu,Zhenyuan Ning,Zhenyuan Ning,Zhenyuan Ning,Dengxiang Liu,Yanna Liu,Dengxiang Liu,Jie Tian,Jie Tian,Heng Luo,Hongwu Luo,Weimin An,Weimin An,Weimin An,Weimin An,Yifei Huang,Yifei Huang,Yifei Huang,Yifei Huang,Jialiang Zou,Jialiang Zou,Chuan Liu,Chuan Liu,Chuan Liu,Changchun Liu,Changchun Liu,Changchun Liu,Lei Wang,Lei Wang,Lei Wang,Zaiyi Liu,Zaiyi Liu,Zaiyi Liu,Ruizhao Qi,Ruizhao Qi,Ruizhao Qi,Changzeng Zuo,Changzeng Zuo,Qingge Zhang,Qingge Zhang,Jitao Wang,Jitao Wang,Debin Zhao,Dawei Zhao,Yongli Duan,Yongli Duan,Baogang Peng,Baogang Peng,Baogang Peng,Baogang Peng,Baogang Peng,Baogang Peng,Xingshun Qi,Xingshun Qi,Xingshun Qi,Yuening Zhang,Yuening Zhang,Yuening Zhang,Yongping Yang,Yongping Yang,Yongping Yang,Jilun Hou,Jinlin Hou,Jinlin Hou,Jiahong Dong,Jiahong Dong,Zhiwei Li,Zhiwei Li,Zhiwei Li,Huiguo Ding,Huiguo Ding,Yu Zhang,Yu Zhang,Xiaolong Qi,Yu Zhang,Xiaolong Qi",EBioMedicine,2018.0
10.1007/s11060-018-2984-4,,,Diagnostic accuracy of MRI texture analysis for grading gliomas.,"Texture analysis (TA) can quantify variations in surface intensity or patterns, including some that are imperceptible to the human visual system. The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of radiomic based filtration-histogram TA to differentiate high-grade from low-grade gliomas by assessing tumor heterogeneity. Patients with a histopathological diagnosis of glioma and preoperative 3T MRI imaging were included in this retrospective study. A region of interest was manually delineated on post-contrast T1 images. TA was performed using commercially available research software. The histogram parameters including mean, standard deviation, entropy, mean of the positive pixels, skewness, and kurtosis were analyzed at spatial scaling factors ranging from 0 to 6mm. The parameters were correlated with WHO glioma grade using Spearman correlation. Areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated using ROC curve analysis to distinguish tumor grades. Of a total of 94 patients, 14 had low-grade gliomas and 80 had high-grade gliomas. Mean, SD, MPP, entropy and kurtosis each showed significant differences between glioma grades for different spatial scaling filters. Low and high-grade gliomas were best-discriminated using mean of 2mm fine texture scale, with a sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 86% (AUC of 0.90). Quantitative measurement of heterogeneity using TA can discriminate high versus low-grade gliomas. Radiomic data of texture features can provide complementary diagnostic information for gliomas.","Austin Ditmer,Bin Zhang,Austin Ditmer,Taimur Shujaat,Bin Zhang,Bin Zhang,Taimur Shujaat,Andrew A.

10.1186/s13550-018-0379-3,,,Evaluation of prognostic models developed using standardised image features from different PET automated segmentation methods,"Prognosis in oesophageal cancer (OC) is poor. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate is approximately 15%. Personalised medicine is hoped to increase the 5- and 10-year OS rates. Quantitative analysis of PET is gaining substantial interest in prognostic research but requires the accurate definition of the metabolic tumour volume. This study compares prognostic models developed in the same patient cohort using individual PET segmentation algorithms and assesses the impact on patient risk stratification. Consecutive patients (n=427) with biopsy-proven OC were included in final analysis. All patients were staged with PET/CT between September 2010 and July 2016. Nine automatic PET segmentation methods were studied. All tumour contours were subjectively analysed for accuracy, and segmentation methods with <90% accuracy were excluded. Standardised image features were calculated, and a series of prognostic models were developed using identical clinical data. The proportion of patients changing risk classification group were calculated. Out of nine PET segmentation methods studied, clustering means (KM2), general clustering means (GCM3), adaptive thresholding (AT) and watershed thresholding (WT) methods were included for analysis. Known clinical prognostic factors (age, treatment and staging) were significant in all of the developed prognostic models. AT and KM2 segmentation methods developed identical prognostic models. Patient risk stratification was dependent on the segmentation method used to develop the prognostic model with up to 73 patients (17.1%) changing risk stratification group. Prognostic models incorporating quantitative image features are dependent on the method used to delineate the primary tumour. This has a subsequent effect on risk stratification, with patients changing groups depending on the image segmentation method used.","Craig Parkinson,Craig Parkinson,Kieran Foley,Kieran Foley,Philip Whybra,Robert Kerrin Hills,Philip Whybra,Ashley Roberts,Robert Kerrin Hills,Christopher Marshall,Ashley Roberts,John Staffurth,Christopher Marshall,John Staffurth,Emiliano Spezi,Emiliano Spezi",EJNMMI research,2018.0
10.1007/s40336-018-0292-9,,,FDG PET radiomics: a review of the methodological aspects,"To perform an updated review regarding the influence of methodological conditions on radiomics analyses of 18F-FDG PET imaging. We performed a systematic review of the literature using PubMed/Medline and Google scholars, with multiple research keywords for each organ accompanying the terms “radiomics”, “texture”, “heterogeneity”, “FDG”, “PET” and “PET/CT”. The review considers methodological studies for shape, histogram and textural features extracted from FDG PET imaging. The references cited in the retrieved articles were also explored to find additional studies. The search was limited to English language. Preclinical and animal studies were not included in the review. A total of 44 original articles were considered for the review. In the same conditions, repeatability is very variable among the radiomics features in FDG PET. The vast majority of features are sensitive to acquisition and reconstruction settings independently of the category or order of features. Similar sensitivity and variability are observed with respect to respiratory motion, pre-processing, segmentation method, and specifically for textural features, discretisation of grey levels and implementation/parameterisation of texture matrices. Radiomics features are sensitive to almost all factors involved in the PET/CT workflow, from the generation of the images, to the radiomics implementation choices. This strongly supports the need for standardization efforts of these conditions to enable implementation in clinical routine and multicentric studies. However, to date the repercussion of these features fluctuations on the clinical endpoints has been rarely studied. Similar standardization and consensus will also be needed for the statistical analysis and machine learning aspects involved in radiomics analyses of FDG PET images.","Pierre Lovinfosse,Pierre Lovinfosse,Dimitris Visvikis,Pierre Lovinfosse,Roland Hustinx,Dimitris Visvikis,Roland Hustinx,Mathieu Hatt,Mathieu Hatt",Clinical and Translational Imaging,2018.0
10.1002/mp.13100,,,Gold nanoparticle-induced sonosensitization enhances the antitumor activity of ultrasound in colon tumor-bearing mice.,"PURPOSE: As a noninvasive and nonionizing radiation, ultrasound can be focused remotely, transferring acoustic energy deep in the body, thereby addressing the penetration depth barrier of the light-based therapies. In cancer therapy, the effectiveness of ultrasound can be enhanced by utilizing nanomaterials that exhibit sonosensitizing properties called as nanosonosensitizers. The gold nanoparticle (AuNP) has been recently presented as a potent nanosonosensitizer with the potential to simultaneously enhance both the thermal and mechanical interactions of ultrasound with the tissue of the human body. Accordingly, this paper attempts to evaluate the invivo antitumor efficiency of ultrasound in combination with AuNP. METHODS: BALB/c mice-bearing CT26 colorectal tumor model was intraperitoneally injected with AuNPs and then subjected to ultrasound irradiation (1MHz; 2W/cm2 ; 10min) for three sessions. Furthermore, [18 F]FDG (2-deoxy-2-[18 F]fluoro-d-glucose) positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging was performed and the radiomic features from different feature categorizes were extracted to quantify the tumors' phenotype. RESULTS: The tumors were dramatically shrunk and the mice appeared healthy over 21days of study span without the evidence of relapse. The animals treated with AuNP+ultrasound exhibited an obvious decline in tumor metabolic parameters such as standard uptake value (SUV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) compared to other treatment groups. CONCLUSION: These findings support the use of AuNP as a potent sonosensitizing agent with the potential to use the thermal and mechanical effects of ultrasound so as to cause damage to the focused tumor site, resulting in an improved antitumor efficacy.","Jaber Beik,Mohammad Reza Shiran,Jaber Beik,Ziaeddin Abed,Mohammad Bagher Shiran,Ziaeddin Abed,Isaac Shiri,Ali Ghadimi-Daresajini,Isaac Shiri,Forough Farkhondeh,Ali Ghadimi-Daresajini,Habib Ghaznavi,Forough Farkhondeh,Ali Shakeri‐Zadeh,Habib Ghaznavi,Ali Shakeri-Zadeh",Medical Physics,2018.0

10.21037/tau.2018.06.05,30050803.0,,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics for prostate cancer radiotherapy,"In radiotherapy (RT) of prostate cancer, dose escalation has been shown to reduce biochemical failure. Dose escalation only to determinate prostate tumor habitats has the potential to improve tumor control with less toxicity than when the entire prostate is dose escalated. Other issues in the treatment of the RT patient include the choice of the RT technique (hypo- or standard fractionation) and the use and length of concurrent/adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Up to 50% of high-risk men demonstrate biochemical failure suggesting that additional strategies for defining and treating patients based on improved risk stratification are required. The use of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is rapidly gaining momentum in the management of prostate cancer because of its improved diagnostic potential and its ability to combine functional and anatomical information. Currently, the Prostate Imaging, Reporting and Diagnosis System (PIRADS) is the standard of care for region of interest (ROI) identification and risk classification. However, PIRADS was not designed for 3D tumor volume delineation; there is a large degree of subjectivity and PIRADS does not accurately and reproducibly elucidate inter- and intra-lesional spatial heterogeneity. “Radiomics”, as it refers to the extraction and analysis of large number of advanced quantitative radiological features from medical images using high throughput methods, is perfectly suited as an engine to effectively sift through the multiple series of prostate mpMRI sequences and quantify regions of interest. The radiomic efforts can be summarized in two main areas: (I) detection/segmentation of the suspicious lesion; and (II) assessment of the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. As related to RT, the goal of the latter is in particular to identify patients at high risk for metastatic disease; and the aim of the former is to identify and segment cancerous lesions and thus provide targets for radiation boost. The article is structured as follows: first, we describe the radiomic approach; and second, we discuss the radiomic pipeline as tailored for RT of prostate cancer. In this process we summarize the current efforts and progress in integrating mpMRI radiomics into the radiotherapeutic management of prostate cancer with emphasis placed on its role in treatment target definition, treatment plan strategizing, and prognostic assessment. The described concepts, methods and tools are not currently applicable to the radiation oncology practice outside of the research setting. More data are required in the form of clinical trials to assess the robustness of radiomics-based predictive models, and to maximize the efficacy of these models.","Fei Yang,Fei Yang,John C.

We aimed to develop a novel radiomics nomogram based on radiomics features and clinical characteristics that could preoperatively predict early recurrence (ER) of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) after partial hepatectomy. Methods: A predictive model was developed from a training cohort comprising 139 ICC patients diagnosed between January 2010 and June 2014. Radiomics features were extracted from arterial-phase image of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Feature selection and construction of a “radiomics signature” were through Spearman’s rank correlation and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression. Combined with clinical characteristics, a radiomics nomogram was developed with multivariable logistic regression. Performance of the nomogram was evaluated with regard to discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. An independent validation cohort involving 70 patients recruited from July 2014 to March 2016 was used to evaluate the utility of the nomogram developed. Results: The radiomics signature, consisting of nine features, differed significantly between ER patients and non-ER patients in training and validation cohorts. The area under the curve (AUC) of the radiomics signature in training and validation cohorts was 0.82 (confidence interval [CI], 0.74–0.88) and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65–0.86), respectively. The AUC of the radiomics nomogram combining the radiomics signature and clinical stage in the two cohorts was 0.90 (95%CI, 0.83–0.94) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.76–0.93), respectively. Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical usefulness of the radiomics nomogram. Conclusion: The non-invasive radiomics nomogram developed using the radiomics signature and clinical stage could be used to predict ER of ICC after partial hepatectomy.","Wenjie Liang,Wenjie Liang,Lei Xu,Pengfei Yang,Lei Xu,Lei Xu,Lele Zhang,Pengfei Yang,Lele Zhang,Dalong Wan,Qiang Huang,Dalong Wan,Tianye Niu,Qiang Huang,Feng Chen,Tianye Niu,Feng Chen,Feng Chen,Feng Chen,Feng Chen",Frontiers in Oncology,2018.0
10.1053/j.semnuclmed.2018.07.003,30322481.0,,Novel Quantitative PET Techniques for Clinical Decision Support in Oncology,"Quantitative image analysis has deep roots in the usage of positron emission tomography (PET) in clinical and research settings to address a wide variety of diseases. It has been extensively employed to assess molecular and physiological biomarkers in vivo in healthy and disease states, in oncology, cardiology, neurology, and psychiatry. Quantitative PET allows relating the time-varying activity concentration in tissues/organs of interest and the basic functional parameters governing the biological processes being studied. Yet, quantitative PET is challenged by a number of degrading physical factors related to the physics of PET imaging, the limitations of the instrumentation used, and the physiological status of the patient. Moreover, there is no consensus on the most reliable and robust image-derived PET metric(s) that can be used with confidence in clinical oncology owing to the discrepancies between the conclusions reported in the literature. There is also increasing interest in the use of artificial intelligence based techniques, particularly machine learning and deep learning techniques in a variety of applications to extract quantitative features (radiomics) from PET including image segmentation and outcome prediction in clinical oncology. These novel techniques are revolutionizing clinical practice and are now offering unique capabilities to the clinical molecular imaging community and biomedical researchers at large. In this report, we summarize recent developments and future tendencies in quantitative PET imaging and present example applications in clinical decision support to illustrate its potential in the context of clinical oncology.","Habib Zaidi,Abass Alavi,Habib Zaidi,Abass Alavi,Issam El Naqa,Issam El Naqa",Seminars in Nuclear Medicine,2018.0
10.3389/fphy.2018.00051,,,Personalizing Medicine Through Hybrid Imaging and Medical Big Data Analysis,"Medical imaging has evolved from a pure visualization tool to representing a primary source of analytic approaches towards in vivo disease characterization. Hybrid imaging is an integral part of this approach, as it provides complementary visual and quantitative information in the form of morphological and functional insights into the living body. As such, non-invasive imaging modalities no longer provide images only, but data, as stated recently by pioneers in the field. Today, such information, together with other, non-imaging medical data creates highly heterogeneous data sets that underpin the concept of medical big data. While the exponential growth of medical big data challenges their processing, they inherently contain information that benefits a patient-centric personalized healthcare. Novel machine learning approaches combined with high-performance distributed cloud computing technologies help explore medical big data. Such exploration and subsequent generation of knowledge require a profound understanding of the technical challenges. These challenges increase in complexity when employing hybrid, aka dual- or even multi-modality image data as input to big data repositories. This paper provides a general insight into medical big data analysis in light of the use of hybrid imaging information. First, hybrid imaging is introduced (see further contributions to this special Research Topic), also in the context of medical big data, then the technological background of machine learning as well as state-of-the-art distributed cloud computing technologies are presented, followed by the discussion of data preservation and data sharing trends. Joint data exploration endeavours in the context of in vivo radiomics and hybrid imaging will be presented. Standardization challenges of imaging protocol, delineation, feature engineering and machine learning evaluation will be detailed. Last, the paper will provide an outlook into the future role of hybrid imaging in view of personalized medicine, whereby a focus will be given to the derivation of prediction models as part of clinical decision support systems, to which machine learning approaches and hybrid imaging can be anchored.","László Papp,Clemens P.

10.1002/mp.12817,,,Practical data collection and extraction for big data applications in radiotherapy.,"The capture of high-quality treatment data and outcomes is necessary in order to learn from our clinical experiences with big data analytics. In radiotherapy, there are several practical challenges to overcome. Practical aspects of data collection are discussed pointing to a need for a culture change in clinical practice to one that captures structured patient-related data in routine care in a prospective manner. Radiation dosimetry and the contoured anatomy must also be captured routinely to represent the best estimate of delivered radiation. The quality and integrity present in the data are critical which poses opportunities to introduce electronic validity checking to improve them. Similarly, data completeness and methods and technology to improve the efficiency and sufficiency of data capture can be introduced. In the manuscript, the types of clinical data are discussed including patient reports, images, biospecimens, treatments, and symptom management. With a data-driven culture, the realization of a learning health system is possible unlocking the potential of big data and its influence on clinical decision-making and hypothesis generation.","Todd McNutt,Todd McNutt,Michael R.

10.1002/nbm.4000,,,Probabilistic classification of tumour habitats in soft tissue sarcoma,"The purpose of this work is to propose a method to characterize tumour heterogeneity on MRI, using probabilistic classification based on a reference tissue. The method uses maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T2 relaxation, and a calculated map representing high-b-value diffusion-weighted MRI (denoted simDWI) to identify up to five habitats (i.e. sub-regions) of tumours. In this classification method, the parameter values (ADC, T2 , and simDWI) from each tumour voxel are compared against the corresponding parameter probability distributions in a reference tissue. The probability that a tumour voxel belongs to a specific habitat is the joint probability for all parameters. The classification can be visualized using a custom colour scheme. The proposed method was applied to data from seven patients with biopsy-confirmed soft tissue sarcoma, at three time-points over the course of pre-operative radiotherapy. Fast-spin-echo images with two different echo times and diffusion MRI with three b-values were obtained and used as inputs to the method. Imaging findings were compared with pathology reports from pre-radiotherapy biopsy and post-surgical resection. Regions of hypercellularity, high-T2 proteinaceous fluid, necrosis, collagenous stroma, and fibrosis were identified within soft tissue sarcoma. The classifications were qualitatively consistent with pathological observations. The percentage of necrosis on imaging correlated strongly with necrosis estimated from FDG-PET before radiotherapy (R2 =0.97) and after radiotherapy (R2 =0.96). The probabilistic classification method identifies realistic habitats and reflects the complex microenvironment of tumours, as demonstrated in soft tissue sarcoma.","Shu Guo Xing,Shu Xing,Carolyn R.

Radiomics were applied on PET/CT. Principal components (PC) for 42 CT and PET-derived features were examined to determine which ones accounted for most of variability. Survival analysis quantified ability of radiomics and SUVmax to predict outcome. PCs including homogeneity, size, maximum intensity, mean and median gray level, standard deviation, entropy, kurtosis, skewness, morphology and asymmetry were included in prediction models for regional control (RC) [PC4-HR:0.38, p=0.02], distant control (DC) [PC4-HR:0.51, p=0.02 and PC1-HR:1.12, p=0.01], recurrence free probability (RFP) [PC1-HR:1.08, p=0.04], disease specific survival (DSS) [PC2-HR:1.34, p=0.03 and PC3-HR:0.64, p=0.02] and overall survival (OS) [PC4-HR:0.45, p=0.004 and PC3-HR:0.74, p=0.02]. In combined analysis with SUVmax, PC1 lost predictive ability over SUVmax for RFP [HR:1.1, p=0.04] and DC [HR:1.13, p=0.002], while PC4 remained predictive of DC independent of SUVmax [HR:0.5, p=0.02]. Radiomics remained the only predictors of OS, DSS and RC. Neither SUVmax nor radiomics predicted recurrence free survival.

10.1093/jrr/rrx102,,,Radiomics and radiogenomics for precision radiotherapy.,"Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and staging of cancer, as well as in radiation treatment planning and evaluation of therapeutic response. Recently, there has been significant interest in extracting quantitative information from clinical standard-of-care images, i.e. radiomics, in order to provide a more comprehensive characterization of image phenotypes of the tumor. A number of studies have demonstrated that a deeper radiomic analysis can reveal novel image features that could provide useful diagnostic, prognostic or predictive information, improving upon currently used imaging metrics such as tumor size and volume. Furthermore, these imaging-derived phenotypes can be linked with genomic data, i.e. radiogenomics, in order to understand their biological underpinnings or further improve the prediction accuracy of clinical outcomes. In this article, we will provide an overview of radiomics and radiogenomics, including their rationale, technical and clinical aspects. We will also present some examples of the current results and some emerging paradigms in radiomics and radiogenomics for clinical oncology, with a focus on potential applications in radiotherapy. Finally, we will highlight the challenges in the field and suggest possible future directions in radiomics to maximize its potential impact on precision radiotherapy.","Jia Wu,Jia Wu,Jia Wu,Khin Khin Tha,Jia Wu,Xing Liu,Khin Khin Tha,Ruijiang Li,Lei Xing,Ruijiang Li",Journal of Radiation Research,2018.0

For each of the 30 patients enrolled, 440 radiomic features were extracted from both pre-CRT and mid-CRT PET images. The top 25 features with the highest areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for identifying local control status were selected as discriminative features. Four machine-learning methods, random forest (RF), support vector machine, logistic regression, and extreme learning machine, were used to build predictive models with clinical features, radiomic features or a combination of both. An RF model incorporating both clinical and radiomic features achieved the best predictive performance, with an accuracy of 93.3%, a specificity of 95.7%, and a sensitivity of 85.7%. Based on risk scores of local failure predicted by this model, the 2-year local control rate and PFS rate were 100.0% (95% CI 100.0–100.0%) and 52.2% (31.8–72.6%) in the low-risk group and 14.3% (0.0–40.2%) and 0.0% (0.0–40.2%) in the high-risk group, respectively. This model may have the potential to stratify patients with different risks of local failure after CRT for esophageal cancer, which may facilitate the delivery of personalized treatment.","Junfeng Xiong,Jun Zhao,Junfeng Xiong,Yu Wen,Jingchen Ma,Wen Yu,Yi Ren,Jingchen Ma,Yacheng Ren,Xiaolong Fu,Xiaolong Fu,Xiaolong Fu,Jun Zhao",Scientific Reports,2018.0

10.1007/s10549-020-05533-5,32020435.0,,MPRAD: A Multiparametric Radiomics Framework,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multiparametric radiological imaging is vital for detection, characterization, and diagnosis of many different diseases. Radiomics provide quantitative metrics from radiological imaging that may infer potential biological meaning of the underlying tissue. However, current methods are limited to regions of interest extracted from a single imaging parameter or modality, which limits the amount of information available within the data. This limitation can directly affect the integration and applicable scope of radiomics into different clinical settings, since single image radiomics are not capable of capturing the true underlying tissue characteristics in the multiparametric radiological imaging space. To that end, we developed a multiparametric imaging radiomic (mpRad) framework for extraction of first and second order radiomic features from multiparametric radiological datasets. METHODS: We developed five different radiomic techniques that extract different aspects of the inter-voxel and inter-parametric relationships within the high-dimensional multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging breast datasets. Our patient cohort consisted of 138 breast patients, where, 97 patients had malignant lesions and 41 patients had benign lesions. Sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and areas under the curve (AUC) analysis were performed to assess diagnostic performance of the mpRad parameters. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The mpRad features successfully classified malignant from benign breast lesions with excellent sensitivity and specificity of 82.5% and 80.5%, respectively, with Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.87 (0.81-0.93). mpRad provided a 9-28% increase in AUC metrics over single radiomic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: We have introduced the mpRad framework that extends radiomic analysis from single images to multiparametric datasets for better characterization of the underlying tissue biology.","Vishwa S.

PURPOSE: To develop and validate a triple-classification radiomics model for the preoperative differentiation of SC, SGCT, and SMT based on T2-weighted fat saturation (T2w FS) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE T1w) MRI. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: A total of 120 pathologically confirmed sacral patients (54 SCs, 30 SGCTs, and 36 SMTs) were retrospectively analyzed and divided into a training set (n=83) and a validation set (n=37). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: The 3.0T axial T2w FS and CE T1w MRI. ASSESSMENT: Morphology, intensity, and texture features were assessed based on Formfactor, Haralick, Gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), Gray-level run-length matrix (GLRLM), histogram. STATISTICAL TESTS: Analysis of variance, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Pearson correlation, Random Forest (RF), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy analysis. RESULTS: The median age of SGCT (33.5, 25.3-45.5) was significantly lower than those of SC (58.0, 48.8-64.3) and SMT (59.0, 46.3-65.5) groups (χ2 =37.6; P<0.05).

Seventy patients who received SBRT for stage-1 NSCLC were retrospectively identified. The tumor was contoured on pre-treatment free-breathing CT images, from which 43 quantitative radiomic features were extracted to collectively capture tumor morphology, intensity, fine-texture, and coarse-texture. Treatment failure was defined based on cancer recurrence, local cancer recurrence, and non-local cancer recurrence following SBRT. The univariate association between each radiomic feature and each clinical endpoint was analyzed using Welch's t-test, and p-values were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing. Multivariate associations were based on regularized logistic regression with a singular value decomposition to reduce the dimensionality of the radiomics data. Two features demonstrated a statistically significant association with local failure: Homogeneity2 (p = 0.022) and Long-Run-High-Gray-Level-Emphasis (p = 0.048). These results indicate that relatively dense tumors with a homogenous coarse texture might be linked to higher rates of local recurrence. Multivariable logistic regression models produced maximum values of , and , for the recurrence, local recurrence, and non-local recurrence endpoints, respectively. The CT-based radiomic features used in this study may be more associated with local failure than non-local failure following SBRT for stage I NSCLC.

Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to select features and generate a radiomics signature. Cox hazard survival analysis and Kaplan-Meier were performed in both cohorts. The radiomics nomogram was developed by integrating the optimized radiomics signature and clinical predictors, its calibration and discrimination were evaluated. The radiomics signatures were significantly associated with NSCLC patients’ survival time. The signature derived from the combined 2D and 3D features showed a better prognostic performance than those from 2D or 3D alone. Our radiomics nomogram integrated the optimal radiomics signature with clinical predictors showed a significant improvement in the prediction of patients’ survival compared with clinical predictors alone in the validation cohort. The calibration curve showed predicted survival time was very close to the actual one. The radiomics signature from the combined 2D and 3D features further improved the predicted accuracy of survival prognosis for the patients with NSCLC. Combination of the optimal radiomics signature and clinical predictors performed better for individualied survival prognosis estimation in patients with NSCLC. These findings might affect trearment strategies and enable a step forward for precise medicine.                   • We found both 2D and 3D radiomics signature have favorable prognosis, but 3D signature had a better performance.• The radiomics signature generated from the combined 2D and 3D features had a better predictive performance than those from 2D or 3D features. • Integrating the optimal radiomics signature with clinical predictors significantly improved the predictive power in patients’ survival compared with clinical TNM staging alone.","Lifeng Yang,Jingbo Yang,Lifeng Yang,Jingbo Yang,Xiaobo Zhou,Xiaobo Zhou,Luqi Huang,Weiling Zhao,Liyu Huang,Weiling Zhao,Tao Wang,Tao Wang,Tao Wang,Jian Zhuang,Jian Zhuang,Jie Tian,Jian Zhuang,Jie Tian",European Radiology,2019.0

Sixty-six patients from two centres (PA, n = 31; GBM, n = 35) were randomly divided into training and validation data sets (about 2:1). Quantitative radiomic features of the tumours were extracted from contrast-enhanced MR images. A subset of features was selected by feature stability and Boruta algorithm. The selected features were used to build a decision tree model. Predictive accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were used to assess model performance. The classification outcome of the model was combined with tumour location, age and gender features, and multivariable logistic regression analysis and permutation test using the entire data set were performed to further evaluate the decision tree model. A total of 271 radiomic features were successfully extracted for each tumour. Twelve features were selected as input variables to build the decision tree model. Two features S(1, -1) Entropy and S(2, -2) SumAverg were finally included in the model. The model showed an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 0.87, 0.90 and 0.83 for the training data set and 0.86, 0.80 and 0.91 for the validation data set. The classification outcome of the model related to the actual tumour types and did not rely on the other three features (p < 0.001). A decision tree model with two features derived from the contrast-enhanced MR images performed well in differentiating PA from GBM. • MRI findings of PA and GBM are sometimes very similar. • Radiomics provides much more quantitative information about tumours. • Radiomic features can help to distinguish PA from GBM.","Fei Dong,Qian Li,Fei Dong,Fei Dong,Duan Xu,Qian Li,Qian Li,Qian Li,Duo Xu,Wenji Xiu,Qiang Zeng,Wenji Xiu,Qiang Zeng,Xiu‐Liang Zhu,Fangfang Xu,Xiuliang Zhu,Fangfang Xu,Biao Jiang,Minming Zhang,Biao Jiang,Minming Zhang",European Radiology,2019.0
10.1007/s00330-018-5872-6,,,Differentiation of clear cell and non-clear cell renal cell carcinomas by all-relevant radiomics features from multiphase CT: a VHL mutation perspective,"To develop a radiomics model with all-relevant imaging features from multiphasic computed tomography (CT) for differentiating clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) from non-ccRCC and to investigate the possible radiogenomics link between the imaging features and a key ccRCC driver gene—the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene mutation. In this retrospective two-center study, two radiomics models were built using random forest from a training cohort (170 patients), where one model was built with all-relevant features and the other with minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) features. A model combining all-relevant features and clinical factors (sex, age) was also built. The radiogenomics association between selected features and VHL mutation was investigated by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. All models were tested on an independent validation cohort (85 patients) with ROC curves analysis. The model with eight all-relevant features from corticomedullary phase CT achieved an AUC of 0.949 and an accuracy of 92.9% in the validation cohort, which significantly outperformed the model with eight mRMR features (seven from nephrographic phase and one from corticomedullary phase) with an AUC of 0.851 and an accuracy of 81.2%. Combining age and sex did not benefit the performance. Five out of eight all-relevant features were significantly associated with VHL mutation, while all eight mRMR features were significantly associated with VHL mutation (false discovery rate-adjusted p<0.05). All-relevant features in corticomedullary phase CT can be used to differentiate ccRCC from non-ccRCC. Most subtype-discriminative imaging features were found to be significantly associated with VHL mutation, which may underlie the molecular basis of the radiomics features.                   • All-relevant features in corticomedullary phase CT can be used to differentiate ccRCC from non-ccRCC with high accuracy.• Most RCC-subtype-discriminative CT features were associated with the key RCC-driven gene—the VHL gene mutation.• Radiomics model can be more accurate and interpretable when the imaging features could reflect underlying molecular basis of RCC.","Zhicheng Li,Guangtao Zhai,Zhicheng Li,Guangtao Zhai,Jinheng Zhang,Jinheng Zhang,Zhongqiu Wang,Guiqin Liu,Zhongqiu Wang,Guiqin Liu,Guangyu Wu,Guangyu Wu,Dong Liang,Guang-yu Wu,Hairong Zheng,Dong Liang,Hairong Zheng",European Radiology,2019.0

Material and methods: A total of 122 patients with NSCLC tested for EGFR/KRAS alterations were included. Clinical and radiological features were recorded.  Univariate analysis were performed to look at the associations of the studied features with EGFR/KRAS alterations. Previously calculated composite model parameters for each gene alteration prediction were applied to this validation cohort. ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves were drawn using the previously validated composite models, and also for each significant individual characteristic of the previous training cohort model. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) was calculated and compared between the full models.  Results: At univariate analysis, EGFR+ confirmed an association with an internal air bronchogram, pleural retraction, emphysema and lack of smoking; KRAS+ with round shape, emphysema and smoking. The AUC (95%CI) in the new cohort was confirmed to be high for EGFR+ prediction, with a value of: 0.82 (0.69-0.95) vs. 0.82 in the previous cohort, whereas it was smaller for KRAS+ prediction, with a value of 0.60 (0.48-0.72) vs. 0.67 in the previous cohort. Looking at single features in the new cohort, we found that the AUC for the models including only smoking was similar to that of the full model (including radiological and clinical features) for both gene alterations.  Conclusions: Although this study validated the significant association of clinical and radiological features with EGFR/KRAS alterations, models based on these composite features are not superior to smoking history alone to predict the mutations.","Stefania Rizzo,Sara Raimondi,Stefania Rizzo,Sara Raimondi,Evelyn E.C. de Jong,Evelyn E.C. de Jong,Wouter van Elmpt,Francesca De Piano,Wouter van Elmpt,Francesca De Piano,Francesco Petrella,Francesco Petrella,Vincenzo Bagnardi,Arthur Jochems,Vincenzo Bagnardi,Arthur Jochems,Massimo Bellomi,Massimo Bellomi,Anne Marie C.

Radiomic features and clinical and hematological features of 118 LA-NSCLC cases were firstly extracted and analyzed in this study. Then, stable and prognostic radiomic features were automatically selected using the consensus clustering method with either Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model or random survival forest (RSF) analysis. Predictive radiomic, clinical, and hematological parameters were subsequently fitted into a final prognostic model using both the CPH model and the RSF model. A multimodality nomogram was then established from the fitting model and was cross-validated. Finally, calibration curves were generated with the predicted versus actual survival status. Radiomic features selected by clustering combined with CPH were found to be more predictive, with a C-index of 0.699 in comparison to 0.648 by clustering combined with RSF. Based on multivariate CPH model, our integrative nomogram achieved a C-index of 0.792 and retained 0.743 in the cross-validation analysis, outperforming radiomic, clinical, or hematological model alone. The calibration curve showed agreement between predicted and actual values for the 1-year and 2-year survival prediction.

A cohort of 404 glioblastoma patients (311 discoveries and 93 validations) was used in the study. Pretreatment volumetric postcontrast T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were segmented to obtain the relevant morphological measures. Kaplan-Meier, Cox proportional hazards, correlations, and Harrell’s concordance indexes (c-indexes) were used for the statistical analysis. A linear prognostic model based on the outstanding variables (age, contrast-enhanced (CE) rim width, and surface regularity) identified a group of patients with significantly better survival (p<0.001, HR=2.57) with high accuracy (discovery c-index=0.74; validation c-index=0.77). A similar model applied to totally resected patients was also able to predict survival (p<0.001, HR=3.43) with high predictive value (discovery c-index=0.81; validation c-index=0.92). Biopsied patients with better survival were well identified (p<0.001, HR=7.25) by a model including age and CE volume (c-index=0.87). Simple linear models based on small sets of meaningful MRI-based pretreatment morphological features and age predicted survival of glioblastoma patients to a high degree of accuracy. The partition of the population using the extent of resection improved the prognostic value of those measures.                   • A combination of two MRI-based morphological features (CE rim width and surface regularity) and patients’ age outperformed previous prognosis scores for glioblastoma. • Prognosis models for homogeneous surgical procedure groups led to even more accurate survival prediction based on Kaplan-Meier analysis and concordance indexes.","Julián Pérez-Beteta,David Molina,David Molina-García,Julián Pérez-Beteta,Alicia Martínez‐González,David Molina-García,Alicia Martínez-González,Araceli Henares-Molina,Araceli Henares-Molina,Mariano Amo-Salas,Mariano Amo-Salas,Belén Luque,Elena Arregui,Belén Luque,Manuel Calvo,Elena Arregui,José M.

Meanwhile, with the growing speed of data generation and the increasing volume of imaging data, it is highly demanded to apply computerised methods to process mpMRI data and extract useful information. Hence quantitative analysis for imaging data using radiomics has become an emerging paradigm. The application of radiomics approaches in prostate cancer has not only enabled automatic localisation of the disease but also provided a non-invasive solution to assess tumour biology (e.g. aggressiveness and the presence of hypoxia).

To date, several studies have reported significant variations in textural features due to differences in patient preparation, imaging protocols, lesion delineation, and feature extraction. Our objective was to study variations in features before a radiomics analysis of 18F-FDG PET data and to identify those feature extraction and imaging protocol parameters that minimize radiomic feature variations across PET imaging systems. Methods: A whole-body National Electrical Manufacturers Association image-quality phantom was imaged with 13 PET/CT systems at 12 different sites following local protocols. We selected 37 radiomic features related to the 4 largest spheres (17-37 mm) in the phantom. On the basis of a combined analysis of voxel size, bin size, and lesion volume changes, feature and imaging system ranks were established. A 1-way ANOVA was performed over voxel size, bin size, and lesion volume subgroups to identify the dependency and the trend change in feature variations across these parameters. Results: Feature ranking revealed that the gray-level cooccurrence matrix and shape features are the least sensitive to PET imaging system variations. Imaging system ranking illustrated that the use of point-spread function, small voxel sizes, and narrow gaussian postfiltering helped minimize feature variations. ANOVA subgroup analysis indicated that variations in each of the 37 features and for a given voxel size and bin size can be minimized. Conclusion: Our results provide guidance to selecting optimized features from 18F-FDG PET/CT studies. We were able to demonstrate that feature variations can be minimized for selected image parameters and imaging systems. These results can help imaging specialists and feature engineers in increasing the quality of future radiomics studies involving PET/CT.","László Papp,Laszlo Papp,Ivo Rausch,Ivo Rausch,Marko Grahovac,Marko Grahovac,Marcus Hacker,Marcus Hacker,Thomas Beyer,Thomas Beyer",The Journal of Nuclear Medicine,2019.0

Several morphologic features are conventionally used to evaluate the malignant characteristics in lung nodules at chest CT, including nodule size, margins, contours, and internal characteristics; however, the imaging features of malignant and benign lung nodules have considerable overlap (1). A number of imaging techniques have been applied to achieve better distinction between malignant and benign lung nodules to date, including dynamic contrast material–enhanced CT and MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI, and PET and SPECT imaging with radioactive tracers. However, no single robust method has been established to answer this simple but profound question: “Is this nodule benign or malignant?” The question has become more prevalent in the last few years, given the results of the National Lung Screening Trial and subsequent widespread implementation of low-dose CT screening for lung cancer (2). Recent results of another large, randomized, population-based trial in Europe, NELSON trial (the Dutch-Belgian Lung Cancer Screening Trial or Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings onderzoek) (3), also confirmed the value of low-dose CT screening in reducing lung cancer mortality in a high-risk population. These results are likely to accelerate CT lung cancer screening and screening-detected lung nodules requiring interpretation for malignant characteristics.In response to these needs, two major guidelines have been developed for reporting and managing lung nodules found on CT images: the Fleischner Society guidelines for incidentally detected nodules and the Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (or Lung-RADS) for screening-detected nodules (4). Based on the evaluations predominantly based on nodule size, both guidelines recommend follow-up re-evaluation with CT after a certain time interval for indeterminate nodules that cannot be characterized as malignant or benign with certainty. It is reasonable to follow up on indeterminate nodules with repeat CT, but there are also drawbacks, which include unnecessary radiation dose and costs associated with repeated CT scanning when nodules are benign and potential delays of cancer diagnosis when nodules are malignant. Ideally, a lung nodule should be distinguished as benign or malignant with high accuracy based on the imaging study that first depicted the nodule, most commonly on CT scan, without additional imaging studies and without delay.Radiomics has recently emerged as a promising approach in the field of medical imaging. Radiomics uses high-throughput extraction of a large amount of quantitative features from radiologic images and converts the images into mineable data that can be analyzed. This data then contributes to clinical decision support for improved diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive accuracy (5,6). In this issue of Radiology, Beig and colleagues (7) retrospectively evaluated perinodular and intranodular radiomic features of solitary pulmonary nodules pathologically proven to be either adenocarcinoma of the lung or granuloma, demonstrating the utility of the approach in distinguishing adenocarcinoma from granuloma. Notably, in addition to the radiomic features of the segmented nodule alone (intranodular radiomic features), the study included the radiomic features of “perinodular region,” defined as the immediate lung parenchyma outside of the nodule up to a 30-mm distance. The study showed that the addition of perinodular radiomic features to the intranodular features improved the predictive ability of the approach to distinguish adenocarcinomas from granulomas (7).This retrospective study included patients from two institutions who had solitary pulmonary nodules on chest CT scans that were pathologically proven to be either adenocarcinoma of the lung or granuloma through thoracoscopic wedge resection. The eligible patients were divided into two cohorts, a training set and a test set, each containing 145 patients with the ratio for adenocarcinoma to granuloma being nearly 1:1 (7). The chest CT images of these patients were evaluated by a radiologist. Nodules were manually segmented on two-dimensional axial CT images. The radiomic features were extracted from a single representative slice with the largest nodule area for the “intranodular” region. For perinodular region, the features of a ring of lung parenchyma immediately around the nodule up to 30-mm distance were extracted and divided into 5-mm rings from the nodule border. These radiomic features were analyzed for the ability to distinguish adenocarcinoma from granuloma by using perinodular features alone, intranodular features alone, and combined perinodular and intranodular features. For each of the three analyses, the training set was used to obtain the top 12 radiomic features for distinction of adenocarcinoma versus granuloma, which were then tested in a test cohort. Perinodular radiomic features achieved an area under the curve of 0.74 (95% confidence interval: 0.57, 0.90) and intranodular radiomic features achieved an area under the curve of 0.75 (95% confidence interval: 0.59, −0.91). Combining both perinodular and intranodular features improved the area under the curve to 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.65, 0.94). Among the top 12 features obtained in the combined analysis, three were from the perinodular region of 5 mm outside the tumor and the rest were from the intranodular region; however, none of the nodule shape features were selected. Training of the convolutional neural network model resulted in an area under the curve of 0.76 (95% confidence interval: 0.60, 0.92) in the test set (7).The study by Beig et al is innovative because it focuses on adding the perinodular radiomic features to the intranodular features in distinguishing adenocarcinomas from granulomas for solitary pulmonary nodules. This demonstrates the added value of using perinodular features from the immediate lung parenchyma surrounding the nodule to provide better diagnostic accuracy. Whereas most prior studies of radiomics for lung nodules focused on the nodule texture and shape features, the results from the present study indicate the importance of features surrounding the nodules in predicting their malignant nature. This direction aligns with the observations noted in the radiomics report of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in patients with breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. That report (8) notes that a combination of intratumoral features plus peritumoral features from the region immediately adjacent to the tumors was predictive of pathologic complete response. Peritumoral regions consisting of parenchyma immediately surrounding the tumors may be considered to represent tumor microenvironment. The role of tumor microenvironment has been increasingly recognized in defining biologic tumor behavior including aggressiveness, metastatic potential, and therapy response in the field of cancer biology and oncology. Beig et al expands the application of the tumor microenvironment concept to include the distinction of malignant versus benign lung nodules. The study added another promising, noninvasive, imaging-based strategy to achieve the ultimate goal of distinguishing malignant versus benign nodules with high accuracy and without delay.To this end, Beig and colleagues also present the histologic features of representative examples of adenocarcinoma and granuloma along with the radiomic features in an attempt to further understand the biologic background of the findings. At histologic analysis, a “rim” of densely packed tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor-associated macrophages were noted around adenocarcinomas, which were thought by the authors to manifest as smooth texture on CT images and potentially explain some of the radiomic features of adenocarcinomas. At the interface of granuloma and normal lung, scattered appearance of giant cells consisting of histiocytes and macrophages were noted, possibly explaining some of the radiomic features of granulomas (7). The observations from a limited number of representative examples are, of course, far from providing any robust conclusion of the authors’ hypothesis about the biologic background of radiomic features of lung nodules. However, their efforts of linking the complex and often nonintuitive machine-extracted features to the microscopic observations from nodule histologic analysis should be acknowledged. Their efforts also have relevance beyond the diagnosis of lung nodules, as the understanding of the biologic phenomenon in the tumor microenvironment focusing on packed tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor-associated macrophages is becoming more important in the setting of cancer therapy using immune-checkpoint blockade, for which predictive biomarkers for response to immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy are sorely needed (9). Radiomic signatures of tumor and peritumoral regions have recently been studied as an indicator of the density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes around the tumors, which may serve as a potential imaging marker for immunotherapy (10), further indicating the importance of the insight provided in the study by Beig and colleagues.The limitations of the study are well addressed by the authors and include a retrospective design with a moderate number of patients from two institutions. A larger cohort with prospective study design is needed to further validate the results. The cohort included only adenocarcinoma and granuloma as the most representative diagnoses of malignant and benign nodule groups. Although this is a well-chosen paradigm suitable for initial testing of their perinodular radiomic approach, future studies that include different histologic types of benign and malignant nodules are needed. The study technique was based on two-dimensional texture feature from a single representative slice with the largest nodule area, and it is of great interest if three-dimensional texture feature extraction from volumetric segmentation improves the diagnostic performance while maintaining practical matters, such as time needed for segmentation and feature extraction. Both the diagnostic and screening CT scans were included, and different types of CT scanners manufactured by different vendors were used. The section thickness and reconstruction methods also varied. The number of cases under each category is small, which limits the robustness of the results. Yet, the study performed subgroup analyses of the heterogeneous cohort often encountered in clinical practice. Diagnostic scans with section thickness less than or equal to 3 mm were associated with higher area under the curve, which may contribute to the development of minimum requirements for technical details of CT scanning for this type of approach. The number of screening scans was limited in the cohort, and further investigations are necessary to evaluate the performance of the approach for diagnosis of screening-detected nodules to meet the growing needs of the radiology community.In conclusion, perinodular radiomic features improved the distinction between adenocarcinoma and granuloma for solitary pulmonary nodules when combined with intranodular radiomic features. The results emphasize the importance of the nodule microenvironment differentiating malignant and benign nodules. Although future studies are needed to further improve the performance and to validate the approach, the study adds an important insight in advancing the diagnostic interpretation of lung nodules. The observations of the study are also coherent and applicable in the larger fields of medicine, including cancer therapy and biomarker development. Finally, given the promising results, technology transfer and clinical translation are essential for this approach to help diagnostic interpretation of lung nodules in the daily practice setting of radiology.Disclosures of Conflicts of Interest: M.N.

10.1007/s13139-019-00578-x,31231435.0,,Perspectives in Radiomics for Personalized Medicine and Theranostics.,"Radiomics handles imaging biomarker from high-throughput feature extraction through complex pattern recognition that is difficult for human to process. Recent medical paradigms are rapidly changing to personalized medicine, including molecular targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and theranostics, and the importance of biomarkers for these is growing day by day. Even though biopsy continues to gold standard for tumor assessment in personalized medicine, imaging is expected to complement biopsy because it allows whole tumor evaluation, whole body evaluation, and non-invasive and repetitive evaluation. Radiomics is known as a useful method to get imaging biomarkers related to intratumor heterogeneity in molecular targeted therapy as well as one-size-fits-all therapy. It is also expected to be useful in new paradigms such as immunotherapy and somatostatin receptor (SSTR) or prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted theranostics. Radiomics research should move to multimodality (CT, MR, PET, etc.), multicenter, and prospective studies from current single modality, single institution, and retrospective studies. Image-quality harmonization, intertumor heterogeneity, and integrative analysis of information from different scales are thought to be important keywords in future radiomics research. It is clear that radiomics will play an important role in personalized medicine.","Seunggyun Ha,Seunggyun Ha",Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging,2019.0
10.1183/13993003.00986-2018,30635290.0,,Predicting EGFR mutation status in lung adenocarcinoma on computed tomography image using deep learning,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) genotyping is critical for treatment guidelines such as the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung adenocarcinoma. Conventional identification of EGFR genotype requires biopsy and sequence testing which is invasive and may suffer from the difficulty of accessing tissue samples. Here, we propose a deep learning model to predict EGFR mutation status in lung adenocarcinoma using non-invasive computed tomography (CT).  We retrospectively collected data from 844 lung adenocarcinoma patients with pre-operative CT images, EGFR mutation and clinical information from two hospitals. An end-to-end deep learning model was proposed to predict the EGFR mutation status by CT scanning.  By training in 14926 CT images, the deep learning model achieved encouraging predictive performance in both the primary cohort (n=603; AUC 0.85, 95% CI 0.83–0.88) and the independent validation cohort (n=241; AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.79–0.83), which showed significant improvement over previous studies using hand-crafted CT features or clinical characteristics (p  Since CT is routinely used in lung cancer diagnosis, the deep learning model provides a non-invasive and easy-to-use method for EGFR mutation status prediction.","Shuo Wang,Jingyun Shi,Shuo Wang,Shuo Wang,Shuo Wang,Zhaoxiang Ye,Jingyun Shi,Zhaoxiang Ye,Zhaoxiang Ye,Di Dong,Dongdong Yu,Di Dong,Dongdong Yu,Mu Zhou,Ying Liu,Mu Zhou,Ying Liu,Olivier Gevaert,Kun Wang,Olivier Gevaert,Yongbei Zhu,Kun Wang,Kun Wang,Kun Wang,Hongyu Zhou,Yongbei Zhu,Zhenyu Liu,Hongyu Zhou,Zhenyu Liu,Zhenyu Liu,Jie Tian,Jie Tian",European Respiratory Journal,2019.0
10.1002/jmri.26688,30773770.0,,Preoperative prediction of lymphovascular invasion in invasive breast cancer with dynamic contrast-enhanced-MRI-based radiomics.,"BACKGROUND: Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) status facilitates the selection of optimal therapeutic strategy for breast cancer patients, but in clinical practice LVI status is determined in pathological specimens after resection. PURPOSE: To explore the use of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics for preoperative prediction of LVI in invasive breast cancer. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. POPULATION: Ninety training cohort patients (22 LVI-positive and 68 LVI-negative) and 59 validation cohort patients (22 LVI-positive and 37 LVI-negative) were enrolled. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5T and 3.0T, T1 -weighted DCE-MRI. ASSESSMENT: Axillary lymph node (ALN) status for each patient was evaluated based on MR images (defined as MRI ALN status), and DCE semiquantitative parameters of lesions were calculated. Radiomic features were extracted from the first postcontrast DCE-MRI. A radiomics signature was constructed in the training cohort with 10-fold cross-validation. The independent risk factors for LVI were identified and prediction models for LVI were developed. Their prediction performances and clinical usefulness were evaluated in the validation cohort. STATISTICAL TESTS: Mann-Whitney U-test, chi-square test, kappa statistics, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, DeLong test, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Two radiomic features were selected to construct the radiomics signature. MRI ALN status (odds ratio, 10.452; P<0.001) and the radiomics signature (odds ratio, 2.895; P=0.031) were identified as independent risk factors for LVI. The value of the area under the curve (AUC) for a model combining both (0.763) was higher than that for MRI ALN status alone (0.665; P=0.029) and similar to that for the radiomics signature (0.752; P=0.857). DCA showed that the combined model added more net benefit than either feature alone. DATA CONCLUSION: The DCE-MRI-based radiomics signature in combination with MRI ALN status was effective in predicting the LVI status of patients with invasive breast cancer before surgery.

10.1111/bju.14603,30378238.0,,"Prostate cancer heterogeneity: texture analysis score based on multiple magnetic resonance imaging sequences for detection, stratification and selection of lesions at time of biopsy","OBJECTIVE: To undertake an early proof-of-concept study on a novel, semi-automated texture-based scoring system in order to enhance the association between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions and clinically significant prostate cancer (SPCa). PATIENTS AND METHODS: With ethics approval, 536 imaging volumes were generated from 20 consecutive patients who underwent multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) at time of biopsy. Volumes of interest (VOIs) included zonal anatomy segmentation and suspicious MRI lesions for cancer (Likert Scale score >2). Entropy (E), measuring heterogeneity, was computed from VOIs and plotted as a multiparametric score defined as the entropy score (ES) = E ADC + E Ktrans + E Ve + E T2WI. The reference test that was used to define the ground truth comprised systematic saturation biopsies coupled with MRI-targeted sampling. This generated 422 cores in all that were individually labelled and oriented in three-dimensions. Diagnostic accuracy for detection of SPCa, defined as Gleason score ≥3 + 4 or >3 mm of any grade of cancer on a single core, was assessed using receiver operating characteristics, correlation, and descriptive statistics. The proportion of cancerous lesions detected by ES and visual scoring (VS) were statistically compared using the paired McNemar test. RESULTS: Any cancer (Gleason score 6-8) was found in 12 of the 20 (60%) patients, with a median PSA level of 8.22 ng/mL. SPCa (mean [95% confidence interval, CI] ES = 17.96 [0.72] NATural information unit [NAT]) had a significantly higher ES than non-SPCa (mean [95% CI] ES = 15.33 [0.76] NAT). The ES correlated with Gleason score (rs = 0.568, P = 0.033) and maximum cancer core length (ρ = 0.781; P < 0.001). The area under the curve for the ES (0.89) and VS (0.91) were not significantly different (P = 0.75) for the detection of SPCa amongst MRI lesions. Best ES estimated numerical threshold of 16.61 NAT led to a sensitivity of 100% and negative predictive value of 100%. The proportion of MRI lesions that were found to be positive for SPCa using this ES threshold (54%) was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than using the VS (24% of score 3, 4, 5) in a paired analysis using the McNemar test. In all, 53% of MRI lesions would have avoided biopsy sampling without missing significant disease. CONCLUSION: Capturing heterogeneity of prostate cancer across multiple MRI sequences with the ES yielded high performances for the detection and stratification of SPCa. The ES outperformed the VS in predicting positivity of lesions, holding promise in the selection of targets for biopsy and calling for further understanding of this association.","Clément Orczyk,Arnauld Villers,Clement Orczyk,Henry Rusinek,Arnauld Villers,Henry Rusinek,V.

Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging data from 411 breast cancer patients was studied. Patients were assigned to either a training cohort (n=279) or a validation cohort (n=132). Eight hundred eight radiomic features were extracted from the first phase of T1-DCE images. A support vector machine was used to develop a radiomic signature, and logistic regression was used to develop a nomogram. The radiomic signature based on 12 LN status–related features was constructed to predict LN metastasis, its prediction ability was moderate, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.76 and 0.78 in training and validation cohorts, respectively. Based on a radiomic signature and clinical features, a nomogram was developed and showed excellent predictive ability for LN metastasis (AUC 0.84 and 0.87 in training and validation sets, respectively). Another radiomic signature was constructed to distinguish the number of metastatic LNs (less than 2 positive nodes/more than 2 positive nodes), which also showed moderate performance (AUC 0.79). We developed a nomogram and a radiomic signature that can be used to identify LN metastasis and distinguish the number of metastatic LNs (less than 2 positive nodes/more than 2 positive nodes). Both nomogram and radiomic signature can be used as tools to assist clinicians in assessing LN metastasis in breast cancer patients. • ALNM is an important factor affecting breast cancer patients’ treatment and prognosis. • Traditional imaging examinations have limited value for evaluating axillary LNs status. • We developed a radiomic nomogram based on MR imagings to predict LN metastasis.","Lu Han,Lu Han,Yongbei Zhu,Yongbei Zhu,Zhenyu Liu,Tao Yu,Zhenyu Liu,Zhenyu Liu,Chao He,Tao Yu,Tao Yu,Wenyan Jiang,Cuiju He,Cuiju He,Yangyang Kan,Wenyan Jiang,Di Dong,Yangyang Kan,Di Dong,Jie Tian,Jie Tian,Yahong Luo,Yahong Luo,Yahong Luo",European Radiology,2019.0

Metabolic radiomics in particular analyses the spatial distribution patterns of molecular metabolism on PET images. Measuring intratumoral heterogeneity via image is one of the main targets of radiomics research, and it aims to build a image-based model for better patient management. The workflow of radiomics using texture analysis follows these steps: 1) imaging (image acquisition and reconstruction); 2) preprocessing (segmentation & quantization); 3) quantification (texture matrix design & texture feature extraction); and 4) analysis (statistics and/or machine learning). The parameters or conditions at each of thesesteps are effect on the results. In statistical testing or modeling, problems such as multiple comparisons, dependence on other variables, and high dimensionality of smallsample size data should be considered.

We retrospectively enrolled 389 first-attack AP patients (271 in the primary cohort and 118 in the validation cohort) from three tertiary referral centers; 126 and 55 patients endured recurrent attacks in each cohort. Four hundred twelve radiomics features were extracted from arterial and venous phase CECT images, and clinical characteristics were gathered to develop a clinical model. An optimal radiomics signature was chosen using a multivariable logistic regression or support vector machine. The radiomics model was developed and validated by incorporating the optimal radiomics signature and clinical characteristics. The performance of the radiomics model was assessed based on its calibration and classification metrics. The optimal radiomics signature was developed based on a multivariable logistic regression with 10 radiomics features. The classification accuracy of the radiomics model well predicted the recurrence of AP for both the primary and validation cohorts (87.1% and 89.0%, respectively).

Yet, response evaluation in clinical trials still remains on RECIST criteria. Purpose: To investigate the added value of a Delta-radiomics approach for early response prediction in patients with STS undergoing NAC Study type: Retrospective Population: 65 adult patients with newly-diagnosed, locally-advanced, histologically proven high-grade STS of trunk and extremities. All were treated by anthracycline-based NAC followed by surgery and had available MRI at baseline and after 2 cycles.Field strength/Sequence: Pre- and post-contrast enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1-WI), turbo spin echo T2-WI at 1.5T. Assessment: A threshold of <10% viable cells on surgical specimen defined good response (Good-HR). Two senior radiologists performed a semantic analysis of the MRI. After 3D manual segmentation of tumors at baseline and early evaluation, and standardization of voxelsizes and intensities, absolute changes in 33 texture and shape features were calculated. Statistical tests: Classification models based on logistic regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors and random forests were elaborated using cross-validation (training and validation) on 50 patients (‘training cohort’) and was validated on 15 other patients (‘test cohort’).Results: 16 patients were good-HR. Neither RECIST status, nor semantic radiological variables were associated with response except an edema decrease (p=0.003) although 14 shape and texture features were (range of p-values: 0.002-0.037). On the training cohort, the highest diagnostic performances were obtained with random forests built on 3 features: Δ_Histogram_Entropy, Δ_Elongation, Δ_Surrounding_Edema, which provided: AUROC=0.86, accuracy=88.1%, sensitivity=94.1%, specificity=66.3%. On the test cohort, this model provided an accuracy of 74.6% but 3/5 good-HR were systematically ill-classified.

The aim of this article is to provide a brief overview of prostate pathological grading as well as the relevant aspects of multiparametric (MRI) mpMRI, before indicating the potential that magnetic resonance textural analysis (MRTA) offers within prostate cancer. A review of the evidence base on MRTA in prostate cancer will enable discussion of the utility of this field while also indicating recommendations to future research. Radiomic textural analysis allows the assessment of spatial inter-relationships between pixels within an image by use of mathematical methods. First-order textural analysis is better understood and may have more clinical validity than higher-order textural features. Textural features extracted from apparent diffusion coefficient maps have shown the most potential for clinical utility in MRTA of prostate cancers. Future studies should aim to integrate machine learning techniques to better represent the role of MRTA in prostate cancer clinical practice. Nomenclature should be used to reduce misidentification between first-order and second-order energy and entropy. Automated methods of segmentation should be encouraged in order to reduce problems associated with inclusion of normal tissue within regions of interest. The retrospective and small-scale nature of most published studies, make it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions. Future larger prospective studies are required to validate the textural features indicated to have potential in characterisation and/or diagnosis of prostate cancer before translation into routine clinical practice.","Nishil Patel,Ann Henry,N.

10.1002/mp.13395,,,Time stability of delta-radiomics features and the impact on patient analysis in longitudinal CT images.,"PURPOSE: This study first aims to show that the values of texture features extracted from phantoms are stable over clinical timescales. Second, that changes in patients' feature values over the course of radiation therapy (RT) are treatment induced and statistically significant. METHODS: The CT datasets of a 3D printed anatomically informed texture phantom containing liver and low-contrast modules, and the homogeneous module of the Catphan 500-Series phantom, were acquired once per week over the course of a 6-week period, to simulate the timescale of conventional RT duration. A Definition AS Open CT scanner on rails (Siemens) and our institution's standard abdominal protocol were used. In each phantom module, 8 regions of interest (20cm 3 ) were selected and 50 texture features were extracted from each module over the longitudinal dataset. The time stability of each feature was evaluated. The expected variation over the treatment timescale was quantified for each texture (module). Subsequently, the pancreas heads of 10 patients who underwent RT for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas head with a pathologic response of at least ""moderate"" (grade 2), were contoured on the daily CTs acquired using the same scanner. The pancreas heads were contoured on one image per week. Mean CT number, skewness, kurtosis, and coarseness were extracted from these data. The phantom modules were shown to be accurate representations of these features in the pancreas data. The change in the feature value between fractions 2 and 26 was compared with the phantom data in order to identify significant changes in feature value. RESULTS: Of the 50 features examined in all 3 phantom modules, 47 were found to have zero time-trend when a fit assuming homogeneous variance was used. When a fit allowing for heterogeneous variance was used, 49 features were found to have zero time-trend. Features were stable and repeatable within a feature-specific confidence interval over the 6-week period of acquisition in all three phantom modules. Changes in feature value between fractions 2 and 26 were highly patient specific. Mean CT number was found to decrease significantly in 7 of 10 patients and increase significantly in one patient. Skewness increased significantly in one patient and decreased significantly in one patient. Kurtosis decreased significantly in four patients and increased significantly in one patient. Coarseness increased significantly in seven patients and decreased significantly in one patient. Only one patient experienced no significant changes in feature value. CONCLUSION: The CT texture feature measurements of phantoms are stable and repeatable within a feature-specific confidence interval in all three phantom modules. This suggests that the changes observed in features extracted from longitudinal patient CT data may be treatment induced, and demonstrates their potentiality for early assessment of treatment response.","Tia Plautz,Cheng Zheng,Tia E.

10.1016/j.artmed.2018.09.003,30292538.0,,Towards a modular decision support system for radiomics: A case study on rectal cancer.,"Abstract   Following the personalized medicine paradigm, there is a growing interest in medical agents capable of predicting the effect of therapies on patients, by exploiting the amount of data that is now available for each patient. In disciplines like oncology, where images and scans are available, the exploitation of medical images can provide an additional source of potentially useful information. The study and analysis of features extracted by medical images, exploited for predictive purposes, is termed radiomics. A number of tools are available for supporting some of the steps of the radiomics process, but there is a lack of approaches which are able to deal with all the steps of the process.  In this paper, we introduce a medical agent-based decision support system capable of handling the whole radiomics process. The proposed system is tested on two independent data sets of patients treated for rectal cancer. Experimental results indicate that the system is able to generate highly performant centre-specific predictive model, and show the issues related to differences in data sets collected by different centres, and how such issues can affect the performance of the generated predictive models.","Roberto Gatta,Mauro Vallati,Roberto Gatta,Mauro Vallati,N.

For evaluating the related factors of postoperative recurrence probability of chordoma before surgery, we retrospective collected 80 patients to analyze by using a novel radiomics method. A total of 620 3D imaging features used for radiomics analysis were extracted, and 5 features were selected from T2-weighted (T2-w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that were most strongly associated with 4-year recurrence probability to build a radiomics signature. Verification by logistic regression classification model, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and accuracy was 0.8600 (95% CI: 0.7226-0.9824) and 85.00% in the training cohort, respectively, while in the validation cohort was 0.8568 (95% CI: 0.7327-0.9758) and 85.00%. Experimental results show that T2-w MRI-based radiomics signature is closely associated with the recurrence of chordoma.

Radiologists again at the forefront of innovation in medicine,"One of the most promising areas of health innovation is the application of artificial intelligence (AI), primarily in medical imaging. This article provides basic definitions of terms such as “machine/deep learning” and analyses the integration of AI into radiology. Publications on AI have drastically increased from about 100–150 per year in 2007–2008 to 700–800 per year in 2016–2017. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography collectively account for more than 50% of current articles. Neuroradiology appears in about one-third of the papers, followed by musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, breast, urogenital, lung/thorax, and abdomen, each representing 6–9% of articles. With an irreversible increase in the amount of data and the possibility to use AI to identify findings either detectable or not by the human eye, radiology is now moving from a subjective perceptual skill to a more objective science. Radiologists, who were on the forefront of the digital era in medicine, can guide the introduction of AI into healthcare. Yet, they will not be replaced because radiology includes communication of diagnosis, consideration of patient’s values and preferences, medical judgment, quality assurance, education, policy-making, and interventional procedures. The higher efficiency provided by AI will allow radiologists to perform more value-added tasks, becoming more visible to patients and playing a vital role in multidisciplinary clinical teams.","Filippo Pesapane,Filippo Pesapane,Marina Codari,Marina Codari,Francesco Sardanelli,Francesco Sardanelli",,2018.0

Two hundred ninety six consecutive patients, who underwent CT examinations before operation within 3months and had EGFR mutations tested, were enrolled in this retrospective study. CT texture features were extracted using an open-source software with whole volume segmentation. The association between CT texture features and EGFR mutation statuses were analyzed. In the 296 patients, there were 151 patients with EGFR mutations (51%). Logistic analysis identified that lower age (Odds Ratio[OR]: 0.968,95% confidence interval [CI]:0.946~0.990, p=0.005) and a radiomic feature named GreyLevelNonuniformityNormalized (OR: 0.012, 95% CI:0.000~0.352, p=0.01) were predictors for exon 19 mutation; higher age (OR: 1.027, 95%CI:1.003~1.052,p=0.025), female sex (OR: 2.189, 95%CI:1.264~3.791, p=0.005) and a radiomic feature named Maximum2DDiameterColumn (OR: 0.968, 95%CI:0.946~0.990], p=0.005) for exon 21 mutation; and female sex (OR: 1.883,95%CI:1.064~3.329, p=0.030), non-smoking status (OR: 2.070, 95%CI:1.090~3.929, p=0.026) and a radiomic feature termed SizeZone NonUniformityNormalized (OR: 0.010, 95% CI:0.0001~0.852, p=0.042) for EGFR mutations. Areas under the curve (AUCs) of combination with clinical and radiomic features to predict exon 19 mutation, exon 21 mutation and EGFR mutations were 0.655, 0.675 and 0.664, respectively. Several radiomic features are associated with EGFR mutation statuses of lung adenocarcinoma. Combination with clinical files, moderate diagnostic performance can be obtained to predict EGFR mutation status of lung adenocarcinoma. Radiomic features might harbor potential surrogate biomarkers for identification of EGRF mutation statuses.","Dongdong Mei,Dongdong Mei,Yan Luo,Yan Luo,Yan Luo,Yan Wang,Jingshan Gong,Yan Wang,Jingshan Gong",Cancer Imaging,2018.0
10.1371/journal.pone.0206607,,,"Data-driven, voxel-based analysis of brain PET images: Application of PCA and LASSO methods to visualize and quantify patterns of neurodegeneration","Spatial patterns of radiotracer binding in positron emission tomography (PET) images may convey information related to the disease topology. However, this information is not captured by the standard PET image analysis that quantifies the mean radiotracer uptake within a region of interest (ROI). On the other hand, spatial analyses that use more advanced radiomic features may be difficult to interpret. Here we propose an alternative data-driven, voxel-based approach to spatial pattern analysis in brain PET, which can be easily interpreted. We apply principal component analysis (PCA) to identify voxel covariance patterns, and optimally combine several patterns using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The resulting models predict clinical disease metrics from raw voxel values, allowing for inclusion of clinical covariates. The analysis is performed on high-resolution PET images from healthy controls and subjects affected by Parkinson's disease (PD), acquired with a pre-synaptic and a post-synaptic dopaminergic PET tracer. We demonstrate that PCA identifies robust and tracer-specific binding patterns in sub-cortical brain structures; the patterns evolve as a function of disease progression. Principal component LASSO (PC-LASSO) models of clinical disease metrics achieve higher predictive accuracy compared to the mean tracer binding ratio (BR) alone: the cross-validated test mean squared error of adjusted disease duration (motor impairment score) was 16.3 ± 0.17 years2 (9.7 ± 0.15) with mean BR, versus 14.4 ± 0.18 years2 (8.9 ± 0.16) with PC-LASSO. We interpret the best-performing PC-LASSO models in the spatial sense and discuss them with reference to the PD pathology and somatotopic organization of the striatum. PC-LASSO is thus shown to be a useful method to analyze clinically-relevant tracer binding patterns, and to construct interpretable, imaging-based predictive models of clinical metrics.","Ivan S.

10.21037/jtd.2018.11.03,,,Detection of epithelial growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutations on CT images of patients with lung adenocarcinoma using radiomics and/or multi-level residual convolutionary neural networks,"Background:  We aim to analyze the ability to detect epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations on chest CT images of patients with lung adenocarcinoma using radiomics and/or multi-level residual convolutionary neural networks (MCNNs). Methods:  We retrospectively collected 1,010 consecutive patients in Shanghai Chest Hospital from 2013 to 2017, among which 510 patients were EGFR-mutated and 500 patients were wild-type. The patients were randomly divided into a training set (810 patients) and a validation set (200 patients) according to a balanced distribution of clinical features. The CT images and the corresponding EGFR status measured by Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) method of the patients in the training set were utilized to construct both a radiomics-based model (M Radiomics ) and MCNNs-based model (M MCNNs ). The M Radiomics  and M MCNNs  were combined to build the Model Radiomics+MCNNs  (M Radiomics+MCNNs ). Clinical data of gender and smoking history constructed the clinical features-based model (MClinical). MClinical was then added into M Radiomics , M MCNNs , and M Radiomics+MCNNs  to establish the ModelRadiomics+Clinical (M Radiomics +Clinical), the Model MCNNs+Clinical  (M MCNNs +Clinical) and the Model Radiomics+MCNNs +Clinical (M Radiomics+MCNNs +Clinical). All the seven models were tested in the validation set to ascertain whether they were competent to detect EGFR mutations. The detection efficiency of each model was also compared in terms of area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. Results:  The AUC of the M Radiomics , M MCNNs  and M Radiomics+MCNNs  to predict  EGFR  mutations was 0.740, 0.810 and 0.811 respectively. The performance of M MCNNs  was better than that of M Radiomics  (P=0.0225). The addition of clinical features did not improve the AUC of the M Radiomics  (P=0.623), the M MCNNs  (P=0.114) and the M Radiomics+MCNNs  (P=0.058). The M Radiomics+MCNNs +Clinical demonstrated the highest AUC value of 0.834. The M MCNNs  did not demonstrate any inferiority when compared with the M Radiomics+MCNNs  (P=0.742) and the M Radiomics+MCNNs +Clinical (P=0.056). Conclusions:  Both of the M Radiomics  and the MCNNs could predict EGFR mutations on CT images of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. The M MCNNs  outperformed the M Radiomics  in the detection of EGFR mutations. The combination of these two models, even added with clinical features, is not significantly more efficient than M MCNNs  alone.","Xiaoyang Li,Junfeng Xiong,Xiaoyang Li,Junfeng Xiong,Tian-Ying Jia,Tian-Ying Jia,Tongyi Shen,Ronghui Hou,Tian-Le Shen,Run-Ping Hou,Jun Zhao,Xiaolong Fu,Jun Zhao,Jun Zhao,Xiaolong Fu,Xiaolong Fu",Journal of Thoracic Disease,2018.0

10.1088/1361-6560/aaefac,,,Effects of CT FOV displacement and acquisition parameters variation on texture analysis features.,"Texture analysis (TA) applied to CT imaging is an intensely studied topic and many studies suggested TA potential value in imaging characterisation for diagnostic purposes in different fields. However, often authors do not consider the reproducibility and the robustness versus variations in acquisition parameters; in this work, we wanted to explore the robustness of the TA features extracted from CT images. We scanned a commercial phantom (CIRS model 062M) containing plugs with nine different tissue equivalent electron densities using two different CT scanners of the same vendor and changing tube current (100 and 200 mA without modulation) and peak voltage (80 and 140 kVp). After the segmentation, we extracted TA features with LifeX and data were then statistically analysed using the generic estimate equations (GEE) method. Our results suggest that only seven out of 37 TA features extracted are not affected by variation in acquisition parameters considered in this study: GLRLM lgre, GLRLM srlge, GLRLM lrgle, GLZLM lze, GLZLM lgze, GLZLM szlge, GLZLM lzlge.

The purpose was to preoperatively predict IDH mutation status in GBM using multiregional radiomics features from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, 225 patients were included. A total of 1614 multiregional features were extracted from enhancement area, non-enhancement area, necrosis, edema, tumor core, and whole tumor in multiparametric MRI. Three multiregional radiomics models were built from tumor core, whole tumor, and all regions using an all-relevant feature selection and a random forest classification for predicting IDH1. Four single-region models and a model combining all-region features with clinical factors (age, sex, and Karnofsky performance status) were also built. All models were built from a training cohort (118 patients) and tested on an independent validation cohort (107 patients). RESULTS: Among the four single-region radiomics models, the edema model achieved the best accuracy of 96% and the best F1-score of 0.75 while the non-enhancement model achieved the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88 in the validation cohort. The overall performance of the tumor-core model (accuracy 0.96, AUC 0.86 and F1-score 0.75) and the whole-tumor model (accuracy 0.96, AUC 0.88 and F1-score 0.75) was slightly better than the single-regional models. The 8-feature all-region radiomics model achieved an improved overall performance of an accuracy 96%, an AUC 0.90, and an F1-score 0.78. Among all models, the model combining all-region imaging features with age achieved the best performance of an accuracy 97%, an AUC 0.96, and an F1-score 0.84. CONCLUSIONS: The radiomics model built with multiregional features from multiparametric MRI has the potential to preoperatively detect the IDH1 mutation status in GBM patients. The multiregional model built with all-region features performed better than the single-region models, while combining age with all-region features achieved the best performance.","Zhicheng Li,Zhicheng Li,Hao Bai,Hongmin Bai,Qinjun Sun,Yuanshen Zhao,Qiuchang Sun,Yuanshen Zhao,Yuanshen Zhao,Yuanshen Zhao,Yuanshen Zhao,Yanchun Lv,Jian Zhou,Yanchun Lv,Jian Zhou,Chaofeng Liang,Yinsheng Chen,Chaofeng Liang,Yinsheng Chen,Dong Liang,Hairong Zheng,Dong Liang,Hairong Zheng",Cancer Medicine,2018.0

Two in-house radiomics packages and two freely available radiomics packages, MaZda and IBEX, were utilized. Forty 256×256-pixel regions of interest (ROIs) from 40 digital mammograms were studied along with 39 manually delineated ROIs from the head and neck (HN) computed tomography (CT) scans of 39 patients. Each package was used to calculate first-order histogram and second-order gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features. Friedman tests determined differences in feature values across packages, whereas intraclass-correlation coefficients (ICC) quantified agreement. All first-order features computed from both mammography and HN cases (except skewness in mammography) showed significant differences across all packages due to systematic biases introduced by each package; however, based on ICC values, all but one first-order feature calculated on mammography ROIs and all but two first-order features calculated on HN CT ROIs showed excellent agreement, indicating the observed differences were small relative to the feature values but the bias was systematic. All second-order features computed from the two databases both differed significantly and showed poor agreement among packages, due largely to discrepancies in package-specific default GLCM parameters. Additional differences in radiomics features were traced to variations in image preprocessing, algorithm implementation, and naming conventions. Large variations in features among software packages indicate that increased efforts to standardize radiomics processes must be conducted.","Joseph J. Foy,Kayla Robinson,Kayla R. Mendel,Joseph J.

Recent advances in digital image analysis methods and machine learning have led to significant interest in extracting additional information from medical and digital whole-slide images in radiology and pathology, respectively. This has led to significant interest and research in radiomics and pathomics to correlate phenotypic features of disease with image analytics in order to identify image-based biomarkers. The expanding role of big data in radiology and pathology parallels the development and role of immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the daily practice of pathology. IHC methods were initially developed to provide additional information to help classify tumors and then transformed into an indispensable tool to guide treatment in many types of cancer. IHC markers are used in daily practice to identify specific types of cells and highlight their distributions in tissues in order to distinguish benign from neoplastic cells, determine tumor origin, subclassify neoplasms, and support and confirm diagnoses. In this regard, radiomics, pathomics, and IHC methods are very similar since they enable the extraction of image-based features to characterize various properties of diseases. Due to the dramatic advancements in recent radiomics research, we provide a brief overview of the role of established and emerging IHC biomarkers in various tumor types that have been correlated with radiologic biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy, predict prognosis, guide patient management, and select treatment strategies.

10.1002/jmri.26798,31132207.0,,Radiomics model of contrast-enhanced MRI for early prediction of acute pancreatitis severity.,"BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) or MR images may cause the severity of early acute pancreatitis (AP) to be underestimated. As an innovative image analysis method, radiomics may have potential clinical value in early prediction of AP severity. PURPOSE: To develop a contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI-based radiomics model for the early prediction of AP severity. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. SUBJECTS: A total of 259 early AP patients were divided into two cohorts, a training cohort (99 nonsevere, 81 severe), and a validation cohort (43 nonsevere, 36 severe). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0T, T1 -weighted CE-MRI. ASSESSMENT: Radiomics features were extracted from the portal venous-phase images. The ""Boruta"" algorithm was used for feature selection and a support vector machine model was established with optimal features. The MR severity index (MRSI), the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, and the bedside index for severity in acute pancreatitis (BISAP) were calculated to predict the severity of AP. STATISTICAL TESTS: Independent t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, chi-square test, Fisher's exact tests, Boruta algorithm, receiver operating characteristic analysis, DeLong test.

10.3389/fonc.2019.00255,31024855.0,,A Computed Tomography-Based Radiomic Prognostic Marker of Advanced High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer Recurrence: A Multicenter Study,"Objectives: We used radiomic analysis to establish a radiomic signature based on preoperative contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) and explore its effectiveness as a novel recurrence risk prognostic marker for advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Methods: This study had a retrospective multicenter (two hospitals in China) design and a radiomic analysis was performed using contrast enhanced CT in advanced HGSOC (FIGO stage III or IV) patients. We used a minimum 18-month follow-up period for all patients (median 38.8 months, range 18.8–81.8 months). All patients were divided into three cohorts according to the timing of their surgery and hospital stay: training cohort (TC) and internal validation cohort (IVC) were from one hospital, and independent external validation cohort (IEVC) was from another hospital. A total of 620 3-D radiomic features were extracted and a Lasso-Cox regression was used for feature dimension reduction and determination of radiomic signature. Finally, we combined the radiomic signature with seven common clinical variables to develop a novel nomogram using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Results: A final 142 advanced HGSOC patients were enrolled. Patients were successfully divided into two groups with statistically significant differences based on radiomic signature, consisting of four radiomic features (log-rank test P = 0.001, <0.001, <0.001 for TC, IVC, and IEVC, respectively). The discrimination accuracies of radiomic signature for predicting recurrence risk within 18 months were 82.4% (95% CI, 77.8–87.0%), 77.3% (95% CI, 74.4–80.2%), and 79.7% (95% CI, 73.8–85.6%) for TC, IVC, and IEVC, respectively. Further, the discrimination accuracies of radiomic signature for predicting recurrence risk within 3 years were 83.4% (95% CI, 77.3–89.6%), 82.0% (95% CI, 78.9–85.1%), and 70.0% (95% CI, 63.6–76.4%) for TC, IVC, and IEVC, respectively. Finally, the accuracy of radiomic nomogram for predicting 18-month and 3-year recurrence risks were 84.1% (95% CI, 80.5–87.7%) and 88.9% (95% CI, 85.8–92.5%), respectively. Conclusions: Radiomic signature and radiomic nomogram may be low-cost, non-invasive means for successfully predicting risk for postoperative advanced HGSOC recurrence before or during the perioperative period. Radiomic signature is a potential prognostic marker that may allow for individualized evaluation of patients with advanced HGSOC.","Wei Wei,Wei Wei,Zhenyu Liu,Zhenyu Liu,Rong Yu,Zhenyu Liu,Yu Rong,Bin Zhou,Yan Bai,Bin Zhou,Shuo Wang,Yan Bai,Shuo Wang,Shuo Wang,Shuo Wang,Meiyun Wang,Meiyun Wang,Yingkun Guo,Jie Tian,Yingkun Guo,Jie Tian",Frontiers in Oncology,2019.0

It aims to provide several clues on how to use CNN for related tasks. MBCD is a long-standing problem, and massive computer-aided diagnosis models have been proposed. The models of CNN-based MBCD can be broadly categorized into three groups. One is to design shallow or to modify existing models to decrease the time cost as well as the number of instances for training; another is to make the best use of a pretrained CNN by transfer learning and fine-tuning; the third is to take advantage of CNN models for feature extraction, and the differentiation of malignant lesions from benign ones is fulfilled by using machine learning classifiers. This study enrolls peer-reviewed journal publications and presents technical details and pros and cons of each model. Furthermore, the findings, challenges and limitations are summarized and some clues on the future work are also given. Conclusively, CNN-based MBCD is at its early stage, and there is still a long way ahead in achieving the ultimate goal of using deep learning tools to facilitate clinical practice.

One hundred five astrocytomas (Grades II–IV) with contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI), T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2FLAIR), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map were enrolled in this study (training cohort: n=74; validation cohort: n=31). IDH1/2 genotypes were determined using Sanger sequencing. A total of 3882 radiomics features were extracted. Support vector machine algorithm was used to build the radiomics signature on the training cohort. Incorporating radiomics signature and clinico-radiological risk factors, the radiomics nomogram was developed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess these models. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and log rank test were performed to assess the prognostic value of the radiomics nomogram. The radiomics signature was built by six selected radiomics features and yielded AUC values of 0.901 and 0.888 in the training and validation cohorts. The radiomics nomogram based on the radiomics signature and age performed better than the clinico-radiological model (training cohort, AUC=0.913 and 0.817; validation cohort, AUC=0.900 and 0.804). Additionally, the survival analysis showed that prognostic values of the radiomics nomogram and IDH genotype were similar (log rank test, p<0.001; C-index=0.762 and 0.687; z-score test, p=0.062). The radiomics nomogram might be a useful supporting tool for the preoperative prediction of IDH genotype for astrocytoma, which could aid pretreatment decision-making.                   • The radiomics signature based on multiparametric and multiregional MRI images could predict IDH genotype of Grades II–IV astrocytomas. • The radiomics nomogram performed better than the clinico-radiological model, and it might be an easy-to-use supporting tool for IDH genotype prediction. • The prognostic value of the radiomics nomogram was similar with that of the IDH genotype, which might contribute to prognosis evaluating.","Yan Tan,Shuaitong Zhang,Yan Tan,Jing-Wei Wei,Shuaitong Zhang,Di Dong,Jingwei Wei,Xiaochun Wang,Di Dong,Xiao-chun Wang,Guoqiang Yang,Jie Tian,Guo-qiang Yang,Jie Tian,Hui Zhang,Jie Tian,Hui Zhang",European Radiology,2019.0

Radiomics converts medical images such as CT scans into high-throughput quantitative data that can be used to improve diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive accuracy. Indeed, radiomics can provide objective and comprehensive information regarding whole or subregions of cancers in a noninvasive and repeatable way (1). Radiomic signatures have been demonstrated to reflect intratumoral heterogeneity and to be associated with gene-expression profiles, both of which can serve as important prognostic factors (2). A myriad of research articles have showcased the potential of radiomics in providing useful imaging biomarkers in patients with cancer (1–3). However, radiomics has not yet been used in clinical practice due to several major obstacles, including: (a) lack of an easy-to-handle, high-performing set of analytic tools, and (b) variability of radiomic features that are prone to substantial influence from image acquisition parameters, as well as target selection, target segmentation, feature extraction/selection, and radiomics modeling.For CT radiomics, image reconstruction algorithms (ie, reconstruction kernels) and section thickness have been major sources of radiomic feature variability (4,5). Indeed, variability stemming from the use of different reconstruction kernels impedes the comparability of radiomic features between studies performed by different groups as well as in longitudinal studies that include a variety of imaging parameters. Theoretically, we may solve this issue by obtaining raw CT data (sinograms of CT acquisition) or by reconstructing and storing many combinations of CT reconstruction parameters. However, such solutions are not feasible in practice. Thus, another method to resolve this variability is warranted.In this issue of Radiology, Choe and colleagues (6) investigated the effect of different reconstruction kernels on CT radiomic features of lung nodules and attempted to improve the reproducibility of radiomic features by applying a convolutional neural network (CNN)–based kernel-conversion technique. To develop their conversion algorithm, they used residual learning in an end-to-end way. CT images reconstructed using a soft reconstruction kernel (termed B30f on their CT system) were converted by CNN to those of a sharp reconstruction kernel (B50f on their CT) and vice versa. The authors segmented 104 pulmonary nodules or masses and extracted 702 radiomic features from each lesion. Reproducibility of radiomic features was evaluated using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), which measures the agreement between two variables to evaluate reproducibility; CCC values of ± 1 denote perfect concordance and discordance, and a value of 0 denotes absence of concordance.Choe and colleagues found that the CCC between human readers for CT images with the same kernel setting was 0.92; the majority of radiomic features (84.3% of all 702 radiomic features) were reproducible (CCC ≥ 0.85). However, when it came to different reconstruction kernels, the story was different. The CCC between readers for images reconstructed with different CT kernels was markedly lower, at 0.38; only 15% (107 of 702 features) of the radiomic features were reproducible. Notably, texture and wavelet features were particularly influenced by the reconstruction kernels, both in non–contrast material–enhanced and contrast-enhanced CT scans. These results are in agreement with those of previous studies (4,5) and frankly were not surprising in the least.However, Choe et al reported impressive results when their CNN-based kernel-conversion algorithm was applied. The reproducibility of radiomic features using different reconstruction kernels showed dramatic improvement with their algorithm. In the pooled analysis of interreader variability using different kernels (B30f and B50f), CCCs improved from 0.38 to 0.84 after applying kernel conversion (CCC after images were converted from B50f to B30f, 0.84; CCC after images were converted from B30f to B50f, 0.83). The improvement in reproducibility was particularly noticeable in texture features and wavelet features, for which the reproducibility between the two kernels without kernel conversion was very low (CCCs of 0.61 and 0.35 for texture and wavelet features, respectively). Although we previously believed that different reconstruction kernels could not be used interchangeably in radiomics research, Choe and colleagues showed that it may be possible to compare radiomics features from CT images with different reconstruction kernels using this novel CNN-based kernel-conversion algorithm.Several issues remain to be solved prior to its application in real clinical practice. First, the actual effect of kernel conversion on the performance of radiomics was not analyzed. Thus, further studies must address whether the diagnostic, predictive, or prognostic values obtained using converted CT images would improve, preserve, or deteriorate its performance. Second, the study by Choe et al dealt with a very narrow and specific subject: kernel conversion between two reconstruction kernels (B30f and B50f) from a single CT scanner. It is possible, however, that variation between these soft and sharp kernels reflects the known variability between different CT manufacturers. Choe et al provided a clear example of the application of this brand-new and emerging technology (ie, CNN-based image style transfer). The impact of the authors' study is a major step forward in radiomics. Considering the rapid pace of deep learning technologies today, I am certain that a variety of deep learning–based solutions will eventually solve nearly every step of the radiomics process, including CT acquisition, target identification, segmentation, and feature extraction in the exciting years to come.In conclusion, a convolutional neural network–based kernel-conversion algorithm dramatically improved the similarity of CT radiomic features obtained using different reconstruction kernels. Deep learning–based approaches are expected to substantially contribute to the applicability of radiomics. The study by Choe et al will serve as one of the first steps toward bigger strides in radiomics.Disclosures of Conflicts of Interest: C.M.P. disclosed no relevant relationships.References1.

10.1007/s00330-019-06084-0,30887209.0,,Can peritumoral radiomics increase the efficiency of the prediction for lymph node metastasis in clinical stage T1 lung adenocarcinoma on CT,"To evaluate the efficiency of radiomics model on CT images of intratumoral and peritumoral lung parenchyma for preoperative prediction of lymph node (LN) metastasis in clinical stage T1 peripheral lung adenocarcinoma patients. Three hundred sixty-six peripheral lung adenocarcinoma patients with clinical stage T1 were evaluated using five CT scanners. For each patient, two volumes of interest (VOIs) on CT were defined as the gross tumor volume (GTV) and the peritumoral volume (PTV, 1.5cm around the tumor). One thousand nine hundred forty-six radiomic features were obtained from each VOI, and then refined for reproducibility and redundancy. The refined features were investigated for usefulness in building radiomic signatures by mRMR feature ranking method and LASSO classifier. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to develop a radiomic nomogram incorporating the radiomic signature and clinical parameters. The prediction performance was evaluated on the validation cohort. The radiomic signatures using the features of GTV and PTV showed a good ability in predicting LN metastasis with an AUC of 0.829 (95% CI, 0.745–0.913) and 0.825 (95% CI, 0.733–0.918), respectively. By incorporating the features of GTV and PTV, the AUC of radiomic signature increased to 0.843 (95% CI, 0.770–0.916). The AUC of radiomic nomogram was 0.869 (95% CI, 0.800–0.938). Radiomic signatures of GTV and PTV both had a good prediction ability in the prediction of LN metastasis, and there is no significant difference of AUC between the two groups. The proposed nomogram can be conveniently used to facilitate the preoperative prediction of LN metastasis in T1 peripheral lung adenocarcinomas.                   • Radiomics from peritumoral lung parenchyma increase the efficiency of the prediction for lymph node metastasis in clinical stage T1 lung adenocarcinoma on CT. • A radiomic nomogram was developed and validated to predict LN metastasis. • Different scan parameters on CT showed that radiomics signature had good predictive performance.","Xiang Wang,Xiang Wang,Xingyu Zhao,Qiong Li,Xingyu Zhao,Qiong Li,Wei Xia,Wei Xia,Wei Xia,Zhongmin Peng,Rui Zhang,Zhaohui Peng,Rui Zhang,Qingchu Li,Rui Zhang,Qingchu Li,Junming Jian,Wei Wang,Junming Jian,Wei Wang,Wei Wang,Yuguo Tang,Yuguo Tang,Yuguo Tang,Yuguo Tang,Shiyuan Liu,Shiyuan Liu,Shiyuan Liu,Shiyuan Liu,Xin Gao,Xin Gao,Xin Gao",European Radiology,2019.0

10.1109/trpms.2019.2912433,,,Combining Structural and Textural Assessments of Volumetric FDG-PET Uptake in NSCLC,"Numerous studies have reported the prognostic utility of texture analyses and the effectiveness of radiomics in PET and PET/CT assessment of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here we explore the potential, relative to this methodology, of an alternative model-based approach to tumour characterization, which was successfully applied to sarcoma in previous works. The spatial distribution of 3-D FDG-PET uptake is evaluated in the spatial referential determined by the best-fitting ellipsoidal pattern, which provides a univariate uptake profile function of the radial position of intratumoral voxels. A group of structural features is extracted from this fit that include two heterogeneity variables and statistical summaries of local metabolic gradients. We demonstrate that these variables capture aspects of tumour metabolism that are separate to those described by conventional texture features. Prognostic model selection is performed in terms of a number of classifiers, including stepwise selection of logistic models, LASSO, random forests and neural networks with respect to two-year survival status. Our results for a cohort of 93 NSCLC patients show that structural variables have significant prognostic potential, and that they may be used in conjunction with texture features in a traditional radiomics sense, toward improved baseline multivariate models of patient overall survival. The statistical significance of these models also demonstrates the relevance of these machine learning classifiers for prognostic variable selection.","Eric Wolsztynski,Eric Wolsztynski,Janet O’Sullivan,Janet O'Sullivan,Niall Hughes,Nicola M.

A combination of the radiomics signature with a clinical factors model was also constructed using the RF method. The performance of the model was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic curve.  Results  In this study, 64.2% (300/467) of the patients showed EGFR mutations. L858R mutation of exon 21 was the most common mutation type (185/301). We identified a CT-based radiomics signature that successfully discriminated between EGFR positive and EGFR negative in the training cohort (AUC = 0.831) and the validation cohort (AUC = 0.789). The radiomics signature combined with the clinical factors model was not superior to the simple radiomics signature in the two cohorts (p > .05).  Conclusion  As a noninvasive method, the CT-based radiomics signature can be used to predict the EGFR mutation status of LADC appearing as a subsolid nodule.  Implications for practice  Lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation is considered a subgroup of lung cancer that is sensitive to EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, some patients with inoperable subsolid LADC are unable to undergo tissue sampling by biopsy for molecular analysis in clinical practice. A computed tomography-based radiomics signature may serve as a noninvasive biomarker to predict the EGFR mutation status of subsolid LADCs when mutational profiling is not available or possible.","Xia Yang,Xinguan Yang,Xiao Dong,Xiao Dong,Jiao Wang,Weiwei Li,Jiao Wang,Zhuoran Gu,Weiwei Li,David Yang Gao,Zhuoran Gu,Nanshan Zhong,Dashan Gao,Nanshan Zhong,Nanshan Zhong,Yubao Guan,Yubao Guan",Oncologist,2019.0
10.1016/j.ebiom.2019.06.034,,,Development and validation of radiomic signatures of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma molecular features and subtypes,"Abstract   Background  Radiomics-based non-invasive biomarkers are promising to facilitate the translation of therapeutically related molecular subtypes for treatment allocation of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).    Methods  We included 113 HNSCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-HNSCC) project. Molecular phenotypes analyzed were RNA-defined HPV status, five DNA methylation subtypes, four gene expression subtypes and five somatic gene mutations. A total of 540 quantitative image features were extracted from pre-treatment CT scans. Features were selected and used in a regularized logistic regression model to build binary classifiers for each molecular subtype. Models were evaluated using the average area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve (AUC) of a stratified 10-fold cross-validation procedure repeated 10 times. Next, an HPV model was trained with the TCGA-HNSCC, and tested on a Stanford cohort (N=53).    Findings  Our results show that quantitative image features are capable of distinguishing several molecular phenotypes. We obtained significant predictive performance for RNA-defined HPV+ (AUC=0.73), DNA methylation subtypes MethylMix HPV+ (AUC=0.79), non-CIMP-atypical (AUC=0.77) and Stem-like-Smoking (AUC=0.71), and mutation of NSD1 (AUC=0.73). We externally validated the HPV prediction model (AUC=0.76) on the Stanford cohort. When compared to clinical models, radiomic models were superior to subtypes such as NOTCH1 mutation and DNA methylation subtype non-CIMP-atypical while were inferior for DNA methylation subtype CIMP-atypical and NSD1 mutation.    Interpretation  Our study demonstrates that radiomics can potentially serve as a non-invasive tool to identify treatment-relevant subtypes of HNSCC, opening up the possibility for patient stratification, treatment allocation and inclusion in clinical trials.

Methods  In a retrospective review of clinical spinal MRI database with a dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) sequence, a total of 61 patients without prior cancer diagnosis and later confirmed to have metastases (30 lung; 31 non-lung cancers) were identified. For hot-spot analysis, a manual ROI was placed to calculate three heuristic parameters from the wash-in, maximum, and wash-out phases in the DCE kinetics. For each case, the 3D tumor mask was generated by using the normalized-cut algorithm. Radiomics analysis was performed to extract histogram and texture features from three DCE parametric maps. Deep learning was performed using these maps as inputs into a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), as well as using all 12 sets of DCE images into a convolutional long short term memory (CLSTM) network.    Results  For hot-spot ROI analysis, mean wash-out slope was 0.25±10% for lung metastases and −9.8±12.9% for other tumors. CHAID classification using a wash-out slope of −6.6% followed by wash-in enhancement ratio of 98% achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.79. Radiomics analysis using features representing tumor heterogeneity only reached the highest accuracy of 0.71. Classification using CNN achieved a mean accuracy of 0.71±0.043, whereas a CLSTM improved accuracy to 0.81±0.034.    Conclusions  DCE-MRI machine-learning analysis methods have potential to predict lung cancer metastases in the spine, which may be used to guide subsequent workup for confirmed diagnosis.","Ning Lv,Ning Lang,Yang Zhang,Yang Zhang,Enlong Zhang,Enlong Zhang,Jiahui Zhang,Jiahui Zhang,Daniel Chow,Peter D.

10.18383/j.tom.2018.00034,30854457.0,,Explaining Deep Features Using Radiologist-Defined Semantic Features and Traditional Quantitative Features,"Quantitative features are generated from a tumor phenotype by various data characterization, feature-extraction approaches and have been used successfully as a biomarker. These features give us information about a nodule, for example, nodule size, pixel intensity, histogram-based information, and texture information from wavelets or a convolution kernel. Semantic features, on the other hand, can be generated by an experienced radiologist and consist of the common characteristics of a tumor, for example, location of a tumor, fissure, or pleural wall attachment, presence of fibrosis or emphysema, concave cut on nodule surface. These features have been derived for lung nodules by our group. Semantic features have also shown promise in predicting malignancy. Deep features from images are generally extracted from the last layers before the classification layer of a convolutional neural network (CNN). By training with the use of different types of images, the CNN learns to recognize various patterns and textures. But when we extract deep features, there is no specific naming approach for them, other than denoting them by the feature column number (position of a neuron in a hidden layer). In this study, we tried to relate and explain deep features with respect to traditional quantitative features and semantic features. We discovered that 26 deep features from the Vgg-S neural network and 12 deep features from our trained CNN could be explained by semantic or traditional quantitative features. From this, we concluded that those deep features can have a recognizable definition via semantic or quantitative features.","Rahul Paul,Matthew B. Schabath,Rahul Paul,Matthew B.

This study assessed non-contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted images of 150 hepatic tumors. The lesions included 50 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), 50 metastatic tumors (MTs), and 50 hepatic hemangiomas (HHs) found respectively in 37, 23, and 33 patients. For classification, texture features were calculated, and also persistence images of three types (degree 0, degree 1 and degree 2) were obtained for each lesion from the 3D MR imaging data. We used three classification models. In the classification of HCC and MT (resp. HCC and HH, HH and MT), we obtained accuracy of 92% (resp. 90%, 73%) by texture analysis, and the highest accuracy of 85% (resp. 84%, 74%) when degree 1 (resp. degree 1, degree 2) persistence images were used. Our methods using texture analysis or topological data analysis allow for classification of the three hepatic tumors with considerable accuracy, and thus might be useful when applied for computer-aided diagnosis with MR images.","Asuka Oyama,Yasuaki Hiraoka,Asuka Oyama,Yasuaki Hiraoka,Ippei Obayashi,Ippei Obayashi,Yusuke Saikawa,Shigeru Furui,Yusuke Saikawa,Kenshiro Shiraishi,Shigeru Furui,Kenshiro Shiraishi,Shinobu Kumagai,Tatsuya Hayashi,Shinobu Kumagai,Tatsuya Hayashi,J.

However, the presence of stroke lesions is usually overlooked by automatic neuroimage processing methods and the-state-of-the-art deep learning schemes, which lack sufficient annotated data. We explore the use of radiomics in identifying whether a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan belongs to an individual that had a stroke or not.    Materials and methods  We used 1800 3D sets of MRI data from three prospective studies: one of stroke mechanisms and two of cognitive ageing, evaluated 114 textural features in WMH, cerebrospinal fluid, deep grey and normal-appearing white matter, and attempted to classify the scans using a random forest and support vector machine classifiers with and without feature selection. We evaluated the discriminatory power of each feature independently in each population and corrected the result against Type 1 errors. We also evaluated the influence of clinical parameters in the classification results.    Results  Subtypes of ischaemic strokes (i.e. lacunar vs. cortical) cannot be discerned using radiomics, but the presence of a stroke-type lesion can be ascertained with accuracies ranging from 0.7    Conclusions  Texture features in conventionally automatically segmented tissues may help in the identification of the presence of previous stroke lesions on an MRI scan, and should be taken into account in transfer learning strategies of the-state-of-the-art deep learning schemes.","Rafael Ortiz-Ramón,Rafael Ortiz-Ramon,Maria del C.

A total of 286 patients with pathologically proven adnexal tumor were retrospectively included in this study. We evaluated diagnostic performance of the signatures derived from MRI radiomics in differentiating (1) between benign adnexal tumors and malignancies and (2) between type I and type II OEC. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method was used for radiomics feature selection. Risk scores were calculated from the Lasso model and were used for survival analysis. For the classification between benign and malignant masses, the MRI radiomics model achieved a high accuracy of 0.90 in the leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation cohort and an accuracy of 0.87 in the independent validation cohort. For the classification between type I and type II subtypes, our method made a satisfactory classification in the LOO cross-validation cohort (accuracy=0.93) and in the independent validation cohort (accuracy=0.84). Low-high-high short-run high gray-level emphasis and low-low-high variance from coronal T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and eccentricity from axial T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) images had the best performance in two classification tasks. The patients with higher risk scores were more likely to have poor prognosis (hazard ratio=4.1694, p=0.001). Our results suggest radiomics features extracted from MRI are highly correlated with OEC classification and prognosis of patients. MRI radiomics can provide survival estimations with high accuracy.                   • The MRI radiomics model could achieve a higher accuracy in discriminating benign ovarian diseases from malignancies. • Low-high-high short-run high gray-level emphasis, low-low-high variance from coronal T2WI, and eccentricity from axial T1WI had the best performance outcomes in various classification tasks. • The ovarian cancer patients with high-risk scores had poor prognosis.","He Zhang,Yunfei Mao,He Zhang,Xiaojun Chen,Yunfei Mao,Guoqing Wu,Xiaojun Chen,Xuefen Liu,Guoqing Wu,Peng Zhang,Xuefen Liu,Yu Bai,Peng Zhang,Yu Bai,Pengcong Lu,Yu Bai,Weigen Yao,Pengcong Lu,Weigen Yao,Yuanyuan Wang,Yuanyuan Wang,Jinhua Yu,Guofu Zhang,Jinhua Yu,Guofu Zhang",European Radiology,2019.0

Radiomic features derived from the medical imaging show great potential to predict prognosis. Here we aim to develop and validate a radiomics nomogram that could predict ER after curative ablation. Total 184 HCC patients treated from August 2007 to August 2014 were included in the study and were divided into the training (n=129) and validation(n=55) cohorts randomly. The endpoint was recurrence free survival (RFS). A set of 647 radiomics features were extracted from the 3 phases contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) images. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm (MRMRA) was used for feature selection. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model was used to build a radiomics signature. Recurrence prediction models were built using clinicopathological factors and radiomics signature, and a prognostic nomogram was developed and validated by calibration. Among the four radiomics models, the portal venous phase model obtained the best performance in the validation subgroup (C-index=0.736 (95%CI:0.726–0.856)). When adding the clinicopathological factors to the models, the portal venous phase combined model also yielded the best predictive performance for training (C-index=0.792(95%CI:0.727–0.857) and validation (C-index=0.755(95%CI:0.651–0.860) subgroup. The combined model indicated a more distinct improvement of predictive power than the simple clinical model (ANOVA, P<0.0001).

However, precise individual-based diagnosis of lesions that result in an adverse motor outcome remains unclear, and an effective method is urgently needed to guide clinical diagnosis and treatment. Advanced radiomics for multiple modalities data can provide a possible look for biomarkers and determine prognosis quantitatively. The study aims to develop and validate a model for prediction of adverse motor outcomes at a corrected age (CA) of 24 months in neonates with PWML.  Methods and analysis  A prospective cohort multicentre study will be conducted in 11 Chinese hospitals. A total of 394 neonates with PWML confirmed by MRI will undergo a clinical assessment (modified Neonatal Behavioural Assessment Scale). At a CA of 18 months, the motor function will be assessed by Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III (Bayley-III). Mild-to-severe motor impairments will be confirmed using the Bayley-III and Gross Motor Function Classification System at a CA of 24 months.

We aimed to develop biomarkers reflecting longitudinal change of radiomic features in NSCLC and evaluate their prognostic power. Fifty-three patients with advanced NSCLC were included. Three primary variables reflecting patterns of longitudinal change were extracted: area under the curve of longitudinal change (AUC1), beta value reflecting slope over time, and AUC2, a value obtained by considering the slope and area over the longitudinal change of features. We constructed models for predicting survival with multivariate cox regression, and identified the performance of these models. AUC2 exhibited an excellent correlation between patterns of longitudinal volume change and a significant difference in overall survival time. Multivariate regression analysis based on cut-off values of radiomic features extracted from baseline CT and AUC2 showed that kurtosis of positive pixel values and surface area from baseline CT, AUC2 of density, skewness of positive pixel values, and entropy at inner portion were associated with overall survival. For the prediction model, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were 0.948 and 0.862 at 1 and 3 years of follow-up, respectively.

However, since lung tumors are subject to substantial motion due to respiration, the stability of radiomic features over the respiratory cycle of the patient needs to be investigated to better evaluate the robustness of the inter-patient feature variability for clinical applications, and its impact in such applications needs to be assessed. A full panel of 841 radiomic features, including tumor intensity, shape, texture, and wavelet features, were extracted from individual phases of a four-dimensional (4D) computed tomography on 20 early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The stability of each radiomic feature was assessed across different phase images of the same patient using the coefficient of variation (COV). The relationship between individual COVs and tumor motion magnitude was inspected. Population COVs, the mean COVs of all 20 patients, were used to evaluate feature motion stability and categorize the radiomic features into 4 different groups. The two extremes, the Very Small group (COV≤5%) and the Large group (COV>20%), each accounted for about a quarter of the features. Shape features were the most stable, with COV≤10% for all features. A clinical study was subsequently conducted using 140 early-stage NSCLC patients. Radiomic features were employed to predict the overall survival with a 500-round bootstrapping. Identical multiple regression model development process was applied, and the model performance was compared between models with and without a feature pre-selection step based on 4D COV to pre-exclude unstable features. Among the systematically tested cutoff values, feature pre-selection with 4D COV≤5% achieved the optimal model performance. The resulting 3-feature radiomic model significantly outperformed its counterpart with no 4D COV pre-selection, with P = 2.16x10-27 in the one-tailed t-test comparing the prediction performances of the two models.","Qian Du,Qian Du,Qian Du,Qian Du,Qian Du,Michael J.

CNN showed the lowest performance in both validation sets. Our results reveal that a combination of radiomic features and MLP network classifier serves a high-performing and generalizable model for classification task for a small dataset with heterogeneous MRI protocols.","Jihye Yun,Jihye Yun,Ji Eun Park,Hyunna Lee,Ji Eun Park,Sungwon Ham,Hyunna Lee,Namkug Kim,Sungwon Ham,Ho Sung Kim,Namkug Kim,Ho Sung Kim",Scientific Reports,2019.0

Various tools for radiomic features extraction are available, and the field gained a substantial scientific momentum for standardization and validation. Radiomics analysis of molecular imaging is expected to provide more comprehensive description of tissues than that of currently used parameters. We here review the workflow of radiomics, the challenges the field currently faces, and its potential for inclusion in clinical decision support systems to maximize disease characterization, and to improve clinical decision-making. We also present guidelines for standardization and implementation of radiomics in order to facilitate its transition to clinical use.","Abdalla Ibrahim,Martin Vallières,Issam El Naqa,Abdalla Ibrahim,Abdalla Mohamed Ibrahim,Martin Vallières,Henry C.

The classification performance can be further improved greatly by exploring and incorporating the discriminative features towards cancer into mathematical models. In this research work, we have developed two radiomics driven likelihood models in Computed Tomography(CT) images to classify lung, colon, head and neck cancer. Initially, two diagnostic radiomic signatures were derived by extracting 105 3-D features from 200 lung nodules and by selecting the features with higher average scores from several supervised as well as unsupervised feature ranking algorithms. The signatures obtained from both the ranking approaches were integrated into two mathematical likelihood functions for tumor classification. Validation of the likelihood functions was performed on 265 public data sets of lung, colon, head and neck cancer with high classification rate. The achieved results show robustness of the models and suggest that diagnostic mathematical functions using general tumor phenotype can be successfully developed for cancer diagnosis.","Hina Shakir,Hina Shakir,Hina Shakir,Yiming Deng,Hina Shakir,Haroon Rasheed,Yiming Deng,Tariq Amin Khan,Haroon Rasheed,Tariq Khan",Scientific Reports,2019.0

Methods and materials: A total of 586 potentially eligible patients were retrospectively enrolled from 4 hospitals (primary cohort and external validation cohort 1~3). Quantitative imaging features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and contrast enhanced T1-weighted imaging before NAC for each patient. With features selected using a coarse to fine feature selection strategy, four radiomic signatures were constructed based on each of the three MRI sequences and their combination. RMM was developed based on the best radiomic signature incorporating with independent clinicopathologic risk factors. The performance of RMM was assessed with respect to its discrimination, and clinical usefulness, and compared with that of clinical information based prediction model. Results: Radiomic signature combining multi-parametric MRI achieved an AUC of 0.79 (the highest among the four radiomic signatures). The signature further achieved good performances in hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative group and triple-negative group. RMM yielded an AUC of 0.86, which was significantly higher than that of clinical model in two of the three external validation cohorts.Conclusion: The study suggested a possibility that RMM provided a potential tool to develop a model for predicting pCR to NAC in breast cancer.","Zhenyu Liu,Zhenyu Liu,Zhenyu Liu,Zhuolin Li,Zhuolin Li,Jinrong Qu,Renzhi Zhang,Jinrong Qu,Renzhi Zhang,Xuezhi Zhou,Xuezhi Zhou,Longfei Li,Longfei Li,Kai Sun,Kai Sun,Zhenchao Tang,Zhenchao Tang,Hui Jiang,Hailiang Li,Hui Jiang,Hailiang Li,Qinmei Xiong,Yingying Ding,Qianqian Xiong,Xinming Zhao,Yingying Ding,Yingying Ding,Kun Wang,Xinming Zhao,Xinming Zhao,Xinming Zhao,Zaiyi Liu,Kun Wang,Kun Wang,Zaiyi Liu,Jie Tian,Jie Tian",Clinical Cancer Research,2019.0

The different radiomic indexes that have been proposed in the literature are described as well as the various factors that have an impact on the robustness of these indexes. We will see that several hundred quantitative features can be extracted per lesion and imaging modality. The ever-growing number of features studied raises the question of the statistical method of analysis used.  This review addresses the research supporting the clinical use of radiomics in oncology in the staging of disease, discrimination between healthy and pathological tissues, the identification of genetic features, the prediction of patient survival, the response to treatment, the recurrence after radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy and the side effects.  Based on the existing literature, it remains difficult to identify features that should be used for current clinical practice.","I. Gardin,I. Gardin,Vincent Grégoire,Isabelle Gardin,I.

Repeatability of test-retest features from helical 4D CT scans, true fast MRI with steady state precession (TRUFISP), and volumetric interpolation breath-hold examination (VIBE) was determined by the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). A workflow was developed to predict overall survival at 12, 18, and 24 months and tumour response at end of treatment for tumour features, and normal muscle tissue features as a control. Texture features were reduced to repeatable and stable features before clustering. Cluster representative feature selection was performed by univariate or medoid analysis before model selection. P-values were corrected for false discovery rate.&#13; Results: Repeatable (CCC ≥ 0.9) features were found for both tumour and normal muscle tissue: CT: 54.4% for tumour and 78.5% for normal tissue, TRUFISP: 64.4% for tumour and 67.8% for normal tissue, and VIBE: 52.6% for tumour and 72.9% for normal muscle tissue. Muscle tissue control analysis found 7 significant models with 6 of 7 models utilizing the univariate representative feature selection technique. Tumour analysis revealed 12 significant models for overall survival and none for tumour response at end of treatment. The accuracy of significant single modality was about the same for MR and CT. Multi-modality tumour models had comparable performance to single modality models.&#13; Conclusion: MR derived texture features may add value to predictive models and should be investigated in a larger cohort. Control analysis demonstrated that the medoid representative feature selection method may result in more robust models.&#13;","R.N. Mahon,Geoffrey D. Hugo,R.N. Mahon,Geoffrey D.

In this study, we focused on the robustness and non-redundancy of radiomic features extracted from computed tomography (CT) scans in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with respect to different tumor segmentation methods. Methods:  Arterial enhanced CT images were retrospectively randomly obtained from 106 patients. As a training data set, 26 HCC patients were used to calculate the features’ reproducibility and redundancy. Another data set (55 HCC patients and 25 healthy volunteers) was used for classification. The GrowCut and GraphCut semiautomatic segmentation methods were implemented in 3D Slicer software by two independent observers, and manual delineation was performed by five abdominal radiation oncologists to acquire the gross tumor volume (GTV). Seventy-one radiomic features were extracted from GTVs using Imaging Biomarker Explorer (IBEX) software, including 17 tumor intensity statistical features, 16 shape features and 38 textural features. For each radiomic feature, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and hierarchical clustering were used to quantify its reproducibility and redundancy. Features with ICC values greater than 0.75 were considered reproducible. To generate the number of non-redundancy feature subgroups, the R2 statistic method was used. Then, a classification model was built using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm with 10-fold cross validation, and area under ROC curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the utility of non-redundant feature extraction by hierarchical clustering. Results:  The percentages of excellent reproducible features in the manual delineation group, GraphCut and GrowCut segmentation group were 69% [49], 73% [52] and 79% [56], respectively. Sixty-five percent [46] of the features showed strong robustness for all segmentation methods. The optimal number of cluster subgroup were 9, 13 and 11 for manual delineation, GraphCut and GrowCut segmentation, respectively. The optimal cluster subgroup number was 6 for all groups when the collectively high reproducibility features were selected for clustering. The ROC analysis of radiomics classification model with and without feature reduction for healthy liver and HCC had an AUC value of 0.857 and 0.721 respectively.  Conclusions:  Our study demonstrates that variations exist in the reproducibility of quantitative imaging features extracted from tumor regions segmented using different methods. The reproducibility and non-redundancy of the radiomic features rely greatly on the tumor segmentation in HCC CT images. We recommend that the most reliable and uniform radiomic features should be selected in the clinical use of radiomics. Classification experiments with feature reduction showed that radiomic features were effective in identifying healthy liver and HCC.","Qingtao Qiu,Qingtao Qiu,Jinghao Duan,Qingtao Qiu,Qingtao Qiu,Zuyun Duan,Jinghao Duan,Jinghao Duan,Xiangwen Meng,Zuyun Duan,Changsheng Ma,Xiangjuan Meng,Jian Zhu,Changsheng Ma,Changsheng Ma,Jian Zhu,Jie Liu,Jian Zhu,Jie Lu,Tonghai Liu,Jie Lu,Tonghai Liu,Yong Yin,Tonghai Liu,Yong Yin,Yong Yin",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,2019.0

Methods Subjects with a group I and subjects with group T without any other lesions were retrospectively evaluated from among patients who received a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan between January 2011 and December 2013. The MRI scans were studied by a consultant radiologist. The subscapularis muscle volume was compared according to the age and sex; the age groups were categorized as patients in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. The volume of subscapularis muscle was measured by three-dimensional reconstructed images acquired through the axial section of 1.5T MRI. Results No statistically significant differences were observed between subscapularis muscle volume of the group I and group T, except for male patients in their 50s (group I: 100,650 mm3 vs. group T: 106,488 mm3) and 60s (group I: 76,347 mm3 vs. group T: 99,549 mm3) (p<0.05). Males had a larger mean volume of subscapularis muscle than females, and the subscapularis muscle volume decreased in a linear manner with increasing age. Conclusions Decrease in subscapularis muscle volume was observed with increasing age, and the impact of supraspinatus tear on subscapularis muscle volume is age and sex dependent.","Yong Cheol Jun,Young Lae Moon,Yong Cheol Jun,Havinder Dev Bhardwaj,Young Lae Moon,Jae Hwan Lim,Havinder Dev Bhardwaj,Dong Hyuk,Jae Hwan Lim,Dong Hyuk Cha",Clinics in Shoulder and Elbow,2019.0

To do this, we applied a trial phases classification inspired from the drug development process. Among the articles we considered for inclusion from PubMed were multimodality AI and radiomics investigations, with a validation analysis aimed at relevant clinical objectives. Quality assessment of selected papers was performed according to the QUADAS-2 criteria. We developed the phases classification criteria for image mining studies. Overall 34,626 articles were retrieved, 300 were selected applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and 171 high-quality papers (QUADAS-2≥7) were identified and analysed. In 27/171 (16%), 141/171 (82%), and 3/171 (2%) studies the development of an AI-based algorithm, radiomics model, and a combined radiomics/AI approach, respectively, was described. A total of 26/27(96%) and 1/27 (4%) AI studies were classified as phase II and III, respectively. Consequently, 13/141 (9%), 10/141 (7%), 111/141 (79%), and 7/141 (5%) radiomics studies were classified as phase 0, I, II, and III, respectively. All three radiomics/AI studies were categorised as phase II trials. The results of the studies are promising but still not mature enough for image mining tools to be implemented in the clinical setting and be widely used. The transfer learning from the well-known drug development process, with some specific adaptations to the image mining discipline could represent the most effective way for radiomics and AI algorithms to become the standard of care tools.","Martina Sollini,Lidija Antunovic,Martina Sollini,Arturo Chiti,Lidija Antunovic,Arturo Chiti,Margarita Kirienko,Margarita Kirienko",European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging,2019.0

Univariate analysis was used to identify clinical and radiomics significant features. Models (radiomics signature, clinical model, and combined model) were evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curve. The models’ performances for prediction of ER were assessed. The radiomics signature was built by 14 selected radiomics features and was significantly associated with ER (P<0.001); the AUCs of the “train set” and the “test set” were 0.818 (95% CI 0.760–0.865) and 0.719 (95% CI 0.621–0.805), respectively.

To investigate the impact of harmonized image reconstructions on feature consistency, a multicenter phantom study was performed using 3-dimensionally printed phantom inserts reflecting realistic tumor shapes and heterogeneity uptakes. Methods: Tumors extracted from real PET/CT scans of patients with non-small cell lung cancer served as model for three 3-dimensionally printed inserts. Different heterogeneity pattern were realized by printing separate compartments that could be filled with different activity solutions. The inserts were placed in the National Electrical Manufacturers Association image-quality phantom and scanned various times. First, a list-mode scan was acquired and 5 statistically equal replicates were reconstructed. Second, the phantom was scanned 4 times on the same scanner. Third, the phantom was scanned on 6 PET/CT systems. All images were reconstructed using EANM Research Ltd. (EARL)-compliant and locally clinically preferred reconstructions. EARL-compliant reconstructions were performed without (EARL1) or with (EARL2) point-spread function. Images were analyzed with and without resampling to 2-mm cubic voxels. Images were discretized with a fixed bin width (FBW) of 0.25 and a fixed bin number (FBN) of 64. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of each scan setup was calculated and compared across reconstruction settings. An ICC above 0.75 was regarded as high. Results: The percentage of features yielding a high ICC was largest for the statistically equal replicates (70%-91% for FBN; 90%-96% for FBW discretization). For scans acquired on the same system, the percentage decreased, but most features still resulted in a high ICC (FBN, 52%-63%; FBW, 75%-85%). The percentage of features yielding a high ICC decreased more in the multicenter setting. In this case, the percentage of features yielding a high ICC was larger for images reconstructed with EARL-compliant reconstructions: for example, 40% for EARL1 and 60% for EARL2 versus 21% for the clinically preferred setting for FBW discretization. When discretized with FBW and resampled to isotropic voxels, this benefit was more pronounced. Conclusion: EARL-compliant reconstructions harmonize a wide range of radiomic features. FBW discretization and a sampling to isotropic voxels enhances the benefits of EARL-compliant reconstructions.","Elisabeth Pfaehler,Joyce van Sluis,Elisabeth Pfaehler,Joyce van Sluis,B.J.

In this IRB-approved and HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, 37 pairs of scans from 37 unique patients who underwent CECTs within a 2-week interval were included in the analysis of the reproducibility of features derived from pancreatic parenchyma, and a subset of 18 pairs of scans were further analyzed for the reproducibility of features derived from PDAC. In each patient, pancreatic parenchyma and pancreatic tumor (when present) were manually segmented by two radiologists independently. A total of 266 radiomic features were extracted from the pancreatic parenchyma and tumor region and also the volume and diameter of the tumor. The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was calculated to assess feature reproducibility for each patient in three scenarios: (1) different radiologists, same CECT; (2) same radiologist, different CECTs; and (3) different radiologists, different CECTs. Among pancreatic parenchyma-derived features, using a threshold of CCC>0.90, 58/266 (21.8%) and 48/266 (18.1%) features met the threshold for scenario 1, 14/266 (5.3%) and 15/266 (5.6%) for scenario 2, and 14/266 (5.3%) and 10/266 (3.8%) for scenario 3. Among pancreatic tumor-derived features, 11/268 (4.1%) and 17/268 (6.3%) features met the threshold for scenario 1, 1/268 (0.4%) and 5/268 (1.9%) features met the threshold for scenario 2, and no features for scenario 3 met the threshold, respectively. Variations between CECT scans affected radiomic feature reproducibility to a greater extent than variation in segmentation. A smaller number of pancreatic tumor-derived radiomic features were reproducible compared with pancreatic parenchyma-derived radiomic features under the same conditions.                   • For pancreatic-derived radiomic features from contrast-enhanced CT (CECT), fewer than 25% are reproducible (with a threshold of CCC<0.9) in a clinical heterogeneous dataset. • Variations between CECT scans affected the number of reproducible radiomic features to a greater extent than variations in radiologist segmentation. • A smaller number of pancreatic tumor-derived radiomic features were reproducible compared with pancreatic parenchyma-derived radiomic features under the same conditions.","Rikiya Yamashita,Rikiya Yamashita,Rikiya Yamashita,Thomas Perrin,Thomas Perrin,Jayasree Chakraborty,Jayasree Chakraborty,Joanne F.

We have observed an exponential increase in the number of exams performed, subspecialization of medical fields, and increases in accuracy of the various imaging methods, making it a challenge for the radiologist to ""know everything about all exams and regions"". In addition, imaging exams are no longer only qualitative and diagnostic, providing now quantitative information on disease severity, as well as identifying biomarkers of prognosis and treatment response. In view of this, computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed with the objective of complementing diagnostic imaging and helping the therapeutic decision-making process. With the advent of artificial intelligence, ""big data"", and machine learning, we are moving toward the rapid expansion of the use of these tools in daily life of physicians, making each patient unique, as well as leading radiology toward the concept of multidisciplinary approach and precision medicine.

This study aimed to explore a radiomic model for preoperatively prediction of ETE in patients with PTC. Methods The study included 624 PTC patients (without ETE, n = 448; with minimal ETE, n = 52; with gross ETE, n = 124) whom were divided randomly into training (n = 437) and validation (n = 187) cohorts; all data were gathered between January 2016 and November 2017. Radiomic features were extracted from computed tomography (CT) images of PTCs. Key radiomic features were identified and incorporated into a radiomic signature. Combining the radiomic signature with clinical risk factors, a radiomic nomogram was constructed using multivariable logistic regression. Delong test was used to compare different receiver operating characteristic curves. Results Five key radiomic features were incorporated into the radiomic signature, which was significantly associated with ETE (p < 0.001 for both cohorts) and slightly better than clinical model integrating significant clinical risk factors in the training cohort (AUC, 0.791 vs. 0.778; F1, 0.729 vs. 0.714) and validation cohort (AUC, 0.772 vs. 0.756; F1, 0.710 vs. 0.692).

Methods  A single-center prospective trial was conducted from March 2015 to March 2017 including all consecutive adult spina bifida patients seen for urodynamic testing. A contrast-enhanced abdominal CT was systematically performed in all patients during the same visit. Texture features of the bladder wall related to the gray-level histogram and gray-level co-occurrence were evaluated on CT images. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of poor bladder compliance (PBC) and detrusor overactivity (DO) among clinical and texture parameters.    Results  Fourty patients were included. The Lasso penalized logistic regression analysis identified two texture parameters as potential predictors of poor bladder compliance: Skewness (coefficient weight, -1.81) and S.1.1.SumVarnc (coefficient weight, -3.52). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis confirmed skewness (OR (CI 95%)=0.40 (0.14, 0.97), p=0.04) as an independent predictor of PBC. The Lasso penalized logistic regression analysis identified one texture parameters as potential predictor of DO: Kurtosis (coefficient weight, -3.52). which was confirmed in multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR (CI 95%)=1.12 (1.01, 1.55), p=0.02.

This study aims to explore relationships between CT imaging radiomics features and gene expression data in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Eighty-nine NSCLC patients are included in the study. Radiomics features are extracted and selected to quantify the phenotype of tumors on CT-scans. Co-expressed genes are also clustered and the first principal component of the cluster is represented, which is defined as a metagene. Then, statistical analysis was performed to assess association of CT radiomics features with metagenes. In addition, predictive models are built and metagene enrichment are conducted to further evaluate performance of NSCLC radiogenomics statistically and biologically. RESULTS: There are 187 significant pairwise correlations between a CT radiomics feature and a metagene of NSCLC, where eighteen metagenes are annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) terms. Metagenes are predicted in terms of radiomics features with an accuracy of 41.89% -89.93%. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the associations between CT imaging radiomics features and NSCLC co-expressed gene sets. The findings suggest that CT radiomics features can reflect important biological information of NSCLC patients, which may have a significant clinical impact as CT is routinely used in clinical practice, assisting in improving medical decision-support at low cost.","Ting Wang,Ting Wang,Jing Gong,Jing Gong,Huihong Duan,Jing Gong,Jing Gong,Lijia Wang,Hui-Hong Duan,Lijia Wang,Xiaodan Ye,Shengdong Nie,Xiao-Dan Ye,Shengdong Nie,Shengdong Nie",Journal of X-ray Science and Technology,2019.0

It has its underpinning in the identification of biomarkers with diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive values. Nowadays, the concept of biomarker no longer necessarily corresponds to biological characteristics measured ex vivo but includes complex physiological characteristics acquired by different technologies. Positron-emission-tomography (PET) imaging is an integral part of this approach by enabling the fine characterization of tumor heterogeneity in vivo in a non-invasive way. It can effectively be assessed by exploring the heterogeneous distribution and uptake of a tracer such as 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) or by using multiple radiopharmaceuticals, each providing different information. These two approaches represent two avenues of development for the research of new biomarkers in oncology.

In particular, considering the biomedical field, quantitative imaging methods are increasingly gaining importance since they convey scientifically and clinically relevant information for prediction, prognosis, and treatment response assessment. In this context, radiomic approaches are fostering large-scale studies that can have a significant impact in the clinical practice. In this work, we focus on Haralick features, the most common and clinically relevant descriptors. These features are based on the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), whose computation is considerably intensive on images characterized by a high bit-depth (e.g., 16 bits), as in the case of medical images that convey detailed visual information. We propose here HaraliCU, an efficient strategy for the computation of the GLCM and the extraction of an exhaustive set of the Haralick features. HaraliCU was conceived to exploit the parallel computation capabilities of modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), allowing us to achieve up to \(\sim \!20\times \) speed-up with respect to the corresponding C++ coded sequential version.

This retrospective study includes 99 pregnant women with pathologically confirmed placental invasion and 56 pregnant women with simple placenta previa. All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging after 24 gestational weeks. The placenta was segmented in sagittal images from both turbo spin echo (TSE) and balanced turbo field echo (bTFE) sequences. Textural features were extracted from the both original and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)-filtered MRI images. An automated machine learning algorithm was applied to the extracted feature sets to obtain the optimal preprocessing steps, classification algorithm, and corresponding hyper-parameters. A gradient boosting classifier using all textual features from original and LoG-filtered TSE images and bTFE images identified by the automated machine learning algorithm achieved the optimal performance with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under ROC curve (AUC) of 100%, 88.5%, 95.2%, and 0.98 in the prediction of placental invasion. In addition, textural features that contributed to the prediction of placental invasion differ from the features significantly affected by normal placenta maturation. Quantifying intraplacental heterogeneity using LoG filtration and texture analysis highlights the different heterogeneous appearance caused by abnormal placentation relative to normal maturation. The predictive model derived from automated machine learning yielded good performance, indicating the proposed radiomic analysis pipeline can accurately predict placental invasion and facilitate clinical decision-making for pregnant women with suspicious placental invasion. • The intraplacental texture features have high efficiency in prediction of invasive placentation after 24 gestational weeks. • The features with dominated predictive power did not overlap with the features significantly affected by gestational age.","Huaiqiang Sun,Haibo Qu,Huaiqiang Sun,Lu Chen,Haibo Qu,Haibo Qu,Haibo Qu,Wei Wang,Lu Chen,Lu Chen,Lu Chen,Lu Chen,Wei Wang,Yi Liao,Wei Wang,Wei Wang,Wei Wang,Wei Wang,Yi Liao,Yi Liao,Ling Zou,Yi Liao,Ziyi Zhou,Ling Zou,Ziyi Zhou,Xiaodong Wang,Xiaodong Wang,Shu Zhou,Shu Zhou",European Radiology,2019.0

This study aimed to develop a clinical-translatable radiomics nomogram for reducing the FPR of PET/CT in lung cancer diagnosis, and to determine the impact of integrating manual diagnosis to the performance of the radiomics nomogram. Among 3,947 18F-FDG PET/CT-screened patients with lung lesion, 157 malignant and 111 benign patients were retrospectively enrolled and divided into training and test cohorts. The data of manual diagnosis were recorded. A total of 4,338 features were extracted from CT, thin-section CT, PET and PET/CT, and the four radiomics signatures (RS) were then generated by LASSO method. Radiomics prediction nomogram integrating imaging-based RS and manual diagnosis was developed using multivariable logistic regression. The performances of RS and prediction nomograms were independently validated through key discrimination index and clinical benefit. The FPR of manual diagnosis was found to be 30.6%. Among the four RS, PET/CT RS exhibited the best performance. By integrating manual diagnosis, the hybrid nomogram integrating PET/CT RS and manual diagnosis demonstrated lowest FPR and highest area under curve (AUC) and Youden index (YI) in both training and test cohorts (FPR: 5.4% and 9.1%, AUC: 0.98 and 0.92, YI: 85.8% and 75.5%, respectively). This hybrid nomogram respectively corrected 78.6% and 37.5% among FPR cases produced by PET/CT RS, without significantly sacrificing its sensitivity. The net benefit of hybrid nomogram appeared highest at <85% threshold probability. The established hybrid nomogram integrating PET/CT RS and manual diagnosis can significantly reduce FPR, improve diagnostic accuracy and enhance clinical benefit compared to manual diagnosis. By integrating manual diagnosis, the performance of this hybrid nomogram is superior to PET/CT RS, indicating the importance of clinicians’ judgement as an essential information source for improving radiomics diagnostic approaches.","Fei Kang,Fei Kang,Wei Mu,Wei Mu,Wei Mu,Jie Gong,Jie Gong,Jie Gong,Jie Gong,Shengjun Wang,Shengjun Wang,Guoquan Li,Shengjun Wang,Shengjun Wang,Guoquan Li,Guiyu Li,Wei Qin,Guiyu Li,Wei Qin,Jie Tian,Wei Qin,Wei Qin,Jing Wang,Jie Tian,Jing Wang",European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging,2019.0

A total of 208 radiomics features were extracted for each patient from a database of 303 patients. The patients were split into the training and validation cohorts according to their pretreatment diagnosis date. The radiomics feature analysis consisted of cluster analysis and prognosis model analysis for disease free-survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS). Additionally, two prognosis models using clinical features only and combined radiomics and clinical features were generated to estimate the incremental prognostic value of radiomics features. Patients were clustered by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) into two groups. It showed high correspondence with patients’ T stage (p<0.00001) and overall stage information (p<0.00001) by chi-squared tests. There were significant differences in DFS (p=0.0052), OS (p=0.033), and LRFS (p=0.037) between the two clustered groups but not in DMFS (p=0.11) by log-rank tests. Radiomics nomograms that incorporated radiomics and clinical features could estimate DFS with the C-index of 0.751 [0.639, 0.863] and OS with the C-index of 0.845 [0.752, 0.939] in the validation cohort. The nomograms improved the prediction accuracy with the C-index value of 0.029 for DFS and 0.107 for OS compared with clinical features only.

In this study we investigated the association between radiomic features extracted from multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI)of prostate cancer (PCa) and the tumor histologic subtypes (using Gleason Score) using machine learning algorithms, in order to identify which of the mp-MRI derived radiomic features can distinguish high and low risk PCa.","Danila Germanese,Sara Colantonio,Danila Germanese,Sara Colantonio,Claudia Caudai,Sara Colantonio,Claudia Caudai,Claudia Caudai,Claudia Caudai,Maria Antonietta Pascali,Maria Antonietta Pascali,Maria Antonietta Pascali,Andrea Barucci,Andrea Barucci,Nicola Zoppetti,S.

One hundred fifty lung nodules among 114 screen-detected, incident lung cancer patients from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) were investigated. Volume double time (VDT) was calculated as the difference between continuous two scans and used to define indolent and aggressive lung cancers. Lung nodules were semi-automatically segmented using lung and mediastinal windows separately, and subtracting the mediastinal window region from the lung window region generated the difference region. 364 radiomic features were separately exacted from nodules using the lung window, the mediastinal window and the difference region. Multivariable models were conducted to identify the most predictive features in predicting tumor growth. Clinical information was also obtained from the database. Based on our definition, 26% of the cases were indolent lung cancer. The tumor growth pattern could be predicted by radiomic models constructed using features obtained in the lung window, the difference region, and by combining features obtained in both the lung window and difference regions with areas under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROCs) of 0.799, 0.819, and 0.846, respectively. The multi-window feature model showed better performance compared to single window features (P<0.001). Incorporating clinical factors into the multi-window feature models showed improvement, yielding an accuracy of 84.67% and AUROC of 0.855 for distinguishing indolent from aggressive disease. Multi-window CT based radiomics features are valuable predictors of indolent lung cancers and out performed single CT window setting. Combining clinical information improved predicting performance.","Hong Lü,Wei Mu,Hong Lu,Wei Mu,Yoganand Balagurunathan,Jin Qi,Yoganand Balagurunathan,Jin Qi,Mahmoud A.

10.1016/j.jmir.2019.07.010,31447230.0,,Personalized Breast Cancer Treatments Using Artificial Intelligence in Radiomics and Pathomics.,"Abstract   Progress in computing power and advances in medical imaging over recent decades have culminated in new opportunities for artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, and using radiomics to facilitate clinical decision-making. These opportunities are growing in medical specialties, such as radiology, pathology, and oncology. As medical imaging and pathology are becoming increasingly digitized, it is recently recognized that harnessing data from digital images can yield parameters that reflect the underlying biology and physiology of various malignancies. This greater understanding of the behaviour of cancer can potentially improve on therapeutic strategies. In addition, the use of AI is particularly appealing in oncology to facilitate the detection of malignancies, to predict the likelihood of tumor response to treatments, and to prognosticate the patients' risk of cancer-related mortality. AI will be critical for identifying candidate biomarkers from digital imaging and developing robust and reliable predictive models. These models will be used to personalize oncologic treatment strategies, and identify confounding variables that are related to the complex biology of tumors and diversity of patient-related factors (ie, mining “big data”). This commentary describes the growing body of work focussed on AI for precision oncology. Advances in AI-driven computer vision and machine learning are opening new pathways that can potentially impact patient outcomes through response-guided adaptive treatments and targeted therapies based on radiomic and pathomic analysis.","William T.

We aim to develop a nomogram incorporating radiomics and the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) for predicting breast cancer in BI-RADS ultrasound (US) category 4 or 5 lesions. From January 2017 to August 2018, a total of 315 pathologically proven breast lesions were included. Patients from the study population were divided into a training group (n=211) and a validation group (n=104) according to a cut-off date of March 1st, 2018. Each lesion was assigned a category (4A, 4B, 4C or 5) according to the second edition of the American College of Radiology (ACR) BI-RADS US. A radiomics score was generated from the US image. A nomogram was developed based on the results of multivariate regression analysis from the training group. Discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness of the nomogram for predicting breast cancer were assessed in the validation group. The radiomics score included 9 selected radiomics features. The radiomics score and BI-RADS category were independently associated with breast malignancy. The nomogram incorporating the radiomics score and BI-RADS category showed better discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.928; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.876, 0.980) between malignant and benign lesions than either the radiomics score (P=0.029) or BI-RADS category (P=0.011). The nomogram demonstrated good calibration and clinical usefulness. In conclusion, the nomogram combining the radiomics score and BI-RADS category is potentially useful for predicting breast malignancy in BI-RADS US category 4 or 5 lesions.","Weiquan Luo,Wei-quan Luo,Qing-xiu Huang,Xiaowen Huang,Qing-xiu Huang,Xiao-wen Huang,Hang-Tong Hu,Hang-tong Hu,Fuqiang Zeng,Wei Wang,Fu-qiang Zeng,Wei Wang,Wei Wang,Wei Wang",Scientific Reports,2019.0
10.3389/fendo.2019.00403,,,Preoperative Noninvasive Radiomics Approach Predicts Tumor Consistency in Patients With Acromegaly: Development and Multicenter Prospective Validation.,"Background: Prediction of the tumor consistency before surgery is of vital importance to determine individualized therapeutic schemes for patients with acromegaly. The present study was performed to noninvasively predict the tumor consistency based on magnetic resonance imaging and radiomics analysis. Methods: In total, 158 patients with acromegaly were randomized into the primary cohort (n = 100) and validation cohort (n = 58). The consistency of the tumor was classified as soft or firm according to the neurosurgeon’s evaluation. The critical radiomics features were determined using the elastic net feature selection algorithm, and the radiomics signature was constructed. The most valuable clinical characteristics were then selected based on the multivariable logistic regression analysis. Next, a radiomics model was developed using the radiomics signature and clinical characteristics, and 30 patients with acromegaly were recruited for prospective validation of the radiomics model. The model’s performance was evaluated based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, and other associated classification measures. Its calibration, discriminating capacity, and clinical usefulness were also evaluated. Results: The radiomics signature established according to four radiomics characteristics screened in the primary cohort exhibited excellent discriminatory capacity in the validation cohort. The radiomics model, which incorporated both the radiomics signature and Knosp grade, displayed favorable discriminatory capacity and calibration, and the AUC was 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.85) and 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.78–0.83) in the primary and validation cohorts, respectively. Furthermore, compared with the clinical characteristics, the as-constructed radiomics model more effectively predicted the tumor consistency in patients with acromegaly. Moreover, the prospective validation and decision curve analysis suggested that the radiomics model was clinically useful. Conclusions: This radiomics model can assist neurosurgeons in predicting the tumor consistency in patients with acromegaly before surgery and facilitate the determination of individualized therapeutic schemes.","Yanghua Fan,Yanghua Fan,Hua Min,Anna Mou,Min Hua,Minxian Wu,Anna Mou,Miaojing Wu,Xiaohai Liu,Xiaohai Liu,Xinjie Bao,Xinjie Bao,Renzhi Wang,Ming Feng,Renzhi Wang,Renzhi Wang,Ming Feng",Frontiers in Endocrinology,2019.0

Clinical imaging methods include abdominal ultrasound (US) used mostly for HCC screening/surveillance and imaging-guided biopsies, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) used for confident diagnosis of typical HCC tumors without histologic confirmation, according to practice guidelines. Qualitative HCC imaging appearance is closely linked to its vascular characteristics, with typical imaging features such as hyperenhancement during the arterial phase relative to the surrounding liver parenchyma and washout in portal venous or delayed venous phases post-contrast on CT and MRI. There is recent growing interest in assessing tissue properties using quantitative imaging. Several quantitative imaging methods have been developed with the common goal of improved tumor characterization and prediction of aggressiveness in order to achieve precise and personalized management of HCC. New techniques, such as radiomics, have been proposed as surrogate for histologic examination, avoiding tissue sampling risks and allowing repetitive measurements of the entire tumor volume. Furthermore, with the emergence of molecular targeted therapy, noninvasive imaging techniques allowing early assessment of therapeutic efficacy are necessary.","Naïk Vietti Violi,Naik Vietti Violi,Naik Vietti Violi,Naik Vietti Violi,Sara Lewis,Sara Lewis,Stefanie Hectors,Daniela Said,Stefanie J.

Methods: One hundred and forty patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 80) and a validation cohort (n = 60). A total of 970 radiomic features were extracted from pretreatment magnetic resonance (MR) images of NPC patients from May 2007 to December 2013. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used for selecting radiomic features associated with local recurrence, and multivariate analyses was used for building radiomic nomogram. Results: Eight contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CET1-w) image features and seven T2-weighted (T2-w) image features were selected to build a Cox proportional hazard model in the training cohort, respectively. The radiomic nomogram, which combined radiomic features and multiple clinical variables, had a good evaluation ability (C-index: 0.74 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.85]) in the validation cohort. The radiomic nomogram successfully categorized those patients into low- and high-risk groups with significant differences in the rate of local recurrence-free survival (P <0.05).

Methods: This retrospective study included 106 patients treated with an irradiation stent for UPC-MBO. These patients were randomly divided into a training group (74 patients) and a validation group (32 patients). A clinical model for predicting restenosis-free survival (RFS) was developed with clinical predictors selected by univariate and multivariate analyses. After integrating the radiomics signature, a combined model was constructed to predict RFS. The predictive performance was evaluated with the concordance index (C-index) in both the training and validation groups. The median risk score of progression in the training group was used to divide patients into high- and low-risk subgroups. Results: Radiomics features were integrated with clinical predictors to develop a combined model. The predictive performance was better in the combined model (C-index, 0.791 and 0.779 in the training and validation groups, respectively) than in the clinical model (C-index, 0.673 and 0.667 in the training and validation groups, respectively).

However, the criteria used for tumor staging and surveillance are largely based on anatomic criteria at this time. From a quantitative standpoint, the evaluation in the clinical setting remains very basic in many instances, largely relying on measurement of size on initial assessment and for the evaluation of response to treatment, supplemented with qualitative assessment of other tumor characteristics such as homogeneity and shape [1,2]. This is not without basis, since size measurements are easy to make and these criteria can be universally implemented and used using basic platforms for image display and analysis, without the need for more complicated infrastructure or analytic platforms that may not be widely available. However, the downside is that there is potential for under-utilization, or wasting, of substantial information that could potentially be used for improvement in tumor evaluation and treatment planning for oncology patients. Broadly, texture analysis and radiomics approaches aim to fill this gap, extracting and analyzing the higher dimensional and quantitative data with the aim of more accurate, tumor specific evaluation and characterization [3,4]. Coupled with artificial intelligence (AI), these can serve as biomarkers and can be used to construct prediction models that have the potential to provide an evaluation far beyond what is achieved using the largely qualitative approaches to image evaluation currently performed in the clinical setting. Increasing evidence suggests that these approaches can be used to enhance non-invasive tumor characterization, including prediction of certain tumor molecular features, association with tumor spread, better prediction of treatment response and prognosis [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]], and this constitutes one area of great interest and significant research among the broader potential medical applications of AI that extend far beyond oncology or evaluation of medical images alone.

The article will review the fundamentals of these approaches and commonly used techniques, followed by a review of selected examples to illustrate how these techniques can be applied for oncologic evaluation.

The larynx represents a unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for clinicians due to its complex tridimensional anatomical structure. Its complex regional and functional anatomy makes it necessary to enhance our diagnostic tools in order to improve decision-making protocols, aimed at better survival and functional results.

This review aims to assess whether radiomics is a useful and reproducible method for clinical management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of current radiomics literature pertaining specifically to HCC. From an initial set of 48 articles recovered through database searches, 23 articles were retained to be included in this review after full screening. Among these 23 studies, 7 used a radiomics approach in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Only two studies applied radiomics to positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET–CT). In the remaining 14 articles, a radiomics analysis was performed on computed tomography (CT). Eight studies dealt with the relationship between biological signatures and imaging findings, and can be classified as radiogenomic studies. For each study included in our review, we computed a Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) as proposed by Lambin et al. We found that the RQS (mean ± standard deviation) was 8.35 ± 5.38 (out of a possible maximum value of 36). Although these scores are fairly low, and radiomics has not yet reached clinical utility in HCC, it is important to underscore the fact that these early studies pave the way for the radiomics field with a focus on HCC. Radiomics is still a very young field, and is far from being mature, but it remains a very promising technology for the future for developing adequate personalized treatment as a non-invasive approach, for complementing or replacing tumor biopsies, as well as for developing novel prognostic biomarkers in HCC patients.","Taiga Wakabayashi,Taiga Wakabayashi,Farid Ouhmich,Cristians Gonzalez-Cabrera,Farid Ouhmich,Cristians Gonzalez-Cabrera,Emanuele Felli,Emanuele Felli,Antonio Saviano,Vincent Agnus,Antonio Saviano,Vincent Agnus,Vincent Agnus,Peter Savadjiev,Thomas F.

The radiomics analysis process included tumor segmentation, feature extraction, data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, modeling and model evaluation. A total of 1044 sets of texture feature parameters were extracted, and 21 methods were used for the radiomics analysis. All research methods could be used to diagnose MVI. Of all the methods, the LASSO+GBDT method had the highest accuracy, the LASSO+RF method had the highest sensitivity, the LASSO+BPNet method had the highest specificity, and the LASSO+GBDT method had the highest AUC. Through Z-tests of the AUCs, LASSO+GBDT, LASSO+K-NN, LASSO+RF, PCA+DT, and PCA+RF had Z-values greater than 1.96 (p<0.05).

10.5152/dir.2019.19321,31650960.0,,Radiomics with artificial intelligence: a practical guide for beginners.,"Radiomics is a relatively new word for the field of radiology, meaning the extraction of a high number of quantitative features from medical images. Artificial intelligence (AI) is broadly a set of advanced computational algorithms that basically learn the patterns in the data provided to make predictions on unseen data sets. Radiomics can be coupled with AI because of its better capability of handling a massive amount of data compared with the traditional statistical methods. Together, the primary purpose of these fields is to extract and analyze as much and meaningful hidden quantitative data as possible to be used in decision support. Nowadays, both radiomics and AI have been getting attention for their remarkable success in various radiological tasks, which has been met with anxiety by most of the radiologists due to the fear of replacement by intelligent machines. Considering ever-developing advances in computational power and availability of large data sets, the marriage of humans and machines in future clinical practice seems inevitable. Therefore, regardless of their feelings, the radiologists should be familiar with these concepts. Our goal in this paper was three-fold: first, to familiarize radiologists with the radiomics and AI; second, to encourage the radiologists to get involved in these ever-developing fields; and, third, to provide a set of recommendations for good practice in design and assessment of future works.","Burak Koçak,Burak Kocak,Emine Şebnem Durmaz,Ece Ateş,Emine Şebnem Durmaz,Emine Sebnem Durmaz,Ece Ates,Özgür Kılıçkesmez,Ozgur Kilickesmez",Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology,2019.0

However, as like any radiomic features, peritumoral features could also be unstable and/or nonreproducible. Hence, the purpose of this study was to assess the stability and reproducibility of computed tomography (CT) radiomic features extracted from the peritumoral regions of lung lesions where stability was defined as the consistency of a feature by different segmentations, and reproducibility was defined as the consistency of a feature to different image acquisitions. METHODS: Stability was measured utilizing the ""moist run"" dataset and reproducibility was measured utilizing the Reference Image Database to Evaluate Therapy Response test-retest dataset. Peritumoral radiomic features were extracted from incremental distances of 3-12mm outside the tumor segmentation. A total of 264 statistical, histogram, and texture radiomic features were assessed from the selected peritumoral region-of-interests (ROIs). All features (except wavelet texture features) were extracted using standardized algorithms defined by the Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative. Stability and reproducibility of features were assessed using the concordance correlation coefficient. The clinical utility of stable and reproducible peritumoral features was tested in three previously published lung cancer datasets using overall survival as the endpoint. RESULTS: Features found to be stable and reproducible, regardless of the peritumoral distances, included statistical, histogram, and a subset of texture features suggesting that these features are less affected by changes (e.g., size or shape) of the peritumoral region due to different segmentations and image acquisitions. The stability and reproducibility of Laws and wavelet texture features were inconsistent across all peritumoral distances. The analyses also revealed that a subset of features were consistently stable irrespective of the initial parameters (e.g., seed point) for a given segmentation algorithm. No significant differences were found in stability for features that were extracted from ROIs bounded by a lung parenchyma mask versus ROIs that were not bounded by a lung parenchyma mask (i.e., peritumoral regions that extended outside of lung parenchyma). After testing the clinical utility of peritumoral features, stable and reproducible features were shown to be more likely to create repeatable models than unstable and nonreproducible features. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a subset of stable and reproducible CT radiomic features extracted from the peritumoral region of lung lesions. The stable and reproducible features identified in this study could be applied to a feature selection pipeline for CT radiomic analyses. According to our findings, top performing features in survival models were more likely to be stable and reproducible hence, it may be best practice to utilize them to achieve repeatable studies and reduce the chance of overfitting.","Ilke Tunali,Lawrence O.

For this purpose, a cylindrical homogeneous phantom filled with 177Lu was used and a total of 24 spherical volumes of interest (VOIs) were considered inside the phantom. The location of the VOIs was chosen in order to define two different configurations, i.e. gravity and radial configuration. The former configuration was used to investigate the uniformity of distribution of 177Lu inside the phantom, while the latter configuration was used to investigate the lack of uniformity from center towards edge of the images. For each VOI, the trend of different texture features considered as a function of 3D-OSEM updates was investigated in order to evaluate the influence of reconstruction parameters. TA was performed using CGITA software. The equality of the average texture feature trends in both spatial configurations was assumed as the null hypothesis and was tested by functional analysis of variance (fANOVA). With regard to the gravity configuration, no texture feature rejected the null hypothesis when the number of subsets increased. For the radial configuration, the statistical analysis revealed that, depending on the 3D-OSEM parameters used, a few texture features were capable of detecting the non-uniformity of 177Lu distribution inside the phantom moving from the center of the image towards its edge. Finally, cross-correlation coefficients were calculated to better identify the features that could play an important role in assessing quality assurance procedures performed on SPECT systems.","Anna Sarnelli,Anna Sarnelli,Emilio Mezzenga,E.

10.1088/1361-6560/ab326a,31307017.0,,predicting lung nodule malignancies by combining deep convolutional neural network and handcrafted features,"To predict lung nodule malignancy with a high sensitivity and specificity for low dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening, we propose a fusion algorithm that combines handcrafted features (HF) into the features learned at the output layer of a 3D deep convolutional neural network (CNN). First, we extracted twenty-nine HF, including nine intensity features, eight geometric features, and twelve texture features based on grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). We then trained 3D CNNs modified from three 2D CNN architectures (AlexNet, VGG-16 Net and Multi-crop Net) to extract the CNN features learned at the output layer. For each 3D CNN, the CNN features combined with the 29 HF were used as the input for the support vector machine (SVM) coupled with the sequential forward feature selection (SFS) method to select the optimal feature subset and construct the classifiers. The fusion algorithm takes full advantage of the HF and the highest level CNN features learned at the output layer. It can overcome the disadvantage of the HF that may not fully reflect the unique characteristics of a particular lesion by combining the intrinsic CNN features. Meanwhile, it also alleviates the requirement of a large scale annotated dataset for the CNNs based on the complementary of HF. The patient cohort includes 431 malignant nodules and 795 benign nodules extracted from the LIDC/IDRI database. For each investigated CNN architecture, the proposed fusion algorithm achieved the highest AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity scores among all competitive classification models.","Shulong Li,Panpan Xu,Bin Li,Liyuan Chen,Zhiguo Zhou,Hongxia Hao,Yingying Duan,Michael R.

Our aim was to determine if we could identify radiomic predictors from PET/CT in breast cancer patient therapeutic efficacy prior to NAC. This retrospective study included 100 breast cancer patients who received NAC; there were 2210 PET/CT radiomic features extracted. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning models were used to identify the prognostic radiomic predictors through the following: (1) selection of the significant (p<0.05) imaging features from consensus clustering and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test; (2) selection of the most discriminative features via univariate random forest (Uni-RF) and the Pearson correlation matrix (PCM); and (3) determination of the most predictive features from a traversal feature selection (TFS) based on a multivariate random forest (RF). The prediction model was constructed with RF and then validated with 10-fold cross-validation for 30 times and then independently validated. The performance of the radiomic predictors was measured in terms of area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). The PET/CT radiomic predictors achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.857 (AUC=0.844) on the training split set and 0.767 (AUC=0.722) on the independent validation set. When age was incorporated, the accuracy for the split set increased to 0.857 (AUC=0.958) and 0.8 (AUC=0.73) for the independent validation set and both outperformed the clinical prediction model. We also found a close association between the radiomic features, receptor expression, and tumor T stage. Radiomic predictors from pre-treatment PET/CT scans when combined with patient age were able to predict pCR after NAC. We suggest that these data will be valuable for patient management.","Panli Li,Panli Li,Xiuying Wang,Xiuying Wang,Chong-Rui Xu,Chongrui Xu,Cheng Liu,Chaojie Zheng,Cheng Liu,Chaojie Zheng,Michael Fulham,Michael J Fulham,David Dagan Feng,Dagan Feng,Michael J Fulham,Michael J.

Preoperative DECT images were retrospectively collected from 204 pathologically confirmed cases of gastric adenocarcinoma (mean age, 58years; range, 28–81years; 157 men [mean age, 60years; range, 28–81years] and 47 women [mean age, 54years; range, 28–79years]) between November 2011 and October 2018, They were divided into training (n=136) and test (n=68) sets. Radiomics features were extracted from monochromatic images at arterial phase (AP) and venous phase (VP). Clinical information, CT parameters, and follow-up data were collected. A radiomics nomogram for LNM prediction was built using deep learning approach and evaluated in test set using ROC analysis. Its prognostic performance was determined with Harrell’s concordance index (C-index) based on patients’ outcomes. The dual-energy CT radiomics signature was associated with LNM in two sets (Mann-Whitney U test, p<0.001) and an achieved area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.71 for AP and 0.76 for VP in test set. The nomogram incorporated the two radiomics signatures and CT-reported lymph node status exhibited AUCs of 0.84 in the training set and 0.82 in the test set. The C-indices of the nomogram for progression-free survival and overall survival prediction were 0.64 (p=0.004) and 0.67 (p=0.002). The DECT-based deep learning radiomics nomogram showed good performance in predicting LNM in gastric cancer. Furthermore, it was significantly associated with patients’ prognosis.                   • This study investigated the value of deep learning dual-energy CT–based radiomics in predicting lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer.  • The dual-energy CT–based radiomics nomogram outweighed the single-energy model and the clinical model.  • The nomogram also exhibited a significant prognostic ability for patient survival and enriched radiomics studies.","Jing Li,Di Dong,Jing Li,Di Dong,Mengjie Fang,Mengjie Fang,Rui Wang,Jie Tian,Rui Wang,Jie Tian,Hailiang Li,Jianbo Gao,Hailiang Li,Jianbo Gao,Jianbo Gao",European Radiology,2020.0

However, radiomic features are known to be affected by technical parameters and feature extraction methodology. We evaluate the robustness of CT radiomic features against the technical parameters involved in CT acquisition and feature extraction procedures using a standardized phantom and verify the feature robustness by using patient cases. ACR phantom was scanned with two tube currents, two reconstruction kernels, and two fields of view size. A total of 47 radiomic features of textures and first-order statistics were extracted on the homogeneous region from all scans. Intrinsic variability was measured to identify unstable features vulnerable to inherent CT noise and texture. Susceptibility index was defined to represent the susceptibility to the variation of a given technical parameter. Eighteen radiomic features were shown to be intrinsically unstable on reference condition. The features were more susceptible to the reconstruction kernel variation than to other sources of variation. The feature robustness evaluated on the phantom CT correlated with those evaluated on clinical CT scans. We revealed a number of scan parameters could significantly affect the radiomic features. These characteristics should be considered in a radiomic study when different scan parameters are used in a clinical dataset.","Haiyan Jin,Hyeongmin Jin,Jong Hyo Kim,Jong Hyo Kim,Jong Hyo Kim",Journal of Signal Processing Systems,2020.0

METHODS: 51 pathologically confirmed gliomas patients committed in our hospital from March 2015 to June 2018 were retrospective analysis, and Ki-67, vimentin, S-100 and CD34 immunohistochemical data were collected. The volumes of interest (VOIs) were manually sketched and the radiomics features were extracted. Feature reduction was performed by ANOVA+ Mann-Whiney, spearman correlation analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Gradient descent algorithm (GBDT). SMOTE technique was used to solve the data bias between two groups. Comprehensive binary logistic regression models were established. Area under the ROC curves (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were used to evaluate the predict performance of models. Models reliability were decided according to the standard net benefit of the decision curves. RESULTS: Four clusters of significant features were screened out and four predicting models were constructed. AUC of Ki-67, S-100, vimentin and CD34 models were 0.713, 0.923, 0.854 and 0.745, respectively. The sensitivities were 0.692, 0.893, 0.875 and 0.556, respectively.

In this study, for each patient 1461 radiomics features were extracted from GBM subregions (i.e., edema, necrosis, enhancement, and tumor) of mMRI (i.e., FLAIR, T1, T1C, and T2) volumes for five preprocessing combinations (in total 116880 radiomics features). The robustness and reproducibility of the radiomics features were assessed under four comparisons: (a) Baseline versus modified bias field; (b) Baseline versus modified bias field followed by noise filtering; (c) Baseline versus modified noise, and (d) Baseline versus modified noise followed bias field correction. The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), dynamic range (DR), and interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used as metrics. Shape features and subsequently, local binary pattern (LBP) filtered images were highly stable and reproducible against bias field correction and noise filtering in all measurements. In all MRI modalities, necrosis regions (NC: n ® ~449/1461, 30%) had the highest number of highly robust features, with CCC and DR >= 0.9, in comparison with edema (ED: n ® ~296/1461, 20%), enhanced (EN: n ® ~ 281/1461, 19%) and active‐tumor regions (TM: n ® ~254/1461, 17%). The necrosis regions (NC: n¯~449/1461, 30%) had a higher number of highly robust features (CCC and DR>=0.9) than edema (ED: n¯~296/1461, 20%), enhanced (EN: n¯~281/1461, 19%) and active‐tumor (TM: n¯~254/1461, 17%) regions across all modalities. Furthermore, our results identified that the percentage of high reproducible features with ICC>= 0.9 after bias field correction (23.2%), and bias field correction followed by noise filtering (22.4%) were higher in contrast with noise smoothing and also noise smoothing follow by bias correction. These preliminary findings imply that preprocessing sequences can also have a significant impact on the robustness and reproducibility of mMRI‐based radiomics features and identification of generalizable and consistent preprocessing algorithms is a pivotal step before imposing radiomics biomarkers into the clinic for GBM patients.","Hajar Moradmand,Seyed Mahmoud Reza Aghamiri,Hajar Moradmand,Reza Ghaderi,Seyed Mahmoud Reza Aghamiri,Reza Ghaderi",Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics,2020.0

At least three issues burden this approach: a) suboptimal sensitivity and suboptimal positive predictive power of radiology screening and diagnostic approaches, respectively; b) invasiveness of biopsy with discomfort for women undergoing diagnostic tests; c) long turnaround time for recall tests. In the screening setting, radiology sensitivity is suboptimal, and when a suspicious lesion is detected and a biopsy is recommended, the positive predictive value of radiology is modest. Recent technological advances in medical imaging, especially in the field of artificial intelligence applied to image analysis, hold promise in addressing clinical challenges in cancer detection, assessment of treatment response, and monitoring disease progression. Radiomics include feature extraction from clinical images; these features are related to tumor size, shape, intensity, and texture, collectively providing comprehensive tumor characterization, the so-called radiomics signature of the tumor.

According to the RECIST criteria, the therapeutic effectiveness of anticancer treatment is evaluated by unidimensional measurement of the tumor diameter. However, limitations have been observed when using this traditional response criteria alone. Multiple factors, including reader measurement variability and different technical scanning parameters, may cause errors in tumor measurement and response assessment to result in inappropriate anticancer treatment decisions. Furthermore, conventional response criteria may not accurately evaluate the latest cancer treatment options such as molecular therapy and immunotherapy. In this context, radiomics and imaging genomics may provide comprehensive information on tumor phenotypes and has shown potential for quantifying lung cancer biology and evaluating treatment response.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiomics was retrospectively done on peripheral nerve fascicles on T1-weighted 1.5T MRI of 40 patients with diagnosis of mild carpal (n = 25) and cubital tunnel (n = 15) syndrome and of 200 controls. Z-score normalization and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare features of normal and pathological peripheral nerves. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of n = 104 radiomics features were computed for each patient and control. Significant differences between normal and pathological median and ulnar nerves were found in n = 23/104 features (p < 0.001). According to features classification, n = 5/23 features were shape-based, n = 7/23 were first-order features, n = 11/23 features were classified as gray level run length matrix. Nine of the selected features showed an AUC higher that 0.7: minimum AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.61-0.89) for sum variance and maximum AUC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.82-0.99) for zone entropy. CONCLUSION: Features analysis demonstrated statistically significant differences between normal and pathological nerve. The results suggested that radiomics analysis could assess the median and ulnar nerve inner structure changes due to the loss of the fascicular pattern, intraneural edema, fibrosis or fascicular alterations in mild carpal tunnel and mild cubital tunnel syndromes even when the nerve cross-sectional area does not change.","Federica Rossi,Federica Rossi,Bianca Bignotti,Bianca Bignotti,Lorenzo Bianchi,Lorenzo Bianchi,Riccardo Picasso,Riccardo Picasso,Carlo Martinoli,Alberto Tagliafico,Carlo Martinoli,Alberto Tagliafico",Radiologia Medica,2020.0

However, conventional radiomic approaches may suffer from noise, and feature dimensionality reduction techniques are not equipped to utilize latent supervision information of patient data under study, such as differences in patients, to learn discriminative low dimensional representations. To achieve robustness to noise and feature dimensionality reduction with improved discriminative power, we develop a robust collaborative clustering method to simultaneously cluster patients and radiomic features into distinct groups respectively under adaptive sparse regularization. Our method is built upon matrix tri-factorization enhanced by adaptive sparsity regularization for simultaneous feature dimensionality reduction and denoising. Particularly, latent grouping information of patients with distinct radiomic features is learned and utilized as supervision information to guide the feature dimensionality re-duction, and noise in radiomic features is adaptively isolated in a Bayesian framework under a general assumption of Laplacian distributions of transform-domain coefficients. Experiments on synthetic data have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in data clustering, and evaluation results on an FDG-PET/CT dataset of rectal cancer patients have demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms alternative methods in terms of both patient stratification and prediction of patient clinical outcomes.","Hangfan Liu,Hongming Li,Hangfan Liu,Mohamad Habes,Hongming Li,Mohamad Habes,Yuemeng Li,Pamela J.

Nevertheless, the reproducibility and robustness of radiomics studies are hampered by the lack of standardization in feature definition and calculation. In the context of the image biomarker standardization initiative (IBSI), we investigated the grade of compliance of the image biomarker explorer (IBEX), a free open-source radiomic software, and we developed and validated standardized-IBEX (S-IBEX), an adaptation of IBEX to IBSI. METHODS: Image biomarker explorer source code was checked against IBSI standard. Both the feature implementation and the overall image preprocessing chain were evaluated. Sections were re-implemented wherever differences emerged: in particular, contour-to-binary-mask conversion, image sub-portion extraction, re-segmentation, gray-level discretization and interpolation were aligned to IBSI. All reported IBSI features were implemented in S-IBEX. On a patient phantom, S-IBEX was validated by benchmarking five different preprocessing configurations proposed by IBSI. RESULTS: Most IBEX feature definitions are IBSI compliant; however, IBEX preprocessing introduces non-negligible nonconformities, resulting in feature values not aligned with the corresponding IBSI benchmarks. On the contrary, S-IBEX features are in agreement with the standard regardless of preprocessing configurations: the percentage of features equal to their benchmark values ranges from 98.1% to 99.5%, with overall maximum percentage error below 1%. Moreover, the impact of noncompliant preprocessing steps has been assessed: in these cases, the percentage of features equal to the standard drops below 35%. CONCLUSIONS: The use of standardized software for radiomic feature extraction is essential to ensure the reproducibility of results across different institutions, easing at the same time their external validation. This work presents and validates S-IBEX, a free IBSI-compliant software, developed upon IBEX, for feature extraction that is both easy to use and quantitatively accurate.","Andrea Bettinelli,Andrea Bettinelli,M.

10.33612/diss.111448998,,,The prognostic value of CT radiomic features from primary tumours and pathological lymph nodes in head and neck cancer patients,"Head and neck cancer (HNC) is responsible for about 0.83 million new cancer cases and 0.43 million cancer deaths worldwide every year. Around 30%-50% of patients with locally advanced HNC experience treatment failures, predominantly occurring at the site of the primary tumor, followed by regional failures and distant metastases. In order to optimize treatment strategy, the overall aim of this thesis is to identify the patients who are at high risk of treatment failures. We developed and externally validated a series of models on the different patterns of failure to predict the risk of local failures, regional failures, distant metastasis and individual nodal failures in HNC patients. New type of radiomic features based on the CT image were included in our modelling analysis, and we firstly showed that the radiomic features improved the prognostic performance of the models containing clinical factors significantly. Our studies provide clinicians new tools to predict the risk of treatment failures. This may support optimization of treatment strategy of this disease, and subsequently improve the patient survival rate.","Tian‐Tian Zhai,Tian-Tian Zhai,Tiantian Zhai",,2020.0

This study aims to investigate the efficacy of 11C-methionine (MET)-PET radiomics for distinguishing recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis, as compared with conventional tumor-to-normal cortex (T/N) ratio evaluation. We enrolled 41 patients with metastatic brain tumor or glioma treated using radiation therapy who underwent MET-PET. The area with a standardized uptake value>1.3 times that of the normal brain cortex was contoured. Forty-two PET features were extracted and used in a random forest classifier and the diagnostic performance was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. Gini index was measured to identify relevant PET parameters for classification. The reference standard was surgical histopathological analysis or more than 6 months of follow-up with MRI. Forty-four lesions were used for the analysis. Thirty-three and 11 lesions were confirmed as recurrent brain tumor and radiation necrosis, respectively. Radiomics and T/N ratio evaluation showed sensitivities of 90.1% and 60.6%, and specificities of 93.9% and 72.7% with areas under the curve of 0.98 and 0.73, respectively. Gray level co-occurrence matrix dissimilarity was the most pertinent feature for diagnosis. MET-PET radiomics yielded excellent outcome for differentiating recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis, which outperformed T/N ratio evaluation.","Masatoshi Hotta,Masatoshi Hotta,Masatoshi Hotta,Ryogo Minamimoto,Koichi Miwa,Ryogo Minamimoto,Kenta Miwa",Scientific Reports,2019.0
10.1097/rlu.0000000000002810,,,A Machine-Learning Approach Using PET-Based Radiomics to Predict the Histological Subtypes of Lung Cancer.,"PURPOSE: We sought to distinguish lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) from squamous cell carcinoma using a machine-learning algorithm with PET-based radiomic features. METHODS: A total of 396 patients with 210 ADCs and 186 squamous cell carcinomas who underwent FDG PET/CT prior to treatment were retrospectively analyzed. Four clinical features (age, sex, tumor size, and smoking status) and 40 radiomic features were investigated in terms of lung ADC subtype prediction. Radiomic features were extracted from the PET images of segmented tumors using the LIFEx package. The clinical and radiomic features were ranked, and a subset of useful features was selected based on Gini coefficient scores in terms of associations with histological class. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of classifications afforded by several machine-learning algorithms (random forest, neural network, naive Bayes, logistic regression, and a support vector machine) were compared and validated via random sampling. RESULTS: We developed and validated a PET-based radiomic model predicting the histological subtypes of lung cancer. Sex, SUVmax, gray-level zone length nonuniformity, gray-level nonuniformity for zone, and total lesion glycolysis were the 5 best predictors of lung ADC. The logistic regression model outperformed all other classifiers (AUC = 0.859, accuracy = 0.769, F1 score = 0.774, precision = 0.804, recall = 0.746) followed by the neural network model (AUC = 0.854, accuracy = 0.772, F1 score = 0.777, precision = 0.807, recall = 0.750). CONCLUSIONS: A machine-learning approach successfully identified the histological subtypes of lung cancer. A PET-based radiomic features may help clinicians improve the histopathologic diagnosis in a noninvasive manner.","Seung Hyup Hyun,Seung Hyup Hyun,Mi Sun Ahn,Young Wha Koh,Mi Sun Ahn,Su Jin Lee,Sung-Gyu Lee,Young Wha Koh,Su Jin Lee,Su Jin Lee",Clinical Nuclear Medicine,2019.0

Methods:  Patients with ALK-positive III/IV NSCLC from 2014 to 2017 were enrolled retrospectively. Their pretreatment thoracic CT images were collected, and the gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined by two experienced radiation oncologists. An in-house feature extraction code-set was performed based on MATLAB 2015b (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) in patients’ CT images to extract features. Patients were randomly divided into training set and test set (4:1) by using createDataPartition function in caret package. A test-retest in RIDER NSCLC dataset was performed to identify stable radiomics features. LASSO Cox regression and a leave-one-out cross-validation were conducted to identify optimal features for the logistic regression model to evaluate the predictive value of radiomics feature(s) for BM. Furthermore, extended validation for the radiomics feature(s) and Cox regression analyses which combined radiomics feature(s) and treatment elements were implemented to predict the risk of BM during follow-up.  Results:  In total, 132 patients were included, among which 27 patients had pretreatment BM. The median follow-up time was 11.8 (range, 0.1–65.2) months. In the training set, one radiomics feature (W_GLCM_ LH_Correlation) showed discrimination ability of BM (P value =0.014, AUC =0.687, 95% CI: 0.551–0.824, specificity =83.5%, sensitivity =57.1%). It also exhibited reposeful performance in the test set (AUC =0.642, 95% CI: 0.501–0.783, specificity =60.0%, sensitivity =83.3%). Those 105 patients without pretreatment BM were divided into stage III (n=57) and stage IV (n=48) groups. The radiomics feature (W_GLCM_LH_ Correlation) had moderate performance to predict BM during/after treatment in separate groups (stage III: AUC =0.682, 95% CI: 0.537–0.826, specificity =64.4%, sensitivity =75.0%; stage IV: AUC =0.653, 95% CI: 0.503–0.804, specificity =70.4%, sensitivity =75.0%). Meanwhile, stage III patients could be divided into low risk and high risk groups for BM during surveillance according to Cox regression analysis (log-rank P value =0.021).  Conclusions:  We identified one wavelet texture feature derived from pretreatment thoracic CT that presented potential in predicting BM in stage III/IV ALK-positive NSCLC patients. This could be beneficial to risk stratification for such patients. Further investigation is necessary to include expanded sample size investigation and external multicenter validation.","Xinyan Xu,Lv Huang,X.

10.1038/s41598-019-51599-7,31645603.0,,Combined CT radiomics of primary tumor and metastatic lymph nodes improves prediction of loco-regional control in head and neck cancer.,"Loco-regional control (LRC) is a major clinical endpoint after definitive radiochemotherapy (RCT) of head and neck cancer (HNC). Radiomics has been shown a promising biomarker in cancer research, however closer related to primary tumor control than composite endpoints. Radiomics studies often focus on the analysis of primary tumor (PT). We hypothesize that the combination of PT and lymph nodes (LN) radiomics better predicts LRC in HNC treated with RCT. Radiomics analysis was performed in CT images of 128 patients using Z-Rad implementation (training n=77, validation n=51). 285 features were extracted from PT and involved LN. Features were preselected with the maximum relevance minimum redundancy method and the multivariate Cox model was trained using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The mixed model was based on the combination of PT and LN radiomics, whereas the PT model included only the PT features. The mixed model showed significantly higher performance than the PT model (p<0.01), c-index of 0.67 and 0.63, respectively; and better risk group stratification. The clinical nodal status was not a significant predictor in the combination with PT radiomics. This study shows that the LRC can be better predicted by expansion of radiomics analysis with LN features.","Marta Bogowicz,Marta Bogowicz,Stephanie Tanadini‐Lang,Matthias Gückenberger,Stephanie Tanadini-Lang,Oliver Riesterer,Matthias Guckenberger,Oliver Riesterer",Scientific Reports,2019.0

The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of machine learning- (ML-) based quantitative texture analysis in the differentiation of benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Materials and methods. A sum of 306 quantitative textural features of 235 thyroid nodules (102 malignant, 43.4%; 133 benign, 56.4%) of a total of 198 patients were investigated using the random forest ML classifier. Feature selection and dimension reduction were conducted using reproducibility testing and a wrapper method. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve (AUC) of the proposed method were compared with the histopathological or cytopathological findings as reference methods. Results. Of the 306 initial texture features, 284 (92.2%) showed good reproducibility (intraclass correlation ≥0.80). The random forest classifier accurately identified 87 out of 102 malignant thyroid nodules and 117 out of 133 benign thyroid nodules, which is a diagnostic sensitivity of 85.2%, specificity of 87.9%, and accuracy of 86.8%. The AUC of the model was 0.92. Conclusions. Quantitative textural analysis of thyroid nodules using ML classification can accurately discriminate benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Our findings should be validated by multicenter prospective studies using completely independent external data.","Bülent Çolakoğlu,Bulent Colakoglu,Deniz Aliş,Deniz Alis,Mert Yergin,Mert Yergin",Journal of Oncology,2019.0
10.1038/s41597-019-0241-0,31641134.0,,Distributed radiomics as a signature validation study using the Personal Health Train infrastructure.,"Prediction modelling with radiomics is a rapidly developing research topic that requires access to vast amounts of imaging data. Methods that work on decentralized data are urgently needed, because of concerns about patient privacy. Previously published computed tomography medical image sets with gross tumour volume (GTV) outlines for non-small cell lung cancer have been updated with extended follow-up. In a previous study, these were referred to as Lung1 (n=421) and Lung2 (n=221). The Lung1 dataset is made publicly accessible via The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA; https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net). We performed a decentralized multi-centre study to develop a radiomic signature (hereafter “ZS2019”) in one institution and validated the performance in an independent institution, without the need for data exchange and compared this to an analysis where all data was centralized. The performance of ZS2019 for 2-year overall survival validated in distributed radiomics was not statistically different from the centralized validation (AUC 0.61 vs 0.61; p=0.52). Although slightly different in terms of data and methods, no statistically significant difference in performance was observed between the new signature and previous work (c-index 0.58 vs 0.65; p=0.37). Our objective was not the development of a new signature with the best performance, but to suggest an approach for distributed radiomics. Therefore, we used a similar method as an earlier study. We foresee that the Lung1 dataset can be further re-used for testing radiomic models and investigating feature reproducibility.","Zhenwei Shi,Zhenwei Shi,Ivan Zhovannik,Alberto Traverso,I.

The aim of this study is to systematically review the current literature and reflect on its quality.    Methods  PubMed and EMBASE databases were systematically searched for studies investigating MRI-based radiomics for tumor response prediction. Abstracts were screened by two reviewers independently. The quality of the radiomics workflow of eligible studies was assessed using the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS). An overview of the methodologies used in steps of the radiomics workflow and current results are presented.    Results  Sixteen studies were included with cohort sizes ranging from 35 to 414 patients. The RQS scores varied from 0 % to 41.2 %. Methodologies in the radiomics workflow varied greatly, especially region of interest segmentation, features selection, and model development with heterogeneous outcomes as a result. Seven studies applied univariate analysis and nine studies applied multivariate analysis. Most studies performed their analysis on the pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequence. Entropy was the best performing individual feature with AUC values ranging from 0.83 to 0.85. The best performing multivariate prediction model, based on logistic regression analysis, scored a validation AUC of 0.94.    Conclusion  This systematic review revealed large methodological heterogeneity for each step of the MRI-based radiomics workflow, consequently, the (overall promising) results are difficult to compare.

Data from 160 pathologically confirmed glioma patients were analyzed. The diagnostic model was developed in a primary cohort (n = 112). Textural features were extracted from postoperative 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), 11C-methionine (11C-MET) PET, and magnetic resonance images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model was used for feature selection and radiomics signature building. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to develop a model for predicting tumor recurrence. The radiomics signature, quantitative PET parameters, and clinical risk factors were incorporated in the model. The clinical value of the model was then assessed in an independent validation cohort using the remaining 48 glioma patients. The integrated model consisting of 15 selected features was significantly associated with postoperative tumor recurrence (p < 0.001 for both primary and validation cohorts). Predictors contained in the individualized diagnosis model included the radiomics signature, the mean of tumor-background ratio (TBR) of 18F-FDG, maximum of TBR of 11C-MET PET, and patient age. The integrated model demonstrated good discrimination, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.988, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.975–1.000. Application in the validation cohort showed good differentiation (AUC of 0.914 and 95% CI of 0.881–0.945). Decision curve analysis showed that the integrated diagnosis model was clinically useful.

Previously, the application of multimodality imaging in oncology has been mainly related to combining anatomical and functional imaging to improve diagnostic specificity and/or target definition, such as positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and single-photon emission CT (SPECT)/CT. More recently, the fusion of various images, such as multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences, different PET tracer images, PET/MRI, has become more prevalent, which has enabled more comprehensive characterization of the tumor phenotype. In order to take advantage of these valuable multimodal data for clinical decision making using radiomics, we present two ways to implement the multimodal image analysis, namely radiomic (handcrafted feature) based and deep learning (machine learned feature) based methods. Applying advanced machine (deep) learning algorithms across multimodality images have shown better results compared with single modality modeling for prognostic and/or prediction of clinical outcomes. This holds great potentials for providing more personalized treatment for patients and achieve better outcomes.","Lin-Hung Wei,Lise Wei,Sarah Osman,Sarah O.S.

A T category prediction radiomics (TCPR) model would be helpful for subsequent surgery. A total of 211 patients with locally advanced laryngeal cancer who had undergone total laryngectomy were randomly classified into the training cohort (n = 150) and the validation cohort (n = 61). We extracted 1390 radiomic features from the contrast-enhanced computed tomography images. Interclass correlation coefficient and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses were performed to select features associated with pathology-confirmed T category. Eight radiomic features were found associated with preoperative T category. The radiomic signature was constructed by Support Vector Machine algorithm with the radiomic features. We developed a nomogram incorporating radiomic signature and T category reported by experienced radiologists. The performance of the model was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC). The T category reported by radiologists achieved an AUC of 0.775 (95% CI: 0.667-0.883); while the radiomic signature yielded a significantly higher AUC of 0.862 (95% CI: 0.772-0.952). The predictive performance of the nomogram incorporating radiomic signature and T category reported by radiologists further improved, with an AUC of 0.892 (95% CI: 0.811-0.974). Consequently, for locally advanced laryngeal cancer, the TCPR model incorporating radiomic signature and T category reported by experienced radiologists have great potential to be applied for individual accurate preoperative T category. The TCPR model may benefit decision-making regarding total laryngectomy or larynx-preserving treatment.","Fei Wang,Bin Zhang,Fei Wang,Bin Zhang,Bin Zhang,Xiangjun Wu,Bin Zhang,Lizhi Liu,Li Zhi Liu,Xiangjun Wu,Fang Jin,Lizhi Liu,Lizhi Liu,Lizhi Liu,Jin Fang,Fang Jin,Jin Fang,Jin Fang,Justin Chen,Qiuying Chen,Minmin Li,Zhuozhi Chen,Minmin Li,Yueyue Li,Zhuozhi Chen,Yueyue Li,Di Dong,Di Dong,Jie Tian,Jie Tian,Shuixing Zhang,Shuixing Zhang",Frontiers in Oncology,2019.0

The retrospective study included 188 patients based on MRI with histologically confirmed rectal cancer and evaluated LVI status. Clinical factors and image data were collected, and radiomics features were extracted from multi-region (tumor and mesorectum) and single region (tumor), respectively, on T2WI and DWI. Spearman correlation analysis and the LASSO algorithm were used for radiomic feature extraction and selection; preliminarily selection of an optimal classifier by the results of the fivefold cross-validation performance in the six preselected specific machine learning classifier. Multi-regional and single-regional predictive models were both built and evaluated by calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and corresponding accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, etc. A Ridge Classification model was constructed with 21 features (2 clinical features, 10 radiomics features from mesorectum region, and 9 radiomics features from tumor region) selected by Spearman correlation and LASSO analysis. The multi-regional model shows a good performance in the differentiation of the status of LVI in training data sets (AUC=0.87, accuracy=0.79). The model was further validated in the testing data sets, giving an AUC and an accuracy of 0.74 and 0.68, respectively. Furthermore, the performance of single-regional model (AUC=0.72, accuracy=0.67) is lower compared to the values given by the multi-regional model.

Materials and methods  In this retrospective study, radiomic analysis was performed using preoperative axial T1 FLAIR, T2-weighted, and enhanced T1 FLAIR from a single hospital. The primary clinical endpoint was progression-free survival. A total of 1860 3-D radiomic features were extracted from manually segmented region of interest. Pearson correlation coefficient was used for feature dimensional reduction and a ridge regression-based Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine a radiomic signature. Afterwards, radiomic signature and nine other potential prognostic factors, including age, gender, histological subtype, dural invasion, blood supply, adjuvant radiotherapy, extent of resection, preoperative KPS, and postoperative KPS were analyzed to build a radiomic nomogram and a clinical model. Finally, we compared the nomogram with each prognostic factor/model by DeLong’s test.    Results  A total of 148 SBC patients were enrolled, including 64 with disease progression. The median follow-up time was 52months (range 4–122months). The Harrell’s concordance index of the radiomic signature was 0.745 (95% CI, 0.709–0.781) for the validation cohort, and its discrimination accuracy in predicting progression risk at 5years in the same cohort was 82.4% (95% CI, 72.6–89.7%).    Conclusions  The radiomics is a low-cost, non-invasive method to predict SBC prognosis preoperatively. Radiomic signature is a potential prognostic biomarker that may allow the individualized evaluation of patients with SBC.","Wei Wei,Wei Wei,Wei Wei,Wei Wei,Ke Wang,Zhenyu Liu,Ke Wang,Zhenyu Liu,Zhenyu Liu,Kaibing Tian,Kaibing Tian,Liang Wang,Jiang Du,Liang Wang,Liang Wang,Jiang Du,Junpeng Ma,Jiang Du,Jiang Du,Shuo Wang,Junpeng Ma,Longfei Li,Shuo Wang,Shuo Wang,Shuo Wang,Longfei Li,Rui Zhao,Rui Zhao,Cheng Luo,Luo Cui,Zhen Wu,Jie Tian,Zhen Wu,Jie Tian",Radiotherapy and Oncology,2019.0
10.3390/cancers11111680,31671766.0,,Radiomics Model Based on Non-Contrast CT Shows No Predictive Power for Complete Pathological Response in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer,"(1) Background: About 15% of the patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation for locally advanced rectal cancer exhibit pathological complete response (pCR). The surgical approach is associated with major risks as well as a potential negative impact on quality of life and has been questioned in the past. Still, there is no evidence of a reliable clinical or radiological surrogate marker for pCR. This study aims to replicate previously reported response predictions on the basis of non-contrast CT scans on an independent patient cohort. (2) Methods: A total of 169 consecutive patients (126 males, 43 females) that underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation and consecutive total mesorectal excision were included. The solid tumors were segmented on CT scans acquired on the same scanner for treatment planning. To quantify intratumoral 3D spatial heterogeneity, 1819 radiomics parameters were derived per case. Feature selection and algorithmic modeling were performed to classify pCR vs. non-pCR cases. A random forest model was trained on the dataset using 4-fold cross-validation. (3) Results: The model achieved an accuracy of 87%, higher than previously reported. Correction for the imbalanced distribution of pCR and non-PCR cases (13% and 87% respectively) was applied, yielding a balanced accuracy score of 0.5%. An additional experiment to classify a computer-generated random data sample using the same model led to comparable results. (4) Conclusions: There is no evidence of added value of a radiomics model based on on-contrast CT scans for prediction of pCR in rectal cancer. The imbalance of the target variable could be identified as a key issue, leading to a biased model and optimistic predictions.","Gordian Hamerla,Gordian Hamerla,Hans‐Jonas Meyer,Hans-Jonas Meyer,Hans-Jonas Meyer,Peter Hambsch,U.

10.3389/fonc.2019.01330,31850216.0,,T2-Weighted Image-Based Radiomics Signature for Discriminating Between Seminomas and Nonseminoma.,"Objective: To evaluate the performance of a T2-weighted image (T2WI)-based radiomics signature for differentiating between seminomas and nonseminomas. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 39 patients with testicular germ-cell tumors (TGCTs) confirmed by radical orchiectomy were enrolled, including 19 cases of seminomas and 20 cases of nonseminomas. All patients underwent 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before radical orchiectomy. Eight hundred fifty-one radiomics features were extracted from the T2WI of each patient. Intra- and interclass correlation coefficients were used to select the features with excellent stability and repeatability. Then, we used the minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance (mRMR) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithms for feature selection and radiomics signature development. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the radiomics signature. Results: Five features were selected to build the radiomics signature. The radiomics signature was significantly different between the seminomas and nonseminomas (p < 0.01). The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of the radiomics signature for discriminating between seminomas and nonseminomas were 0.979 (95% CI: 0.873–1.000), 90.00 (95% CI: 68.3–98.8), and 100.00 (95% CI: 82.4–100.0), respectively.

10.3389/fonc.2019.01021,31681572.0,,The Utility of Texture Analysis Based on Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Differentiating Phyllodes Tumors From Fibroadenomas,"Background: The preoperative diagnosis of phyllodes tumors (PTs) of the breast is critical to appropriate surgical treatment. However, reliable differentiation between PT and fibroadenoma (FA) remains difficult in daily clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of breast MRI texture analysis for differentiating PTs from FAs. Materials and Methods: Forty-two PTs and 42 FAs were enrolled in this retrospective study. Clinical and conventional MRI features (CCMF) and MRI texture analysis were used to distinguish between PT and FA. Texture features were extracted from the axial short TI inversion recovery T2-weighted (T2W-STIR), T1-weighted pre-contrast, and two contrast-enhanced series (first contrast and third contrast). The Mann–Whitney U test was used to select statistically significant features of texture analysis and CCMF. Using a linear discriminant analysis, the most discriminative features were determined from statistically significant features. The K-nearest neighbor classifier and ROC curve were applied to evaluate the diagnostic performance. Results: With a higher classification accuracy (89.3%) and an AUC of 0.89, the texture features on T2W-STIR outperformed the texture features on other MRI sequences and CCMF. The AUC of the combination of CCMF with texture features on T2W-STIR was significantly higher than that of CCMF or texture features on T2W-STIR alone (p < 0.05). Based on the result of the classification accuracy (95.2%) and AUC (0.95), the diagnostic performance of the combination strategy performed better than texture features on T2W-STIR or CCMF separately. Conclusions: Texture features on T2W-STIR showed better diagnostic performance compared to CCMF for the distinction between PTs and FAs. After further validation of multi-institutional large datasets, MRI-based texture features may become a potential biomarker and be a useful medical decision tool in clinical trials having patients with breast fibroepithelial neoplasms.","Hui Mai,Yifei Mao,Hui Mai,Tianfa Dong,Yifei Mao,Yu Ting Tan,Tianfa Dong,Xiaowei Huang,Yu Tan,Xiaowei Huang,Songxin Wu,Songxin Wu,Shuting Huang,Shuting Huang,Xi Zhong,Xi Zhong,Yingwei Qiu,Lixia Luo,Yingwei Qiu,Kuiming Jiang,Liangping Luo,Kuiming Jiang",Frontiers in Oncology,2019.0
10.21037/atm.2019.11.26,32042789.0,,Use of radiomic features and support vector machine to distinguish Parkinson's disease cases from normal controls.,"Background:  Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease. The diagnosis of PD based on neuroimaging is usually with low-level or deep learning features, which results in difficulties in achieving precision classification or interpreting the clinical significance. Herein, we aimed to extract high- order features by using radiomics approach and achieve acceptable diagnosis accuracy in PD. Methods:  In this retrospective multicohort study, we collected 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) images and clinical scale [the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn & Yahr scale (H&Y)] from two cohorts. One cohort from Huashan Hospital had 91 normal controls (NC) and 91 PD patients (UPDRS: 22.7±11.7, H&Y: 1.8±0.8), and the other cohort from Wuxi 904 Hospital had 26 NC and 22 PD patients (UPDRS: 20.9±11.6, H&Y: 1.7±0.9). The Huashan cohort was used as the training and test sets by 5-fold cross-validation and the Wuxi cohort was used as another separate test set. After identifying regions of interests (ROIs) based on the atlas-based method, radiomic features were extracted and selected by using autocorrelation and fisher score algorithm. A support vector machine (SVM) was trained to classify PD and NC based on selected radiomic features. In the comparative experiment, we compared our method with the traditional voxel values method. To guarantee the robustness, above processes were repeated in 500 times. Results:  Twenty-six brain ROIs were identified. Six thousand one hundred and ten radiomic features were extracted in total. Among them 30 features were remained after feature selection. The accuracies of the proposed method achieved 90.97%±4.66% and 88.08%±5.27% in Huashan and Wuxi test sets, respectively.

METHODS: A total of 191 patients with high-grade osteosarcoma (HOS) were enrolled retrospectively from November 2013 to November 2017 and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT). A cutoff time of November 2016 was used to divide the training set and validation set. All patients underwent diagnostic CTs before and after chemotherapy. By quantifying the tumor regions on the CT images before and after NCT, 540 delta-radiomic features were calculated. The interclass correlation coefficients for segmentations of inter/intra-observers and feature pair-wise correlation coefficients (Pearson) were used for robust feature selection. A delta-radiomics signature was constructed using the lasso algorithm based on the training set. Radiomics signatures built from single-phase CT were constructed for comparison purpose. A radiomics nomogram was then developed from the multivariate logistic regression model by combining independent clinical factors and the delta-radiomics signature. The prediction performance was assessed using area under the ROC curve (AUC), calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: The delta-radiomics signature showed higher AUC than single-CT based radiomics signatures in both training and validation cohorts. The delta-radiomics signature, consisting of 8 selected features, showed significant differences between the pathologic good response (pGR) (necrosis fraction >/=90%) group and the non-pGR (necrosis fraction < 90%) group (P < 0.0001, in both training and validation sets). The delta-radiomics nomogram, which consisted of the delta-radiomics signature and new pulmonary metastasis during chemotherapy showed good calibration and great discrimination capacity with AUC 0.871 (95% CI, 0.804 to 0.923) in the training cohort, and 0.843 (95% CI, 0.718 to 0.927) in the validation cohort. The DCA confirmed the clinical utility of the radiomics model. CONCLUSION: The delta-radiomics nomogram incorporating the radiomics signature and clinical factors in this study could be used for individualized pathologic response evaluation after chemotherapy preoperatively and help tailor appropriate chemotherapy and further treatment plans.","Peng Lin,Peng Lin,Pengfei Yang,Pengfei Yang,Shi Chen,Youyou Shao,Shi Chen,Lei Xu,You-You Shao,You-You Shao,Lei Xu,Lei Xu,Lei Xu,Yan Wu,Yan Wu,Wangsiyuan Teng,Yan Wu,Wangsiyuan Teng,Xingzhi Zhou,Xingzhi Zhou,Binghao Li,Chen Luo,Binghao Li,Chen Luo,Lanfang Xu,Mingyan Huang,Lei-Ming Xu,Tianye Niu,Mi Huang,Tianye Niu,Zhaoming Ye,Zhaoming Ye,Zhaoming Ye",Cancer Imaging,2020.0

METHODS: We evaluated 553 original articles concerning radiomics, published in a total of 61 peer-reviewed journals between 2013 and 2018. The following information was retrieved for each article: radiological subspecialty, imaging technique(s), machine learning technique(s), sample size, study setting and design, statistical result(s), study purpose, software used for feature calculation, funding declarations, author number, first author's affiliation, study origin, and journal name. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed for the manually extracted data for identification and visualization of the trends in radiomics research. RESULTS: The annual growth rate in the number of published papers was 177.82% (p < 0.001). The characteristics and trends of research hotspots in the field of radiomics were clarified and visualized in this study. It was found that the field of radiomics is at a more mature stage for lung, breast, and prostate cancers than for other sites. Radiomics studies primarily focused on radiological characterization (215) and monitoring (182). Logistic regression and LASSO were the two most commonly used techniques for feature selection. Non-clinical researchers without a medical background dominated radiomics studies (70.52%), the vast majority of which only highlighted positive results (97.80%) while downplaying negative findings.

METHODS: Pubmed and Embase were searched up the terms radiomics or radiogenomics and gliomas or glioblastomas until February 2019. From 189 articles, 51 original research articles reporting the diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive utility were selected. The quality of the methodology was evaluated according to the RQS. The adherence rates for the six key domains were evaluated: image protocol and reproducibility, feature reduction and validation, biologic/clinical utility, performance index, a high level of evidence, and open science. Subgroup analyses for journal type (imaging vs. clinical) and biomarker (diagnostic vs. prognostic/predictive) were performed. RESULTS: The median RQS was 11 out of 36 and adherence rate was 37.1%. Only 29.4% performed external validation. The adherence rate was high for reporting imaging protocol (100%), feature reduction (94.1%), and discrimination statistics (96.1%), but low for conducting test-retest analysis (2%), prospective study (3.9%), demonstrating potential clinical utility (2%), and open science (5.9%).

Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the traditional imaging method for the evaluation of brain metastases, as it provides information about lesion size, morphology, and macroscopic properties. Newer MRI sequences have been developed to increase the conspicuity of detecting enhancing metastases. Other advanced MRI techniques, that have the capability to probe beyond the anatomic structure, are available to characterize micro-structures, cellularity, physiology, perfusion, and metabolism. Artificial intelligence provides powerful computational tools for detection, segmentation, classification, prediction, and prognosis.

Non-invasive imaging is the pillar of modern cardiovascular diagnostics, with modalities such as cardiac computed tomography (CT) now recognized as first-line options for cardiovascular risk stratification and the assessment of stable or even unstable patients. To date, cardiovascular imaging has lagged behind other fields, such as oncology, in the clinical translational of artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches. We hereby review the current status of AI in non-invasive cardiovascular imaging, using cardiac CT as a running example of how novel machine learning (ML)-based radiomic approaches can improve clinical care. The integration of ML, deep learning, and radiomic methods has revealed direct links between tissue imaging phenotyping and tissue biology, with important clinical implications. More specifically, we discuss the current evidence, strengths, limitations, and future directions for AI in cardiac imaging and CT, as well as lessons that can be learned from other areas. Finally, we propose a scientific framework in order to ensure the clinical and scientific validity of future studies in this novel, yet highly promising field.

10.3389/fonc.2020.00412,,,Correlation Between Mammographic Radiomics Features and the Level of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Patients With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.,"Objectives: Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been identified as a significant prognostic indicator of response to neoadjuvant therapy and immunotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Herein, we aim to assess the association between TIL levels and mammographic features in TNBC patients. Methods: Forty-three patients with surgically proven TNBC who underwent preoperative mammography from January 2018 to December 2018 were recruited. Pyradiomics software was used to extract 204 quantitative radiomics features, including morphologic, grayscale, and textural features, from the segmented lesion areas. The correlation between radiological characteristics and TIL levels was evaluated by screening the most statistically significant radiological features using Mann-Whitney U-test and Pearson correlation coefficient. The patients were divided into two groups based on tumor TIL levels: patients with TIL levels  /=50%. The correlation between TIL levels and clinicopathological characteristics was assessed using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Mann-Whitney U-test and Pearson correlation coefficient were used to analyze the statistical significance and Pearson correlation coefficient of clinical pathological features, age, and radiological features. Results: Of 43 patients, 32 (74.4%) had low TIL levels and 11 (25.6%) had high TIL levels. The histological grade of the low TIL group was higher than that of the high TIL group (p = 0.043). The high TIL group had a more negative threshold Ki-67 level (<14%) than the low TIL group (p = 0.017). The six most important radiomics features [uniformity, variance, grayscale symbiosis matrix (GLCM) correlation, GLCM autocorrelation, gray level difference matrix (GLDM) low gray level emphasis, and neighborhood gray-tone difference matrix (NGTDM) contrast], representing qualitative mammographic image characteristics, were statistically different (p < 0.05) among the low and high TIL groups. Tumors in the high TIL group had a more non-uniform density and a smoother gradient of the tumor pattern than the low TIL group. The changes in Ki-67, age, epidermal growth factor receptor, radiomic characteristics, and Pearson correlation coefficient were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Mammography features not only distinguish high and low TIL levels in TNBC patients but also can act as imaging biomarkers to enhance diagnosis and the response of patients to neoadjuvant therapies and immunotherapies.","Hongwei Yu,Xianqi Meng,Hongwei Yu,Xianqi Meng,Chen Huang,Huang Chen,Xiaoxu Han,Xiaowei Han,Xiaowei Han,Xiaowei Han,Jingfan Fan,Jingfan Fan,Jingfan Fan,Wenwen Gao,Jingfan Fan,Wenwen Gao,Lei Du,Lei Du,Lei Du,Yue Chen,Lei Du,Yige Wang,Yue Chen,Xiuxiu Liu,Yige Wang,Lu Zhang,Xiuxiu Liu,Guolin Ma,Lu Zhang,Lu Zhang,Jian Yang,Guolin Ma,Jian Yang",Frontiers in Oncology,2020.0

This retrospective study included 108 patients who had pathologically confirmed brain gliomas and DTI scanned during 2012–2018. This cohort included 43 low-grade gliomas (LGGs; all grade II) and 65 high-grade gliomas (HGGs; grade III or IV). We extracted a set of radiomic features, including traditional texture, morphological, and novel deep features derived from pre-trained convolutional neural network models, in the manually-delineated tumor regions. We employed support vector machine and these radiomic features for two classification tasks: LGGs vs HGGs, and grade III vs IV. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity was reported as the performance metrics using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. When combining FA+MD, AUC=0.93, accuracy=0.94, sensitivity=0.98, and specificity=0.86 in classifying LGGs from HGGs, while AUC=0.99, accuracy=0.98, sensitivity=0.98, and specificity=1.00 in classifying grade III from IV. The AUC and accuracy remain close when features were extracted from only the solid tumor or additionally including necrosis, cyst, and peritumoral edema. Still, the effects in terms of sensitivity and specificity are mixed. Deep radiomic features derived from pre-trained convolutional neural networks showed higher prediction ability than the traditional texture and shape features in both classification experiments.

Rectal cancer (RC) accounts for about 28% of all newly diagnosed CRC cases. The treatment of choice for locally advanced RC is a combination of surgical resection and chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. These patients can potentially be cured, but the clinical outcome depends on the tumor biology. Microsatellite instability (MSI) is an important biomarker in CRC, with crucial diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive implications. It is important to develop a noninvasive, repeatable, and reproducible method to reflect the microsatellite status. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been recommended as the preferred imaging examination for RC in clinical practice by both the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines. T2WI is the core sequence of MRI scanning protocol for RC. Radiomics, the high-throughput mining of quantitative image features from standard-of-care medical imaging that enables data to be extracted and applied within clinical-decision support systems to improve diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive accuracy, is gaining importance in cancer research.We proposed a hypothesis: A simple radiomics model based on only T2WI images can accurately evaluate the MSI status of RC preoperatively. OBJECTIVE: To develop a radiomics model based on T2WI images for accurate preoperative diagnosis the MSI status of RC. METHOD: All patients with RC were retrospectively enrolled. The dataset was randomly split into training cohort (70% of all patients) and testing cohort (30% of all patients). The radiomics features will be extracted from T2WI-MR images of the entire primary tumor region. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to select the most predictive radiomics features. Logistic regression models were constructed in the training/validation cohort to discriminate the MSI status using clinical factors, radiomics features, or their integration. The diagnostic performance of these 3 models was evaluated in the testing cohort based on their area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. DISCUSSION: This study will help us know whether radiomics model based on T2WI images to preoperative identify MSI status of RC.","Zixing Huang,Wei Zhang,Zixing Huang,Wei Zhang,Du He,Wei Zhang,Wei Zhang,Wei Zhang,Wei Zhang,Xing Chen,Du He,Tian Song,Xing Cui,Hongkun Yin,Song Tian,Hongkun Yin,Bin Song,Bin Song",Medicine,2020.0

METHODS: Eighty-six NSCLC patients were enrolled in this study, and we selected 231 mediastinal LNs confirmed by pathology results as the subjects which were divided into training (n = 163) and validation cohorts (n = 68). The regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated on CT scans in the plain phase, arterial phase and venous phase, respectively. Radiomic features were extracted from the CT images in each phase. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was used to select features, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to build models. We constructed six models (orders 1-6) based on the radiomic features of the single- and dual-phase CT images. The performance of the radiomic model was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). RESULTS: A total of 846 features were extracted from each ROI, and 10, 9, 5, 2, 2, and 9 features were chosen to develop models 1-6, respectively. All of the models showed excellent discrimination, with AUCs greater than 0.8. The plain CT radiomic model, model 1, yielded the highest AUC, specificity, accuracy and PPV, which were 0.926 and 0.925; 0.860 and 0.769; 0.871 and 0.882; and 0.906 and 0.870 in the training and validation sets, respectively. When the plain and venous phase CT radiomic features were combined with the arterial phase CT images, the sensitivity increased from 0.879 and 0.919 to 0.949 and 0979 and the NPV increased from 0.821 and 0.789 to 0.878 and 0.900 in the training group, respectively.

The goal of our study was to use various radiomics software packages to classify patients with radiation pneumonitis (RP) and to quantify the variation in classification ability among packages. Approach: A database of serial thoracic computed tomography scans was obtained from 105 patients with esophageal cancer. Patients were treated with radiation therapy (RT), resulting in 20 patients developing RP grade >/= 2 . Regions of interest (ROIs) were randomly placed in the lung volume of the pre-RT scan within high-dose regions ( >/= 30 Gy ), and corresponding ROIs were anatomically matched in the post-RT scan. Three radiomics packages were compared: A1 (in-house), IBEX v1.0 beta, and PyRadiomics v.2.0.0. Radiomics features robust to deformable registration and common among radiomics packages were calculated: four first-order and four gray-level co-occurrence matrix features. Differences in feature values between time points were calculated for each feature, and logistic regression was used in conjunction with analysis of variance to classify patients with and without RP ( p   0.5 .

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of utilizing the multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics and clinical features in classifying NSCLC. This retrospective study involved 148 eligible patients with postoperative pathologically confirmed NSCLC. The study was conducted in three steps: (1) feature extraction was performed using the online freely available package with the multimodal MRI data; (2) feature selection was performed using the Student's t test and support vector machine (SVM)-based recursive feature elimination method with the training cohort (n = 100), and the performance of these selected features was evaluated using both the training and the validation cohorts (n = 48) with a non-linear SVM classifier; (3) a Radscore model was then generated using logistic regression algorithm; (4) Integrating the Radscore with the semantic clinical features, a radiomics-clinical nomogram was developed, and its overall performance was evaluated with both cohorts. RESULTS: Thirteen optimal features achieved favorable discrimination performance with both cohorts, with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.819 and 0.824, respectively. The radiomics-clinical nomogram integrating the Radscore with the independent clinical predictors exhibited more favorable discriminative power, with AUC improved to 0.901 and 0.872 in both cohorts, respectively. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test and decision curve analysis results furtherly showed good predictive precision and clinical usefulness of the nomogram.

This retrospective study involved 106 eligible patients from two independent clinical centers. All patients underwent a preoperative 3.0T MRI scan with T2-weighted image (T2WI) and multi-b-value diffusion-weighted image (DWI) sequences. In total, 1404 radiomics features were extracted from the largest region of the reported tumor locations on the T2WI, DWI, and corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC) of each patient. A radiomics signature, namely the Radscore, was then generated using the recursive feature elimination approach and a logistic regression algorithm in a training cohort (n=64). Its performance was then validated in an independent validation cohort (n=42). The primary imaging and clinical factors in conjunction with the Radscore were used to determine whether the performance could be further improved. The Radscore, generated by 36 selected radiomics features, demonstrated a favorable ability to predict muscle-invasive BCa status in both the training (AUC 0.880) and validation (AUC 0.813) cohorts. Subsequently, integrating the two independent predictors (including the Radscore and MRI-determined tumor stalk) into a nomogram exhibited more favorable discriminatory performance, with the AUC improved to 0.924 and 0.877 in both cohorts, respectively. The proposed multisequence MRI-based radiomics signature alone could be an effective tool for quantitative prediction of muscle-invasive status of BCa. Integrating the Radscore with MRI-determined tumor stalk could further improve the discriminatory power, realizing more accurate prediction of nonmuscle-invasive and muscle-invasive BCa. • DWI is superior to T2WI sequence in reflecting the heterogeneous differences between NMIBC and MIBC, and multisequence MRI helps in the preoperative prediction of muscle-invasive status of BCa.                   • Co-occurrence (CM), run-length matrix (RLM), and gray-level size zone matrix (GLSZM) features were the favorable feature categories for the prediction of muscle-invasive status of BCa. • The Radscore (proposed multisequence MRI-based radiomics signature) helps predict preoperatively muscle invasion.

After CT volumetric density measurement of primary gross tumour volume (GTV), aorta and tracheal air, density correction was conducted on GTV (reference values: aortic blood and tracheal air). For each resulting data set (combining CM administration and normalization), first-order statistical and textural features were extracted. CP and imaging data were correlated with patients 1-, 3- and 5-year OS, alone and combined (uni-/multivariate logistic regression and Akaike information criterion). Predictive performance was evaluated using the ROC curves and AUC values and compared among non-normalized/normalized data sets (DeLong test). The best predictive values were obtained when combining CP and imaging parameters (AUC values: 1year 0.72; 3years 0.82; 5years 0.78).

However, highly predictive biomarkers of immunotherapy response are unmet clinical need. In this study, we utilized pre-treatment clinical factors and quantitative image-based biomarkers (radiomics) to identify a parsimonious model that predicts survival outcomes among NSCLC patients treated with immunotherapy. The NSCLC patients treated with single or double agent immunotherapy were included in three different cohorts: Training (N = 180), test (N = 90) and validation (N = 62) cohorts. The models were created based on overall survival (OS) and were additionally assessed for progression-free survival (PFS). Including most predictive radiomic features and clinical covariates, Classification and Regression Tree analysis was applied to stratify patients into survival risk-groups in the training cohort. The risk groups were later generated in the test and validation cohorts. Four independent NSCLC cohorts (total N = 446) were utilized for further validation of the radiomic signature. The biological underpinnings of the most informative radiomics were assessed using gene expression data from a radiogenomics dataset and validated by immunohistochemistry data (IHC). A parsimonious clinical-radiomics model was found to be significantly associated with OS and PFS after stratifying patients into groups of low-, moderate- , high- , and very-high risk of death and progression. This trained model was further tested and validated in two independent cohorts.  When the extreme phenotypes were compared, the very-high risk group was found to be associated with extremely poor OS in both the test (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.14 - 13.36; 1-year OS = 11.1%) and validation (HR = 13.81, 95% CI: 2.58 - 73.93; 1-year OS = %47.6) cohorts when compared to the low risk group (HRs = 1.00; 1-year OS = 85.0% & 80.2%). Similar findings were observed for PFS. The final radiomic feature (GLCM inverse difference) was associated with OS in four independent NSCLC cohorts and was found to be positively associated with the hypoxia-related carbonic anhydrase, CAIX, by gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry. We validated a novel clinical-radiomics model that is associated with OS and PFS among NSCLC patients treated with immunotherapy and identified a highly vulnerable subset of patients  that are unlikely to respond to immunotherapy. The most informative radiomic feature was associated with CAIX, a marker of tumor hypoxia, tumor acidosis, and treatment resistance.","Ilke Tunali,Yan Tan,Ilke Tunali,Yan Tan,Jhanelle E.

In a pathological examination of pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma, a resection margin without cancer cells in 1mm is recognized as R0; a resection margin with cancer cells in 1mm is recognized as R1. The preoperative identification of R0 and R1 is of great significance for surgical decision and prognosis. We conducted a preliminary radiomics study based on preoperative CT (computer tomography) images to evaluate a resection margin which was R0 or R1. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed 258 preoperative CT images of 86 patients (34 cases of R0 and 52 cases of R1) who were diagnosed as pancreatic head adenocarcinoma and underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. The radiomics study consists of five stages: (i) delineate and segment regions of interest (ROIs); (ii) by solving discrete Laplacian equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions, fit the ROIs to rectangular regions; (iii) enhance the textures of the fitted ROIs combining wavelet transform and fractional differential; (iv) extract texture features from the enhanced ROIs combining wavelet transform and statistical analysis methods; and (v) reduce features using principal component analysis (PCA) and classify the resection margins using the support vector machine (SVM), and then investigate the associations between texture features and histopathological characteristics using the Mann–Whitney U-test. To reduce overfitting, the SVM classifier embedded a linear kernel and adopted the leave-one-out cross-validation. Results. It achieved an AUC (area under receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0.8614 and an accuracy of 84.88%. Setting                      in the Mann–Whitney U-test, two features of the run-length matrix, which are derived from diagonal sub-bands in wavelet decomposition, showed statistically significant differences between R0 and R1.

However, whether hippocampal radiomic features are robust as predictors of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia and whether these features provide any neurobiological foundation remains unclear. The primary aim of this study was to verify whether hippocampal radiomic features can serve as robust MRI markers for AD. Multivariate classifier-based SVM analysis provided individual-level predictions for distinguishing AD patients (n=261) from normal controls (NCs; n=231) with an accuracy of 88.21% and intersite cross-validation. Further analyses of a large, independent ADNI dataset (n=1228) reinforced these findings. In MCI groups, a systemic analysis demonstrated that the identified features were significantly associated with clinical features (e.g., apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, polygenic risk scores, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ, CSF Tau), and longitudinal changes in cognition ability; more importantly, the radiomic features had a consistently altered pattern with changes in the MMSE scores over 5 years of follow-up. These comprehensive results suggest that hippocampal radiomic features can serve as robust biomarkers for clinical application in AD/MCI, and further provide evidence for predicting whether an MCI subject would convert to AD based on the radiomics of the hippocampus. The results of this study are expected to have a substantial impact on the early diagnosis of AD/MCI.","Kun Zhao,Kun Zhao,Yanhui Ding,Yanhui Ding,Ying Han,Ying Han,Yong Fan,Aaron Alexander-Bloch,Yong Fan,Aaron F.

METHODS: Five woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus following inoculation at birth and with confirmed hepatic tumors were imaged by contrast enhanced CT or MRI. Virtual 3D liver or tumor models were generated by segmentation of in vivo CT or MR imaging. A specimen-specific cavity was created inside a block containing cutting slots aligned with an imaging plane using computer-aided design software, and the final cutting molds were fabricated using a 3D printer. Livers were resected two days after initial imaging, fixed with formalin or left unfixed, inserted into the 3D molds, and cut into parallel pieces by passing a sharp blade through the parallel slots in the mold. Histopathology sections were acquired and their spatial overlap with in vivo image slices was quantified using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). RESULTS: Imaging of the woodchucks revealed heterogeneous hepatic tumors of varying size, number, and location. Specimen-specific 3D molds provided accurate co-localization of histopathology of whole livers, liver lobes, and pedunculated tumors with in vivo CT and MR imaging, with or without tissue fixation.

10.1007/s00330-020-06675-2,32086577.0,,MRI radiomics features predict immuno-oncological characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of qualitative and quantitative MRI radiomics features for noninvasive prediction of immuno-oncologic characteristics and outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: This retrospective, IRB-approved study included 48 patients with HCC (M/F 35/13, mean age 60y) who underwent hepatic resection or transplant within 4 months of abdominal MRI. Qualitative imaging traits, quantitative nontexture related and texture features were assessed in index lesions on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted images. The association of imaging features with immunoprofiling and genomics features was assessed using binary logistic regression and correlation analyses. Binary logistic regression analysis was also employed to analyse the association of radiomics, histopathologic and genomics features with radiological early recurrence of HCC at 12 months. RESULTS: Qualitative (r = - 0.41-0.40, p < 0.042) and quantitative (r = - 0.52-0.45, p < 0.049) radiomics features correlated with immunohistochemical cell type markers for T-cells (CD3), macrophages (CD68) and endothelial cells (CD31). Radiomics features also correlated with expression of immunotherapy targets PD-L1 at protein level (r = 0.41-0.47, p < 0.029) as well as PD1 and CTLA4 at mRNA expression level (r = - 0.48-0.47, p < 0.037). Finally, radiomics features, including tumour size, showed significant diagnostic performance for assessment of early HCC recurrence (AUC 0.76-0.80, p < 0.043), while immunoprofiling and genomic features did not (p = 0.098-0929). CONCLUSIONS: MRI radiomics features may serve as noninvasive predictors of HCC immuno-oncological characteristics and tumour recurrence and may aid in treatment stratification of HCC patients. These results need prospective validation. KEY POINTS: * MRI radiomics features showed significant associations with immunophenotyping and genomics characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma. * Radiomics features, including tumour size, showed significant associations with early hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after resection.","Stefanie Hectors,Sara Lewis,Stefanie J.

10.1088/1361-6560/ab8956,32294632.0,,Multifaceted radiomics for distant metastasis prediction in head & neck cancer.,"Accurately predicting distant metastasis in head & neck cancer has the potential to improve patient survival by allowing early treatment intensification with systemic therapy for high-risk patients. By extracting large amounts of quantitative features and mining them, radiomics has achieved success in predicting treatment outcomes for various diseases. However, there are several challenges associated with conventional radiomic approaches, including: 1) how to optimally combine information extracted from multiple modalities; 2) how to construct models emphasizing different objectives for different clinical applications; and 3) how to utilize and fuse output obtained by multiple classifiers. To overcome these challenges, we propose a unified model termed as multifaceted radiomics (M-radiomics). In M-radiomics, a deep learning with stacked sparse autoencoder is first utilized to fuse features extracted from different modalities into one representation feature set. A multi-objective optimization model is then introduced into M-radiomics where probability- based objective functions are designed to maximize the similarity between the probability output and the true label vector. Finally, M-radiomics employs multiple base classifiers to get a diverse Pareto-optimal model set and then fuses the output probabilities of all the Pareto-optimal models through an evidential reasoning rule fusion (ERRF) strategy in the testing stage to obtain the final output probability. Experimental results show that M-radiomics with the stacked autoencoder outperforms the model without the autoencoder. M-radiomics obtained more accurate results with a better balance between sensitivity and specificity than other single-objective or single-classifier–based models.","Zhiguo Zhou,Kai Wang,Zhiguo Zhou,Zhiguo Zhou,Michael R.

Several efforts have been made to identify imaging biomarkers to non-invasively detect and characterize PCa, with substantial improvements thanks to multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI). In recent years, diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) was proposed to be directly related to tissue physiological and pathological characteristic, while the radiomic approach was proven to be a key method to study cancer imaging phenotypes. Our aim was to compare a standard radiomic model for PCa detection, built using T2-weighted (T2W) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), with an advanced one, including DKI and quantitative Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE), while also evaluating differences in prediction performance when using 2D or 3D lesion segmentation. The obtained results in terms of diagnostic accuracy were high for all of the performed comparisons, reaching values up to 0.99 for the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and 0.98 for both sensitivity and specificity. In comparison, the radiomic model based on standard features led to prediction performances higher than those of the advanced model, while greater accuracy was achieved by the model extracted from 3D segmentation. These results provide new insights into active topics of discussion, such as choosing the most convenient acquisition protocol and the most appropriate postprocessing pipeline to accurately detect and characterize PCa.","Serena Monti,Valentina Brancato,Serena Monti,Valentina Brancato,Giuseppe Costanzo,Luca Basso,Giuseppe Di Costanzo,Luca Basso,Marta Puglia,Luca Basso,Alfonso Ragozzino,Marta Puglia,Alfonso Ragozzino,Marco Salvatore,Carlo Cavaliere,Marco Salvatore,Carlo Cavaliere",Cancers,2020.0

PURPOSE: To establish a multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)-based radiomics nomogram for preoperatively predicting LNM status. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: Among 233 consecutive patients, 155 patients were randomly allocated to the primary cohort and 78 patients to the validation cohort. FIELD STRENGTH: Radiomic features were extracted from a 1.5T mpMRI scan (T1 -weighted imaging [T1 WI], fat-saturated T2 -weighted imaging [FS-T2 WI], contrast-enhanced [CE], diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI], and apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] maps). ASSESSMENT: The performance of the nomogram was assessed with respect to its calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were also calculated. STATISTICAL TESTS: The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used for dimension reduction, feature selection, and radiomics signature building. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to develop the radiomics nomogram. An independent sample t-test and chi-squared test were used to compare the differences in continuous and categorical variables, respectively. RESULTS: The radiomic signature allowed a good discrimination between the LNM and non-LNM groups, with a C-index of 0.856 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.794-0.918) in the primary cohort and 0.883 (95% CI, 0.809-0.957) in the validation cohort. Additionally, the radiomics nomogram also had a good discriminating performance and yielded good calibration both in the primary and validation cohorts (C-index, 0.882 [95% CI, 0.827-0.937], C-index, 0.893 [95% CI, 0.822-0.964], respectively). Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the radiomics nomogram was clinically useful. DATA CONCLUSION: A radiomics nomogram was developed by incorporating the radiomics signature with the MRI-reported LN status and FIGO stage. This nomogram might be used to facilitate the individualized prediction of LNM in patients with early-stage cervical cancer.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, we defined a set of images acquired with a certain imaging protocol as a domain, and a total of 4 domains (A, B, C, and T [target]) from 3 different scanners were included. In dataset#1, 60 patinets for each domain were collected. Datasets#2 and #3 included 40 slices of spleen for each of the domains. In dataset#4, the slices of 3 colorectal cancer groups (n = 28, 38, and 32) were separately retrieved from 3 different scanners, and each group contained short-term and long-term survivors. 77 features were extracted for evaluation by comparing features distributions. First, we trained the GAN model on dataset#1 to learn how to normalize images from domains A, B, and C to T. Next, by comparing feature distributions between normalized images of the different domains, we identified the appropriate model and assessed it , in dataset #2 and dataset#3, respectively. Finally, to investigate whether our proposed method could facilitate multicenter radiomics analysis, we built the lasso classifier to distinguish short-term from long-term survivors based on a certain group in dataset#4, and validate it in another two groups, which formed a cross-validation between groups in dataset#4. RESULTS: After normalization, the percentage of aligned features between domains A vs T, B vs T, and C vs T increased from 10.4 %, 18.2%, and 50.1% to 93.5%, 89.6%, and 77.9%, respectively. In the cross-validation results, average improvement of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve achieved 11% (3%-32%).

PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of radiomics model in predicting early progression of unresectable HCC after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy using preoperative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI). STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: A total of 84 patients with BCLC B stage HCC from one medical center. According to the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors, patients who progressed at 6 months after TACE therapy were assigned as the progressive disease (PD) group (n = 32). Patients whose MRI was performed on four devices were divided into a training cohort (n = 67). Patients whose MRI was performed on other than the previous four devices were used as the testing set (n = 17). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0T, 1.5T axial T2 -weighted imaging (T2 WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI, b = 0, 500 s/mm(2) ), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ASSESSMENT: PD was confirmed via imaging studies with MRI. Risk factors, including age, alpha fetoprotein (AFP), size, and radiomic-related features of PD were assessed. In addition, the discrimination ability of each radiomics signature was tested on an independent testing set. STATISTICAL TESTS: The area under the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the radiomic signature in both the training and testing sets. The results indicated that the MP-MRI model achieved the greatest benefit. RESULTS: In the testing set, the model based on DWI features presented an AUC of (b = 0, 0.786; b = 500, 0.729), followed by T2 WI features (0.729) and ADC (0.714). The AUC of the MP-MRI signature was increased to 0.800 compared to any single MRI signature. The multivariate logistic analysis identified the radiomics signature as independent parameters of PD, while clinical information such as age, AFP, size, etc., had no significance in the PD group.

The clinical diagnostic criteria based on the size of the LNs are not sensitive to determine metastasis using CT images. In this retrospective study, we investigated the potential value of CT texture features to diagnose LN metastasis using preoperative CT data and patient characteristics by developing quantitative prediction models. METHODS: A total of 390 CC patients, undergone surgical resection, were enrolled in this monocentric study. 390 histologically validated LNs were collected from patients and randomly separated into training (312 patients, 155 metastatic and 157 normal LNs) and test cohorts (78 patients, 39 metastatic and 39 normal LNs). Six patient characteristics and 146 quantitative CT imaging features were analyzed and key variables were determined using either exhaustive search or least absolute shrinkage algorithm. Two kernel-based support vector machine classifiers (patient-characteristic model and radiomic-derived model), generated with 10-fold cross-validation, were compared with the clinical model that utilizes long-axis diameter for diagnosis of metastatic LN. The performance of the models was evaluated on the test cohort by computing accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). RESULTS: The clinical model had an overall diagnostic accuracy of 64.87%; specifically, accuracy of 65.38% and 62.82%, sensitivity of 83.87% and 84.62%, and specificity of 47.13% and 41.03% for training and test cohorts, respectively. The patient-demographic model obtained accuracy of 67.31% and 73.08%, the sensitivity of 62.58% and 69.23%, and specificity of 71.97% and 76.23% for training and test cohorts, respectively. Besides, the radiomic-derived model resulted in an accuracy of 81.09% and 79.49%, sensitivity of 83.87% and 74.36%, and specificity of 78.34% and 84.62% for training and test cohorts, respectively. Furthermore, the diagnostic performance of the radiomic-derived model was significantly higher than clinical and patient-demographic models (p < 0.02) according to the DeLong method. CONCLUSIONS: The texture of the LNs provided characteristic information about the histological status of the LNs. The radiomic-derived model leveraging LN texture provides better preoperative diagnostic accuracy for the detection of metastatic LNs compared to the clinically accepted diagnostic criteria and patient-demographic model.","Aydın Eresen,Yu Li,Aydin Eresen,Yu Li,Jia Yang,Yu Li,Yu Li,Yu Li,Junjie Shangguan,Jia Yang,Junjie Shangguan,Yuri S.

Hierarchical clustering was performed to preselect features. Classification was done using logistic regression. In the validation dataset, the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were compared between the models trained in the centralized and distributed manner. No difference in ROC was observed with respect to feature selection. The logistic regression coefficients were identical between the methods (absolute difference  0.05). In conclusion, both feature selection and classification are feasible in a distributed manner using radiomics data, which opens new possibility for training more reliable radiomics models.","Marta Bogowicz,Marta Bogowicz,Arthur Jochems,Arthur Jochems,Arthur Jochems,Arthur Jochems,Timo M.

Researchers have access to a library of file conversion, segmentation, quantitative image feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms. An interface is also provided to allow users to upload their own algorithms in Docker containers.

10.21037/jtd-2019-pitd-10,,,Radiogenomics of lung cancer.,"Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are aiding in improving sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic imaging. The rapid adoption of these advanced ML algorithms is transforming imaging analysis; taking us from noninvasive detection of pathology to noninvasive precise diagnosis of the pathology by identifying whether detected abnormality is a secondary to infection, inflammation and/or neoplasm. This is led to the emergence of ""Radiobiogenomics""; referring to the concept of identifying biologic (genomic, proteomic) alterations in the detected lesion. Radiobiogenomic involves image segmentation, feature extraction, and ML model to predict underlying tumor genotype and clinical outcomes. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer related death worldwide. There are several histologic subtypes of lung cancer, e.g., small cell lung cancer (SCLC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma). These variable histologic subtypes not only appear different at microscopic level, but these also differ at genetic and transcription level. This intrinsic heterogeneity reveals itself as different morphologic appearances on diagnostic imaging, such as CT, PET/CT and MRI. Traditional evaluation of imaging findings of lung cancer is limited to morphologic characteristics, such as lesion size, margins, density. Radiomics takes image analysis a step further by looking at imaging phenotype with higher order statistics in efforts to quantify intralesional heterogeneity. This heterogeneity, in turn, can be potentially used to extract intralesional genomic and proteomic data. This review aims to highlight novel concepts in ML and AI and their potential applications in identifying radiobiogenomics of lung cancer.","Christina G.

Radiomics beschreibt einen systematischen Zugang zur Erforschung pradiktiver Muster auf Basis der Integration klinischer, molekularer, genetischer und bildgebender Parameter, und Deep Learning ist mittlerweile die mit Abstand fuhrende Methode im Bereich der angewandten KI, die sich insbesondere fur das Durchforsten komplexer Daten nach ebensolchen pradiktiven und deskriptiven Mustern eignet. Wir beschreiben die Hintergrunde der rasanten Zunahme des wissenschaftlichen Interesses an diesen beiden Konzepten seitens der Krebsforschung, ihre Limitationen sowie mogliche Umsetzungsszenarien. Einschrankend ist festzustellen, dass die zugrunde liegenden Daten nicht standardisiert und vielerorts noch nicht integriert sind. Wahrend die initialen Radiomics-Ansatze auf einer Reihe manuell definierter Bildmerkmale beruhten, erlaubt die Kombination mit Deep Learning eine verbesserte Robustheit gegenuber einer variablen Datenqualitat und flexiblere Einsetzbarkeit.

10.1007/s00330-020-06666-3,32060715.0,,Radiomics of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in renal cell carcinoma-a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: (1) To assess the methodological quality of radiomics studies investigating histological subtypes, therapy response, and survival in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and (2) to determine the risk of bias in these radiomics studies. METHODS: In this systematic review, literature published since 2000 on radiomics in RCC was included and assessed for methodological quality using the Radiomics Quality Score. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool and a meta-analysis of radiomics studies focusing on differentiating between angiomyolipoma without visible fat and RCC was performed. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies investigating the use of radiomics in renal cancer were identified, including 4590 patients in total. The average Radiomics Quality Score was 3.41 (9.4% of total) with good inter-rater agreement (ICC 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.98). Three studies validated results with an independent dataset, one used a publically available validation dataset. None of the studies shared the code, images, or regions of interest. The meta-analysis showed moderate heterogeneity among the included studies and an odds ratio of 6.24 (95% CI 4.27-9.12; p < 0.001) for the differentiation of angiomyolipoma without visible fat from RCC. CONCLUSIONS: Radiomics algorithms show promise for answering clinical questions where subjective interpretation is challenging or not established. However, the generalizability of findings to prospective cohorts needs to be demonstrated in future trials for progression towards clinical translation. Improved sharing of methods including code and images could facilitate independent validation of radiomics signatures. KEY POINTS: * Studies achieved an average Radiomics Quality Score of 10.8%. Common reasons for low Radiomics Quality Scores were unvalidated results, retrospective study design, absence of open science, and insufficient control for multiple comparisons. * A previous training phase allowed reaching almost perfect inter-rater agreement in the application of the Radiomics Quality Score. * Meta-analysis of radiomics studies distinguishing angiomyolipoma without visible fat from renal cell carcinoma show moderate diagnostic odds ratios of 6.24 and moderate methodological diversity.","Stephan Ursprung,Lucian Beer,Stephan Ursprung,Annemarie Bruining,Lucian Beer,Lucian Beer,Ramona Woitek,Annemarie Bruining,Ramona Woitek,Grant D.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 390 confirmed NSCLC patients who performed chest CT scan and immunohistochemistry (IHC) examination of PD-L1 of lung tumors with clinic data were collected in this retrospective study, which were divided into two cohorts namely, training (n = 260) and validation (n = 130) cohort. Clinicopathologic features were compared between two cohorts. Lung tumors were segmented by using ITK-snap kit on CT images. Total 200 radiomic features in the segmented images were calculated using in-house texture analysis software, then filtered and minimized by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to select optimal radiomic features based on its relevance of PD-L1 expression status in IHC results and develop radiomics signature. Radiomics signature and clinicopathologic risk factors were incorporated to develop prediction model by using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the areas under the curves (AUC) were reckoned to predict PD-L1 expression in both training and validation cohorts. RESULTS: In 200 extracted radiomic features, 9 were selected to develop radiomics signature. In univariate analysis, PD-L1 expression of lung tumors was significantly correlated with radiomics signature, histologic type, and histologic grade (p   0.05). For prediction of PD-L1 expression, the prediction model that combines radiomics signature and clinicopathologic features resulted in AUCs of 0.829 and 0.848 in the training and validation cohort, respectively. CONCLUSION: The prediction model that incorporates the radiomics signature and clinical risk factors has potential to facilitate the individualized prediction of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC patients and identify patients who can benefit from anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy.","Zongqiong Sun,Shudong Hu,Zongqiong Sun,Yubin Ge,Shudong Hu,Jun Wang,Yuxi Ge,Jun Wang,Shaofeng Duan,Shao-Feng Duan,Jiayang Song,Chunhong Hu,Chunhong Hu,Jiayang Song,Yonggang Li,Yonggang Li,Chunhong Hu,Chunhong Hu,Yonggang Li",Journal of X-ray Science and Technology,2020.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-seven patients who underwent computed tomography due to renal mass and diagnosed with RCC as a result of pathological examination were retrospectively analyzed. In these analyses, the demographic characteristics, pathological and radiological findings of the patients were evaluated. The masses were introduced to the Radiomics extension of the software and the first- and second-order texture analysis parameters were obtained. The correlation of these parameters with histological subtype, Fuhrman grade and TNM stage was investigated. RESULTS: In the comparison of the Radiomics values by stages, ""minimum"", ""Long Run Low Gray-level Emphasis"" values were higher in the stage 1-2 group, while ""Energy"", ""Total energy"", ""Range"", ""Joint Average"", ""Sum Average"", ""Gray-Level Non-Uniformity"", ""Short-Run High Gray-level Emphasis "", ""Run Length Non-Uniformity ""and ""High Gray-Level Run Emphasis ""values were higher in the stage 3-4 group. Of these parameters, only ""Gray-Level Non-Uniformity"" and ""Run Length Non-Uniformity'' values were significantly lower in tumors with low Fuhrman grade (1-2) and low TNM stage (1-2). There was no statistically significant correlation between the parameters found to be significant in histological subtype differentiation and Fuhrman grade and TNM stage. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that ""Gray-Level Non-Uniformity"" and ""Run Length Non-Uniformity ""parameters in the texture analysis method can be used to evaluate the prognosis in patients with RCC.","Servan Yaşar,Servan Yaşar,Nuray Voyvoda,Bekir Voyvoda,Nuray Voyvoda,Tülay Özer,Bekir Voyvoda,Tülay Özer",Abdominal Radiology,2020.0

10.1007/s11307-020-01487-8,32185618.0,,next generation radiogenomics sequencing for prediction of egfr and kras mutation status in nsclc patients using multimodal imaging and machine learning algorithms,"PURPOSE: Considerable progress has been made in the assessment and management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients based on mutation status in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS). At the same time, NSCLC management through KRAS and EGFR mutation profiling faces challenges. In the present work, we aimed to evaluate a comprehensive radiomics framework that enabled prediction of EGFR and KRAS mutation status in NSCLC patients based on radiomic features from low-dose computed tomography (CT), contrast-enhanced diagnostic quality CT (CTD), and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging modalities and use of machine learning algorithms. METHODS: Our study involved NSCLC patients including 150 PET, low-dose CT, and CTD images. Radiomic features from original and preprocessed (including 64 bin discretizing, Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LOG), and Wavelet) images were extracted. Conventional clinically used standard uptake value (SUV) parameters and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) were also obtained from PET images. Highly correlated features were pre-eliminated, and false discovery rate (FDR) correction was performed with the resulting q-values reported for univariate analysis. Six feature selection methods and 12 classifiers were then used for multivariate prediction of gene mutation status (provided by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) in patients. We performed 10-fold cross-validation for model tuning to improve robustness, and our developed models were assessed on an independent validation set with 68 patients (common in all three imaging modalities). The average area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was utilized for performance evaluation. RESULTS: The best predictive power for conventional PET parameters was achieved by SUVpeak (AUC 0.69, p value = 0.0002) and MTV (AUC 0.55, p value = 0.0011) for EGFR and KRAS, respectively. Univariate analysis of extracted radiomics features improved AUC performance to 0.75 (q-value 0.003, Short-Run Emphasis feature of GLRLM from LOG preprocessed image of PET with sigma value 1.5) and 0.71 (q-value 0.00005, Large Dependence Low Gray-Level Emphasis feature of GLDM in LOG preprocessed image of CTD with sigma value 5) for EGFR and KRAS, respectively. Furthermore, multivariate machine learning-based AUC performances were significantly improved to 0.82 for EGFR (LOG preprocessed image of PET with sigma 3 with variance threshold (VT) feature selector and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) classifier (q-value = 4.86E-05) and 0.83 for KRAS (LOG preprocessed image of CT with sigma 3.5 with select model (SM) feature selector and SGD classifier (q-value = 2.81E-09). CONCLUSION: Our work demonstrated that non-invasive and reliable radiomics analysis can be successfully used to predict EGFR and KRAS mutation status in NSCLC patients. We demonstrated that radiomic features extracted from different image-feature sets could be used for EGFR and KRAS mutation status prediction in NSCLC patients and showed improved predictive power relative to conventional image-derived metrics.","Isaac Shiri,Hasan Maleki,Ghasem Hajianfar,Hamid Abdollahi,Saeed Ashrafinia,Mathieu Hatt,Habib Zaidi,Mehrdad Oveisi,Arman Rahmim",Molecular Imaging and Biology,2020.0

Methods One hundred and seventy-four consecutive patients with lung adenocarcinoma underwent (18F)-FDG PET/CT and EGFR gene testing were retrospectively analyzed. Radiomic features combined with clinicopathological factors to construct a random forest (RF) model to identify EGFR mutation status. The mutant/wild-type model was trained on a training group (n=139) and validated in an independent validation group (n=35). The second RF classifier predicting the 19/21 mutation site was also built and evaluated in an EGFR mutation subset (training group, n=80; validation group, n=25). Radiomic score and 5 clinicopathological factors were integrated into a multivariate Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model for predicting overall survival (OS). AUC (the area under the receiver characteristic curve) and C-index were calculated to evaluate the model's performance. Results Of 174 patients, 109 (62.6%) harbored EGFR mutations, 21L858R was the most common mutation type [55.9% (61/109)]. The mutant/wild-type model was identified in the training (AUC, 0.77) and validation (AUC, 0.71) groups. The 19/21 mutation site model had an AUC of 0.82 and 0.73 in the training and validation groups, respectively. The C-index of the CPH model was 0.757. The survival time between targeted therapy and chemotherapy for patients with EGFR mutations was significantly different (P=0.03).

Computed tomography has the potential to detect morphological changes in bone structure but can be challenging to analyse reliably and quantitatively. OBJECTIVES To develop a radiomics platform that allows the comparison of features from micro-CTs (µCT) of PSB in horses that sustained catastrophic fractures with horses that did not. To compare features calculated with a radiomics approach with features calculated from a previously published study that used quantitative µCT in the same specimens. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study of cadaver specimens of µCT images of PSBs using prospectively applied radiomics. METHODS Radiomics features were computed on standardised CT datasets to benchmark the software. Features from µCT images of PSBs from 8 horses that sustained PSB fracture and 8 controls were computed using the contralateral, intact forelimb from horses sustaining PSB fracture (cases, n=19) and all available forelimbs for controls (n=30). Two-hundred and fifteen radiomic features were calculated, and similar or comparable features were compared with those reported in a previous study that used the same specimens. RESULTS Morphologic features computed with the radiomics approach, such as volume, minor axis dimensions and anisotropy were highly correlated with previously published data. A high number of imperceptible radiomic features, such as entropy, coarseness, and histogram features were also found to be significantly different (P<0.01). The extent of the differences in image features for the cases and controls PSBs depends on radiomic calculation settings. MAIN LIMITATIONS Only datasets obtained from cadaver specimens were included in the study. CONCLUSIONS A radiomics approach for analysing µCT images of PSBs was able to identify and reproduce differences in image features in cases and controls. Furthermore, radiomics revealed many more imperceptible image features between cases and control PSBs.","Parminder S. Basran,Parminder S. Basran,Parminder S. Basran,Parminder S.

10.1038/s42256-020-0173-6,,,A shallow convolutional neural network predicts prognosis of lung cancer patients in multi-institutional computed tomography image datasets,"Lung cancer is the most common fatal malignancy in adults worldwide, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of lung cancer diagnoses. Computed tomography is routinely used in clinical practice to determine lung cancer treatment and assess prognosis. Here, we developed LungNet, a shallow convolutional neural network for predicting outcomes of patients with NSCLC. We trained and evaluated LungNet on four independent cohorts of patients with NSCLC from four medical centres: Stanford Hospital (n=129), H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute (n=185), MAASTRO Clinic (n=311) and Charite – Universitatsmedizin, Berlin (n=84). We show that outcomes from LungNet are predictive of overall survival in all four independent survival cohorts as measured by concordance indices of 0.62, 0.62, 0.62 and 0.58 on cohorts 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Furthermore, the survival model can be used, via transfer learning, for classifying benign versus malignant nodules on the Lung Image Database Consortium (n=1,010), with improved performance (AUC=0.85) versus training from scratch (AUC=0.82). LungNet can be used as a non-invasive predictor for prognosis in patients with NSCLC and can facilitate interpretation of computed tomography images for lung cancer stratification and prognostication. Predicting overall survival for patients with confirmed non-small-cell lung cancer is an important issue in clinical practice. The authors developed and validated in four independent patient cohorts a shallow convolutional neural network that can predict the outcomes of individuals using pre-treatment CT images.

Breast cancer exerts a lot of burden on the National Health Service(NHS) and is the second most common cancer in the UK as of 2018. New cases of breast cancer have been on the rise in the past decade, while the survival rate has been improving. The NHS breast cancer screening programled to an improvement in survival rate. The expansion of the screening programled to more mammograms, thereby putting more work on the hands of radiologists, and the issue of double reading further worsens the workload. The introduction of computer-aided detection(CAD) systems to help radiologists was found not to have the expected outcome of improving the performance of readers. Unreliability of CAD systems has led to the explosion of studies and development of applications with the potential use in breast imaging. The purported success recorded with the use of machine learning in breast radiology has led to people postulating ideas that AI will replace breast radiologists. Of course, AI has many applications and potential uses in radiology, but will it replace radiologists? We reviewed many articles on the use of AI in breast radiology to give future radiologists and radiologists full information on this topic.

Results: 270 patients were included and divided into training (n = 180) and validation sets (n = 90). Transfissural extension was significantly associated with positive LNs. For OS prediction, high- and low-risk groups were different according to the radiomics score, also after dividing the two groups according to reconstruction algorithms. Conclusions: a combined clinical–radiomics model was not superior to a single clinical or single radiomics model to predict positive LNs. A radiomics model was able to separate high-risk and low-risk patients for OS; CTs reconstructed with Iterative Reconstructions (IR) algorithm showed the best model performance.","Francesca Botta,Francesca Botta,Sara Raimondi,Sara Raimondi,Lisa Rinaldi,Federica Bellerba,Lisa Rinaldi,Lisa Rinaldi,Federica Bellerba,Federica Corso,Vincenzo Bagnardi,Federica Corso,Daniela Origgi,Vincenzo Bagnardi,Daniela Origgi,Rocco Minelli,Rocco Minelli,Giovanna Pitoni,Giovanna Pitoni,Francesco Petrella,Francesco Petrella,Lorenzo Spaggiari,Lorenzo Spaggiari,Alessio Giuseppe Morganti,Alessio G.

10.3390/diagnostics10050258,,,CT Texture Analysis Challenges: Influence of Acquisition and Reconstruction Parameters: A Comprehensive Review,"Texture analysis in medical imaging is a promising tool that is designed to improve the characterization of abnormal images from patients, to ultimately serve as a predictive or prognostic biomarker. However, the nature of image acquisition itself implies variability in each pixel/voxel value that could jeopardize the usefulness of texture analysis in the medical field. In this review, a search was performed to identify current published data for computed tomography (CT) texture reproducibility and variability. On the basis of this analysis, the critical steps were identified with a view of using texture analysis as a reliable tool in medical imaging. The need to specify the CT scanners used and the associated parameters in published studies is highlighted. Harmonizing acquisition parameters between studies is a crucial step for future texture analysis.","Mathilde Espinasse,Mathilde Espinasse,Mathilde Espinasse,Stéphanie Pitre-Champagnat,Stéphanie Pitre-Champagnat,Benoit Charmettant,Stéphanie Pitre-Champagnat,Stéphanie Pitre-Champagnat,Benoit Charmettant,François Boyer,Andreas Volk,François Bidault,Andreas Volk,Andreas Volk,Corinne Balleyguier,Nathalie Lassau,Corinne Balleyguier,Corinne Balleyguier,Nathalie Lassau,Caroline Caramella,Nathalie Lassau,Caroline Caramella",,2020.0

METHODS: Four commercial SPECT and SPECT/CT cameras were used to acquire images of a static cardiac phantom mimicking typical myorcardial perfusion imaging using 185 MBq of (99m)Tc. The effects of different image acquisition and reconstruction parameters, including number of views, view matrix size, attenuation correction, as well as image reconstruction related parameters (algorithm, number of iterations, number of subsets, type of post-reconstruction filter, and its associated parameters, including filter order and cut-off frequency) were studied. In total, 5,063 transverse views were reconstructed by varying the aforementioned factors. Eighty-seven radiomic features including first-, second-, and high-order textures were extracted from these images. To assess reproducibility and repeatability, the coefficient of variation (COV), as a widely adopted metric, was measured for each of the radiomic features over the different imaging settings. RESULTS: The Inverse Difference Moment Normalized (IDMN) and Inverse Difference Normalized (IDN) features from the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Run Percentage (RP) from the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLRLM), Zone Entropy (ZE) from the Gray Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM), and Dependence Entropy (DE) from the Gray Level Dependence Matrix (GLDM) feature sets were the only features that exhibited high reproducibility (COV   20%) against changes in imaging settings. The GLRLM (31.88%) and GLDM feature set (54.2%) had the highest (COV   20%) number of the reproducible features, respectively. Matrix size had the largest impact on feature variability as most of the features were not repeatable when matrix size was modified with 82.8% of them having a COV > 20%. CONCLUSION: The repeatability and reproducibility of SPECT/CT cardiac radiomic features under different imaging settings is feature-dependent. Different image acquisition and reconstruction protocols have variable effects on radiomic features. The radiomic features exhibiting low COV are potential candidates for future clinical studies.","Mohammad Edalat-Javid,Isaac Shiri,Ghasem Hajianfar,H.

The typical radiomic workflow includes image acquisition, segmentation, feature extraction, and analysis of high-dimensional datasets. While procedures for primary radiomic analyses have been established in recent years, processing the resulting radiomic datasets remains a challenge due to the lack of specific tools for doing so. Here we present RadAR (Radiomics Analysis with R), a new software to perform comprehensive analysis of radiomic features. RadAR allows users to process radiomic datasets in their entirety, from data import to feature processing and visualization, and implements multiple statistical methods for analysis of these data. We used RadAR to analyse the radiomic profiles of more than 850 cancer patients from publicly available datasets and showed that it was able to recapitulate expected results.

METHODS We enrolled 637 patients from two independent institutions. Patients from Institution I were randomly divided into a training cohort of 451 patients and a test cohort of 111 patients. Patients from Institution II served as an independent validation set. The LASSO algorithm was used for the selection of 798 radiomics features. Two classifiers for predicting MVI status and MVI risk were developed using multivariable logistic regression. We also performed a survival analysis to investigate the potentially prognostic value of the proposed MVI classifiers. RESULTS The developed radiomics signature predicted MVI status with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of .780, .776, and .743 in the training, test, and independent validation cohorts, respectively. The final MVI status classifier that integrated two clinical factors (age and α-fetoprotein level) achieved AUC of .806, .803, and .796 in the training, test, and independent validation cohorts, respectively. For MVI risk stratification, the AUCs of the radiomics signature were .746, .664, and .700 in the training, test, and independent validation cohorts, respectively, and the AUCs of the final MVI risk classifier-integrated clinical stage were .783, .778, and .740, respectively. Survival analysis showed that our MVI status classifier significantly stratified patients for short overall survival or early tumor recurrence.

10.1002/jum.15294,32329142.0,,Could Ultrasound-Based Radiomics Noninvasively Predict Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer?,"OBJECTIVES: This work aimed to investigate whether quantitative radiomics imaging features extracted from ultrasound (US) can noninvasively predict breast cancer (BC) metastasis to axillary lymph nodes (ALNs). METHODS: Presurgical B-mode US data of 196 patients with BC were retrospectively studied. The cases were divided into the training and validation cohorts (n = 141 versus 55). The elastic net regression technique was used for selecting features and building a signature in the training cohort. A linear combination of the selected features weighted by their respective coefficients produced a radiomics signature for each individual. A radiomics nomogram was established based on the radiomics signature and US-reported ALN status. In a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, areas under the curves (AUCs) were determined for assessing the accuracy of the prediction model in predicting ALN metastasis in both cohorts. The clinical value was assessed by a decision curve analysis. RESULTS: In all, 843 radiomics features per case were obtained from expert-delineated lesions on US imaging in this study. Through radiomics feature selection, 21 features were selected to constitute the radiomics signature for predicting ALN metastasis. Area under the curve values of 0.778 and 0.725 were obtained in the training and validation cohorts, respectively, indicating moderate predictive ability. The radiomics nomogram comprising the radiomics signature and US-reported ALN status showed the best performance for ALN detection in the training cohort (AUC, 0.816) but moderate performance in the validation cohort (AUC, 0.759). The decision curve showed that both the radiomics signature and nomogram displayed good clinical utility. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot radiomics study provided a noninvasive method for predicting presurgical ALN metastasis status in BC.","Xiaoying Qiu,Yongluo Jiang,Xiaoying Qiu,Yongluo Jiang,Qiyu Zhao,Chunhong Yan,Qiyu Zhao,Min Huang,Chunhong Yan,Min Huang,Tianan Jiang,Tian’an Jiang",Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine,2020.0
10.1007/s00330-020-06927-1,32472274.0,,Current status and quality of radiomics studies in lymphoma: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVES To perform a systematic review regarding the developments in the field of radiomics in lymphoma. To evaluate the quality of included articles by the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2), the phases classification criteria for image mining studies, and the radiomics quality scoring (RQS) tool. METHODS We searched for eligible articles in the MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE databases using the terms ""radiomics"", ""texture"" and ""lymphoma"". The included studies were divided into two categories: diagnosis-, therapy response- and outcome-related studies. The diagnosis-related studies were evaluated using the QUADAS-2; all studies were evaluated using the phases classification criteria for image mining studies and the RQS tool by two reviewers. RESULTS Forty-five studies were included; thirteen papers (28.9%) focused on the differential diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and glioblastoma (GBM). Thirty-two (71.1%) studies were classified as discovery science according to the phase classification criteria for image mining studies. The mean RQS score of all studies was 14.2% (ranging from 0.0 to 40.3%), and 23 studies (51.1%) were given a score of <10%. CONCLUSION The radiomics features could serve as diagnostic and prognostic indicators in lymphoma. However, the current conclusions should be interpreted with caution due to the suboptimal quality of the studies. In order to introduce radiomics into lymphoma clinical settings, the lesion segmentation and selection, the influence of the pathological pattern and the extraction of multiple modalities and multiple time points features need to be further studied. KEY POINTS • The radiomics approach may provide useful information for diagnosis, prediction of the therapy response, and outcome of lymphoma. • The quality of published radiomics studies in lymphoma has been suboptimal to date. • More studies are needed to examine lesion selection and segmentation, the influence of pathological patterns, and the extraction of multiple modalities and multiple time point features.","Hongxi Wang,Hongxi Wang,Yi Zhou,Yi Zhou,Li Li,Li Li,Li Li,Wenxiu Hou,Wenxiu Hou,Xuelei Ma,Rong Tian,Xuelei Ma,Rong Tian",European Radiology,2020.0

METHODS We retrospectively enrolled a total of 71 patients with distal bile duct stricture who underwent magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). For quantitative analysis, the average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value at suspected stricture sites was assessed on both Z-DWI and conventional DWI (C-DWI). For qualitative analysis, two reviewers independently reviewed two image sets containing different diffusion-weighted images, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed. Several MRTA parameters were extracted from the area of the stricture on the ADC map of the ZOOMit coronal diffusion-weighted images using commercially available software. RESULTS Among 71 patients, 26 patients were diagnosed with malignant stricture. On quantitative analysis, the average ADC value of the malignant and benign strictures, using Z-DWI, was 1.124×10-3 mm2/s and 1.522×10-3 mm2/s, respectively (P<0.001). The average ADC value of the malignant and benign strictures, using C-DWI, was 1.107×10-3 mm2/s and 1.519×10-3 mm2/s, respectively (P<0.001). On qualitative analysis, for each reviewer, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values for differentiating benign from malignant stricture was 0.928 and 0.939, respectively, for the ZOOMit diffusion set and 0.851 and 0.824, respectively, for the conventional diffusion set. Multiple MRTA parameters showed a significantly different distribution for the benign and malignant strictures, including mean, entropy, mean of positive pixels, and kurtosis at spatial filtration values of 0, 5, and 6mm. CONCLUSION The addition of Z-DWI to conventional MRCP is helpful in differentiating benign from malignant bile duct strictures, and some MRTA parameters also can be helpful in differentiating benign from malignant distal bile duct strictures.","Ki Choon Sim,Ki Choon Sim,Beom Jin Park,Na Han,Tae Hyung Kim,Beom Jin Park,Deuk Jae Sung,Na Yeon Han,Min Ju Kim,Deuk Jae Sung,Min Ju Kim,Yeo Eun Han,Yeo Eun Han",Abdominal Radiology,2020.0

In addition to improved resolution as well as whole-body and faster image acquisition, the possibilities of functional and molecular examination of tissue pathophysiology have had adecisive influence on imaging diagnostics and provided ground-breaking knowledge. Many promising approaches are currently being pursued to increase the application area of devices and contrast media and to improve their sensitivity and quantitative informative value. These are complemented by new methods of data processing, multiparametric data analysis, and integrated diagnostics. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of technological innovations that will enrich clinical imaging in the future, and to highlight the resultant diagnostic options.

METHODS A retrospective dataset involving 218 and 51 patients with histology-confirmed benign and malignant epithelial salivary gland tumors was used in this study. A total of 396 radiomic features were extracted from the DW images. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) were used to select optimal radiomic features. The selected features were used to build three classification models namely, logistic regression method (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) by using a five-fold cross validation strategy on the training dataset. The diagnostic performance of each classification model was quantified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the ROC curve (AUC) in the training and validation datasets. RESULTS Eight most valuable features were selected by LASSO. LR and SVM models yielded optimally diagnostic performance. In the training dataset, LR and SVM yielded AUC values of 0.886 and 0.893 via five-fold cross validation, respectively, while KNN model showed relatively lower AUC (0.796). In the testing dataset, a similar result was found, where AUC values for LR, SVM, and KNN were 0.876, 0.870, and 0.791, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Classification models based on optimally selected radiomics features computed from DW images present a promising predictive value in distinguishing benign and malignant epithelial salivary gland tumors and thus have potential to be used for preoperative auxiliary diagnosis.","Shuo Shao,Ning Mao,Shuo Shao,Ning Mao,Wenjuan Liu,Wenjuan Liu,Jingjing Cui,Xiaoli Xue,Jingjing Cui,Jingfeng Cheng,Xiaoli Xue,Ning Zheng,Jingfeng Cheng,Bin Wang,Ning Zheng,Bin Wang",Journal of X-ray Science and Technology,2020.0

10.1016/j.jhepr.2020.100100,,,Evaluation of liver tumour response by imaging.,"Summary  The goal of assessing tumour response on imaging is to identify patients who are likely to benefit — or not — from anticancer treatment, especially in relation to survival. The World Health Organization was the first to develop assessment criteria. This early score, which assessed tumour burden by standardising lesion size measurements, laid the groundwork for many of the criteria that followed. This was then improved by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) which was quickly adopted by the oncology community. At the same time, many interventional oncology treatments were developed to target specific features of liver tumours that result in significant changes in tumours but have little effect on tumour size. New criteria focusing on the viable part of tumours were therefore designed to provide more appropriate feedback to guide patient management. Targeted therapy has resulted in a breakthrough that challenges conventional response criteria due to the non-linear relationship between response and tumour size, requiring the development of methods that emphasize the appearance of tumours. More recently, research into functional and quantitative imaging has created new opportunities in liver imaging. These results have suggested that certain parameters could serve as early predictors of response or could predict later tumour response at baseline. These approaches have now been extended by machine learning and deep learning. This clinical review focuses on the progress made in the evaluation of liver tumours on imaging, discussing the rationale for this approach, addressing challenges and controversies in the field, and suggesting possible future developments.","Jules Grégory,Jules Gregory,Marco Dioguardi Burgio,Marco Dioguardi Burgio,Giuseppe Corrias,Marco Dioguardi Burgio,Marco Dioguardi Burgio,Giuseppe Corrias,Valérie Vilgrain,Giuseppe Corrias,Maxime Ronot,Valérie Vilgrain,Valérie Vilgrain,Maxime Ronot,Maxime Ronot",,2020.0
10.1016/j.ymeth.2020.06.020,32634555.0,,Functional imaging using radiomic features in assessment of lymphoma.,"Abstract   Lymphomas are typically large, well-defined, and relatively homogeneous tumors, and therefore represent ideal targets for the use of radiomics. Of the available functional imaging tests, [18F]FDG-PET for body lymphoma and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) for central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma are of particular interest. The current literature suggests that two main applications for radiomics in lymphoma show promise: differentiation of lymphomas from other tumors, and lymphoma treatment response and outcome prognostication. In particular, encouraging results reported in the limited number of presently available studies that utilize functional imaging suggest that (1) MRI-based radiomics enables differentiation of CNS lymphoma from glioblastoma, and (2) baseline [18F]FDG-PET radiomics could be useful for survival prognostication, adding to or even replacing commonly used metrics such as standardized uptake values and metabolic tumor volume. However, due to differences in biological and clinical characteristics of different lymphoma subtypes and an increasing number of treatment options, more data are required to support these findings. Furthermore, a consensus on several critical steps in the radiomics workflow –most importantly, image reconstruction and post processing, lesion segmentation, and choice of classification algorithm– is desirable to ensure comparability of results between research institutions.","Marius E.

POPULATION An initial cohort of 293 patients with pathologically confirmed HCC was involved in this study, and patients were randomly divided into training (195) and validation (98) cohorts. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCES Contrast-enhanced T1 -weight MRI was performed with a 1.5T scanner. ASSESSMENT A total of 853 radiomic features were extracted from the volume imaging. Univariate analysis and Fisher scoring were utilized for feature reduction. Subsequently, forward stepwise feature selection and radiomics signature building were performed based on a support vector machine (SVM). Incorporating independent risk factors, a combined nomogram was developed by multivariable logistic regression modeling.

Therefore, preoperative, noninvasive, and accurate prediction of SLM is crucial for personalized treatment strategies. Recently, radiomics has been considered as an advanced image analysis method to evaluate the neoplastic heterogeneity with respect to diagnosis of the tumor and prediction of prognosis. In this study, a total of 1409 radiomics features were extracted for each volume of interest (VOI) from high-resolution T2WI images of the primary RC. Subsequently, five optimal radiomics features were selected based on the training set using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method to construct the radiomics signature. In addition, radiomics signature combined with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) was included in the multifactor logistic regression to construct the nomogram model. It showed an optimal predictive performance in the validation set as compared to that in the radiomics model. The favorable calibration of the radiomics nomogram showed a nonsignificant Hosmer-Lemeshow test statistic (P>.05). The decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that the radiomics nomogram is clinically superior to the radiomics model. Therefore, the nomogram amalgamating the radiomics signature and clinical risk factors serve as an effective quantitative approach to predict the SLM of primary RC.","Minglu Liu,Minglu Liu,Xiaolu Ma,Shoukuan Fu,Xiaolu Ma,Fu Shen,Yuwei Xia,Yuwei Xia,Yan Jia,Jianping Lu,Jianping Lu,Yan Jia,Jianping Lu",,2020.0
10.1002/mp.13678,,,Machine and deep learning methods for radiomics.,": Radiomics is an emerging area in quantitative image analysis that aims to relate large-scale extracted imaging information to clinical and biological endpoints. The development of quantitative imaging methods along with machine learning has enabled the opportunity to move data science research towards translation for more personalized cancer treatments. Accumulating evidence has indeed demonstrated that noninvasive advanced imaging analytics, that is, radiomics, can reveal key components of tumor phenotype for multiple three-dimensional lesions at multiple time points over and beyond the course of treatment. These developments in the use of CT, PET, US, and MR imaging could augment patient stratification and prognostication buttressing emerging targeted therapeutic approaches. In recent years, deep learning architectures have demonstrated their tremendous potential for image segmentation, reconstruction, recognition, and classification. Many powerful open-source and commercial platforms are currently available to embark in new research areas of radiomics. Quantitative imaging research, however, is complex and key statistical principles should be followed to realize its full potential. The field of radiomics, in particular, requires a renewed focus on optimal study design/reporting practices and standardization of image acquisition, feature calculation, and rigorous statistical analysis for the field to move forward. In this article, the role of machine and deep learning as a major computational vehicle for advanced model building of radiomics-based signatures or classifiers, and diverse clinical applications, working principles, research opportunities, and available computational platforms for radiomics will be reviewed with examples drawn primarily from oncology. We also address issues related to common applications in medical physics, such as standardization, feature extraction, model building, and validation.","Michele Avanzo,Lin-Hung Wei,Michele Avanzo,Lise Wei,Joseph Stancanello,Joseph Stancanello,Martin Vallières,Arvind Rao,Martin Vallières,Arvind Rao,Arvind Rao,Olivier Morin,Olivier Morin,Sarah A.

10.3389/fonc.2020.00563,,,Multi-Habitat Based Radiomics for the Prediction of Treatment Response to Concurrent Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy in Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer.,"Objectives: To develop a radiomic model based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting treatment response prior to commencing concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CCRT) for locally advanced cervical cancer. Materials and Methods: The retrospective study enrolled 120 patients (allocated to a training or a test set) with locally advanced cervical cancer who underwent CCRT between December 2014 and June 2017. All patients enrolled underwent MRI with 9 sequences before treatment and again at the end of the fourth week of treatment. Responses were evaluated by MRI according to RECIST standards, and patients were divided into responder group or non-responder group. For every MRI sequence, a total of 114 radiomic features were extracted from the outlined tumour habitat. On the training set, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method was used to select key features and to construct 9 habitat signatures. Then, three kinds of machine learning models were compared and applied to integrate these predictive signatures and the clinical characteristics into a radiomic model. The discrimination ability, reliability and calibration of our radiomic model were evaluated. Results: The radiomic model, which consisted of 3 habitat signatures from sagittal T2 image, axial T1 enhanced-MRI image and ADC image respectively, has shown good predictive performance, with area under the curve of 0.820 (95% CI: 0.713-0.927) in the training set and 0.798 (95% CI: 0.678-0.917) in the test set. Meanwhile, the model was proved to perform better than each single signature or clinical characteristic. Conclusions: A radiomic model employing features from multiple tumour habitats held the ability for predicting treatment response in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer, before commencing CCRT. These results illustrated a potential new tool for improving medical decision-making and therapeutic strategies.","Mengjie Fang,Mengjie Fang,Yangyang Kan,Yangyang Kan,Yangyang Kan,Di Dong,Di Dong,Tao Yu,Tao Yu,Tao Yu,Tao Yu,Nannan Zhao,Wenyan Jiang,Nannan Zhao,Wenyan Jiang,Lianzhen Zhong,Wenyan Jiang,C.

10.3390/cancers12071707,32605068.0,,Multi-Habitat Radiomics Unravels Distinct Phenotypic Subtypes of Glioblastoma with Clinical and Genomic Significance.,"We aimed to evaluate the potential of radiomics as an imaging biomarker for glioblastoma (GBM) patients and explore the molecular rationale behind radiomics using a radio-genomics approach. A total of 144 primary GBM patients were included in this study (training cohort). Using multi-parametric MR images, radiomics features were extracted from multi-habitats of the tumor. We applied Cox-LASSO algorithm to build a survival prediction model, which we validated using an independent validation cohort. GBM patients were consensus clustered to reveal inherent phenotypic subtypes. GBM patients were successfully stratified by the radiomics risk score, a weighted sum of radiomics features, corroborating the potential of radiomics as a prognostic biomarker. Using consensus clustering, we identified three distinct subtypes which significantly differed in the prognosis (“heterogenous enhancing”, “rim-enhancing necrotic”, and “cystic” subtypes). Transcriptomic traits enriched in individual subtypes were in accordance with imaging phenotypes summarized by radiomics. For example, rim-enhancing necrotic subtype was well described by radiomics profiling (T2 autocorrelation and flat shape) and highlighted by the inflammatory genomic signatures, which well correlated to its phenotypic peculiarity (necrosis). This study showed that imaging subtypes derived from radiomics successfully recapitulated the genomic underpinnings of GBMs and thereby confirmed the feasibility of radiomics as an imaging biomarker for GBM patients with comprehensible biologic annotation.","Seung Won Choi,Seung Won Choi,Hwan Ho Cho,Harim Koo,Hwan-ho Cho,Sang-Ku Park,Harim Koo,Kyung Rae Cho,Karl-Heinz Nenning,Karl-Heinz Nenning,Karl Heinz Nenning,Georg Langs,Julia Furtner,Georg Langs,Julia Furtner,Bernhard Baumann,Bernhard Baumann,Adelheid Wöehrer,Adelheid Woehrer,Hee Jin Cho,K.

10.1186/s12880-020-00470-7,32641095.0,,Noninvasive model for predicting future ischemic strokes in patients with silent lacunar infarction using radiomics,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate integrating radiomics with clinical factors in cranial computed tomography (CT) to predict ischemic strokes in patients with silent lacunar infarction (SLI). METHODS Radiomic features were extracted from baseline cranial CT images of patients with SLI. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-Cox regression analysis was used to select significant prognostic factors based on ModelC with clinical factors, ModelR with radiomic features, and ModelCR with both factors. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare stroke-free survival probabilities. A nomogram and a calibration curve were used for further evaluation. RESULTS Radiomic signature (p<0.01), age (p=0.09), dyslipidemia (p=0.03), and multiple infarctions (p=0.02) were independently associated with future ischemic strokes. ModelCR had the best accuracy with 6-, 12-, and 18-month areas under the curve of 0.84, 0.81, and 0.79 for the training cohort and 0.79, 0.88, and 0.75 for the validation cohort, respectively. Patients with a ModelCR score<0.17 had higher probabilities of stroke-free survival. The prognostic nomogram and calibration curves of the training and validation cohorts showed acceptable discrimination and calibration capabilities (concordance index [95% confidence interval]: 0.7864 [0.70-0.86]; 0.7140 [0.59-0.83], respectively). CONCLUSIONS Radiomic analysis based on baseline CT images may provide a novel approach for predicting future ischemic strokes in patients with SLI. Older patients and those with dyslipidemia or multiple infarctions are at higher risk for ischemic stroke and require close monitoring and intensive intervention.","Jie-hua Su,Jie-hua Su,Lingwei Meng,Lingwei Meng,Di Dong,Di Dong,Wenyan Zhuo,Wen-yan Zhuo,Jianming Wang,Libin Liu,Jian-ming Wang,Li-bin Liu,Yi Qin,Ye Tian,Yi Qin,Ye Tian,Jie Tian,Zhaohui Li,Jie Tian,Zhao-hui Li",BMC Medical Imaging,2020.0

A total of 105 lesions from 88 patients who underwent CCTA and invasive fractional flow reserve measurement were collected as the training set, and another 31 patients with CCTA and clinical outcome information were used as the validation set. Conventional CCTA features included the stenosis diameter, length, Agatston score and high-risk plaque characteristics. After extracting and selecting radiomics features, the robustness of the radiomics features was examined, and then conventional and radiomics models were established using logistic regressions. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and Net Reclassification Index (NRI) were analysed to compare the discrimination and classification abilities between the two models in both the training and validation sets. A total of 1409 radiomics features were extracted, and three wavelet features were finally screened out. The robustness test showed good stability for the refined radiomics features. Compared with the conventional model, the radiomics model displayed a significantly improved diagnostic performance in the training set (AUC 0.762 vs. 0.631, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.671-0.853 vs. 0.519-0.742, P=0.058) but a slightly improved diagnostic performance in the validation set (AUC 0.671 vs. 0.592, 95% CI 0.466-0.875 vs. 0.519-0.742, P=0.448). The NRI of the radiomics model was increased in both the training and validation sets (NRI 0.198 and 0.238, respectively). Quantitative radiomics analysis was feasible and might help to improve the diagnostic performance of CCTA but is still controversial for predicting MACE.","Wenchao Hu,Xiangjun Wu,Wenchao Hu,Di Dong,Xiangjun Wu,Long‐Biao Cui,Di Dong,Long-Biao Cui,Min Jiang,Jibin Zhang,Min Jiang,Yabin Wang,Jibin Zhang,Xinjiang Wang,Yabin Wang,Lei Gao,Xinjiang Wang,Lei Gao,L Gao,Jie Tian,Jie Tian,Feng Cao,Feng Cao",,2020.0

METHODS: We analyzed 435 primary tumors (326 for training, 109 for validation) and 741 metastatic cervical lymph nodes (518 for training, 223 for validation) using FDG-PET and non-contrast CT from a multi-institutional and multi-national cohort. Utilizing 1037 radiomics features per imaging modality and per lesion, we trained, optimized, and independently validated machine-learning classifiers for prediction of HPV association in primary tumors, lymph nodes, and combined ""virtual"" volumes of interest (VOI). PET-based models were additionally validated in an external cohort. RESULTS: Single-modality PET and CT final models yielded similar classification performance without significant difference in independent validation; however, models combining PET and CT features outperformed single-modality PET- or CT-based models, with receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78, and 0.77 for prediction of HPV association using primary tumor lesion features, in cross-validation and independent validation, respectively. In the external PET-only validation dataset, final models achieved an AUC of 0.83 for a virtual VOI combining primary tumor and lymph nodes, and an AUC of 0.73 for a virtual VOI combining all lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: We found that PET-based radiomics signatures yielded similar classification performance to CT-based models, with potential added value from combining PET- and CT-based radiomics for prediction of HPV status. While our results are promising, radiomics signatures may not yet substitute tissue sampling for clinical decision-making.","Stefan P. Haider,Stefan P.

10.1038/s41598-020-66110-w,32581221.0,,Performance comparison of modified ComBat for harmonization of radiomic features for multicenter studies.,"Multicenter studies are needed to demonstrate the clinical potential value of radiomics as a prognostic tool. However, variability in scanner models, acquisition protocols and reconstruction settings are unavoidable and radiomic features are notoriously sensitive to these factors, which hinders pooling them in a statistical analysis. A statistical harmonization method called ComBat was developed to deal with the ""batch effect"" in gene expression microarray data and was used in radiomics studies to deal with the ""center-effect"". Our goal was to evaluate modifications in ComBat allowing for more flexibility in choosing a reference and improving robustness of the estimation. Two modified ComBat versions were evaluated: M-ComBat allows to transform all features distributions to a chosen reference, instead of the overall mean, providing more flexibility. B-ComBat adds bootstrap and Monte Carlo for improved robustness in the estimation. BM-ComBat combines both modifications. The four versions were compared regarding their ability to harmonize features in a multicenter context in two different clinical datasets. The first contains 119 locally advanced cervical cancer patients from 3 centers, with magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography imaging. In that case ComBat was applied with 3 labels corresponding to each center. The second one contains 98 locally advanced laryngeal cancer patients from 5 centers with contrast-enhanced computed tomography. In that specific case, because imaging settings were highly heterogeneous even within each of the five centers, unsupervised clustering was used to determine two labels for applying ComBat. The impact of each harmonization was evaluated through three different machine learning pipelines for the modelling step in predicting the clinical outcomes, across two performance metrics (balanced accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient). Before harmonization, almost all radiomic features had significantly different distributions between labels. These differences were successfully removed with all ComBat versions. The predictive ability of the radiomic models was always improved with harmonization and the improved ComBat provided the best results. This was observed consistently in both datasets, through all machine learning pipelines and performance metrics. The proposed modifications allow for more flexibility and robustness in the estimation. They also slightly but consistently improve the predictive power of resulting radiomic models.","Ronrick Da-ano,R. Da-ano,Ingrid Masson,François Lucia,Ingrid Masson,M. Doré,F. Lucia,Philippe Robin,M.

Materials and methods 92 MRI cases including 52 HER2 2+ positive and 40 negative patients confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization were retrospectively selected. The lesion area was semi-automatically delineated, and a total of 488 texture features were respectively extracted from precontrast, postcontrast, and subtraction images. The Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was performed to identify statistically significant features between different HER2 2+ amplification groups. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to search for the optimal feature subsets. Three machine learning classifiers, logistic regression analysis (LRA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM), were used with a leave-one-out cross validation method to establish the classification models of HER2 2+ status. Classification performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.   Results Based on the texture analysis with SVM model, the areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) were 0.890 for subtraction images, 0.736 for postcontrast images, and 0.672 for precontrast images, respectively. For LRA model, the AUCs were 0.884, 0.733, and 0.623, respectively. For QDA model, the AUCs were 0.831, 0.726, and 0.568, respectively. LRA and the SVM model with subtraction images reached significantly better performance than the QDA model (P = 0.0227 and P = 0.0088, respectively).   Conclusion Texture features of breast cancer extracted from DCE-MRI are associated with HER2 2+ status.

10.1002/ctm2.31,32508036.0,,Prognostic and predictive value of radiomics signatures in stage I-III colon cancer.,"Accurate identification of patients with poor prognosis after radical surgery is essential for clinical management of colon cancer. Thus, we aimed to develop death and relapse specific radiomics signatures to individually estimate overall survival (OS) and relapse free survival (RFS) of colon cancer patients. In this study, 701 stage I-III colon cancer patients were identified from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. A total of 647 three-dimensional features were extracted from computed tomography images. LASSO Cox was used to identify the significantly death- and relapse-associated features and to build death and relapse specific radiomics signatures, respectively. A total of 13 death-specific and 26 relapse-specific features were identified from 647 screened radiomics features. The developed signatures can divide patients into two groups with significantly different death (Hazard Ratio (HR): 3.053; 95% CI, 1.78-5.23; P<.001) or relapse risk (HR: 2.794; 95% CI, 1.87-4.16; P<.001). Time-dependent Relative operating characteristic curve showed that the signatures performed better than any other clinicopathological factors in predicting OS (AUC: 0.768; 95% CI, 0.745-0.791) and RFS (AUC: 0.744; 95% CI, 0.687-0.801). Further, survival decision curve analyses confirmed the good clinical utility of the two radiomics signatures. In conclusion, we successfully developed death- and relapse-specific radiomics signatures that can accurately predict OS and RFS, which may facilitate personalized treatment.","Weixing Dai,Shaobo Mo,Weixing Dai,Lingyu Han,Shaobo Mo,Lingyu Han,Wenqiang Xiang,Wenqiang Xiang,Menglei Li,Menglei Li,Ren‐Jie Wang,Tong Tong,Renjie Wang,Tong Tong,Tong Tong,Tong Tong,Tong Tong,Guoxiang Cai,Guoxiang Cai",,2020.0

So far, this problem has mainly been tackled in test-retest analyses. In this work we analyze radiomics feature stability based on probabilistic segmentations. Based on a public lung cancer dataset, we generate an arbitrary number of plausible segmentations using a Probabilistic U-Net. From these segmentations, we extract a high number of plausible feature vectors for each lung tumor and analyze feature variance with respect to the segmentations. Our results suggest that there are groups of radiomic features that are more (e.g. statistics features) and less (e.g. gray-level size zone matrix features) robust against segmentation variability. Finally, we demonstrate that segmentation variance impacts the performance of a prognostic lung cancer survival model and propose a new and potentially more robust radiomics feature selection workflow.","Christoph Haarburger,Christoph Haarburger,Justus Schock,Justus Schock,Daniel Truhn,Philippe Weitz,Daniel Truhn,Philippe Weitz,Gustav Mueller-Franzes,Leon Weninger,Gustav Mueller-Franzes,Dorit Merhof,Leon Weninger,Dorit Merhof",,2020.0

The imaging and clinical data were split into training (n = 105) and validation cohorts (n = 123). Two of the most cited open-source feature extractors, IBEX (1563 features) and Pyradiomics (1319 features), and our in-house software, Columbia Image Feature Extractor (CIFE) (1160 features), were used to extract radiomics features. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed sequentially to predict EGFR mutation status using each individual feature extractor. Our univariate analysis integrated an unsupervised clustering method to identify nonredundant and informative candidate features for the creation of prediction models by multivariate analyses. In training, unsupervised clustering-based univariate analysis identified 5, 6, and 4 features from IBEX, Pyradiomics, and CIFE as candidate features, respectively. Multivariate prediction models using these features from IBEX, Pyradiomics, and CIFE yielded similar areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.68, 0.67, and 0.69. However, in validation, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of multivariate prediction models from IBEX, Pyradiomics, and CIFE decreased to 0.54, 0.56 and 0.64, respectively. Different feature extractors select different radiomics features, which leads to prediction models with varying performance. However, correlation between those selected features from different extractors may indicate these features measure similar imaging phenotypes associated with similar biological characteristics. Overall, attention should be paid to the generalizability of individual radiomics features and radiomics prediction models.","Liwu Lin,Lin Lu,Shen-Su Sun,Lin Lu,Shawn H Sun,Shawn H.

Currently available clinical prediction models poorly predict treatment outcomes in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Therefore, we used radiomic features of primary pancreatic tumors to develop outcome prediction models and compared them to traditional clinical models. (2) Methods: We extracted and analyzed radiomic data from pre-radiation contrast-enhanced CTs of 74 pancreatic cancer patients undergoing stereotactic body radiotherapy. A panel of over 800 radiomic features was screened to create overall survival and local-regional recurrence prediction models, which were compared to clinical prediction models and models combining radiomic and clinical information. (3) Results: A 6-feature radiomic signature was identified that achieved better overall survival prediction performance than the clinical model (mean concordance index: 0.66 vs. 0.54 on resampled cross-validation test sets), and the combined model improved the performance slightly further to 0.68. Similarly, a 7-feature radiomic signature better predicted recurrence than the clinical model (mean AUC of 0.78 vs. 0.66).

METHODS We analyzed MR images of 17 GBM patients including T1 and T2-weighted images (performed within the same imaging unit on two consecutive days). For image segmentation, we used a comprehensive segmentation approach including entire tumor, active area of tumor, necrotic regions in T1-weighted images, and edema regions in T2-weighted images (test studies only; registration to retest studies is discussed next). Analysis included N3, N4 as well as no bias correction performed on raw MR images. We evaluated 20 image registration approaches, generated by cross-combination of 4 transformation and 5 cost function methods. In total, 714 images (17 patients × 2 images × ((4 transformations × 5 cost functions) + 1 test image) and 2856 segmentations (714 images × 4 segmentations) were prepared for feature extraction. Various radiomic features were extracted, including the use of pre-processing filters, specifically wavelet (WAV) and Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG), as well as discretizations into fixed bin width and fixed bin count (16, 32, 64, 128 and 256), Exponential, Gradient, Logarithm, Square and Square Root scales. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to assess repeatability of MRI radiomic features (high repeatability defined as ICC ≥ 95%). RESULTS In our ICC results, we observed high repeatability (ICC ≥ 95%) with respect to image preprocessing, different image registration algorithms and test-retest analysis, for: RLNU and GLNU from GLRLM, GLNU and DNU from GLDM, Coarseness and Busyness from NGTDM, GLNU and ZP from GLSZM, and Energy and RMS from first order. Highest fraction (percent) of repeatable features were observed, amongst registration techniques, for the method Full Affine transformation with 12 degrees of freedom using Mutual Information cost function (mean 32.4%), and amongst image processing methods, for the method Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) with Sigma (2.5-4.5 mm) (mean 78.9%). The trends were relatively consistent for N4, N3 or no bias correction. CONCLUSION Our results showed varying performances in repeatability of MR radiomic features for GBM tumors due to test-retest and image registration. The findings have implications for appropriate usage in diagnostic and predictive models.","Isaac Shiri,Isaac Shiri,Ghasem Hajianfar,Ahmad Sohrabi,Ahmad Sohrabi,Ghasem Hajianfar,Ahmad Sohrabi,Hamid Abdollahi,Sajad P.

We investigated whether [18F]FDG-PET radiomic texture features can improve prediction of bone marrow involvement in MCL, compared to standardized uptake values (SUV), and whether combination with laboratory data improves results. Ninety-seven MCL patients were retrospectively included. SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak and 16 co-occurrence matrix texture features were extracted from pelvic bones on [18F]FDG-PET/CT. A multi-layer perceptron neural network was used to compare three combinations for prediction of bone marrow involvement—the SUVs, a radiomic signature based on SUVs and texture features, and the radiomic signature combined with laboratory parameters. This step was repeated using two cut-off values for relative bone marrow involvement: REL > 5% (>5% of red/cellular bone marrow); and REL > 10%. Biopsy demonstrated bone marrow involvement in 67/97 patients (69.1%). SUVs, the radiomic signature, and the radiomic signature with laboratory data showed AUCs of up to 0.66, 0.73, and 0.81 for involved vs. uninvolved bone marrow; 0.68, 0.84, and 0.84 for REL ≤ 5% vs. REL > 5%; and 0.69, 0.85, and 0.87 for REL ≤ 10% vs. REL > 10%.

Among the existing imaging techniques currently available in clinical practice, diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion imaging provide additional information. Recently, with the increasing importance of evaluation of the genomic variation and heterogeneity of tumors, clinical application of imaging techniques using radiomics and deep learning is expected. In this review, we will describe recommendations for magnetic resonance imaging protocols focusing on anatomical images that are still important in the clinical application of brain tumor imaging, and the basic principles of diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion imaging among the advanced imaging techniques, as well as their pathophysiological background and clinical application. Finally, we will review the future perspectives of radiomics and deep learning applications in brain tumor imaging, which have been studied to a great extent due to the development of computer technology.","지은 박,호성 김,지은 박,호성 김",Journal of the Korean Society of Radiology,2020.0
10.1109/icmipe47306.2019.9098212,,,ConvRadiomics: Convolutional Radiomics Feature Extraction Toolkit,"Radiomics is a powerful tool in imaging-based clinical studies and it is gaining importance in oncology due to its ability to extract high-throughput image-based biomarkers in a non-invasive way. However, common methods for extracting radiomics features are mainly designed in the CPU, being an extremely time-consuming process when complicated method verifications or large datasets are involved. In this study, a deep learning-based radiomics sequencer was developed that is capable to extract a total of 93 features, including all histogram and texture based features. Our proposed network exploits the advantage of current CPU-based radiomics feature extraction methods because it has the potential to maintain the interpretability of radiomics features while reducing considerably the computation time of the feature extraction process. To illustrate the effectiveness of the network, we perform the experiments on BRATS17 image dataset obtaining the mean squared error (MSE) of 0.00092 in training, 0.0023 in validation and 0.00197 in test datasets. The feature extraction process was completed in 22.21 seconds, being 7205% faster than conventional CPU-based method. In this way, the potential advantages provided by the proposed network allow radiomics feature extraction process to be faster and more adaptive.","Oihane Mayo Ijurra,Oihane Mayo Ijurra,Yining Jiao,Qian Wang,Yining Jiao,Qian Wang",,2019.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS The records of 214 consecutive patients with SCSNs that were surgically resected and histologically confirmed as lung adenocarcinomas (n=112) and granulomatous lesions (n=102) from 2 medical institutions between October 2011 and June 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients from center 1 ware enrolled as training cohort (n=150) and patients from center 2 were included as external validation cohort (n=64), respectively. Radiomics features were extracted from non-contrast chest CT images preoperatively. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used for radiomics feature extraction and radiomics signature construction. Clinical characteristics, subjective CT findings, and radiomics signature were used to develop a predictive radiomics nomogram. The performance was examined by assessment of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS Lung adenocarcinoma was significantly associated with an irregular margin and lobulated shape in the training set (p=0.001, <0.001) and external validation set (p=0.016, = 0.018), respectively. The radiomics signature consisting of 22 features was significantly associated with lung adenocarcinomas of SCSNs (p<0.001). The radiomics nomogram incorporated the radiomics signature, gender and lobulated shape. The AUCs of combined model in the training and external validation dataset were 0.885 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.823-0.931), 0.808 (95% CI: 0.690-0.896), respectively. Decision curve analysis (DCA) demonstrated that the radiomics nomogram was clinically useful. CONCLUSION A radiomics signature based on non-enhanced CT has the potential to differentiate between lung adenocarcinomas and granulomatous lesions.

10.1109/tmi.2020.3021254,32877335.0,,A Novel Multiresolution-Statistical Texture Analysis Architecture: Radiomics-Aided Diagnosis of PDAC Based on Plain CT Images,"Early screening of PDAC (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) based on plain CT (computed tomogra-phy) images is of great significance. Therefore, this work conducted a radiomics-aided diagnosis analysis of PDAC based on plain CT images. We explored a novel MSTA (multiresolution-statistical texture analysis) architecture to extract texture features and built machine learning models to classify PDACs and HPs (healthy pancreases). We also performed significance tests of differences to analyze the relationships between histopathological characteristics and texture features. The MSTA architecture originates from the analysis of histopathological characteristics and combines multiresolution analysis and statistical analysis to extract texture features. The MSTA architecture achieved better experimental results than the traditional architecture that scales the coefficient matrices of the multiresolution analysis. In the validation of the classifica-tions, the MSTA architecture achieved an accuracy of 81.19% and an AUC (area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve) of 0.88 (95% confidence interval: 0.84-0.92). In the test of the classifications, it achieved an accuracy of 77.66% and an AUC of 0.79 (95% confidence interval: 0.71-0.87). Moreover, the significance tests of differences showed that the extracted texture features may be relevant to the histopathological characteristics. The MSTA architecture is beneficial for the radiomics-aided diagnosis of PDAC based on plain CT images. Its texture features can potentially enhance radiologists' imaging interpretation abilities.","Jiajun Qiu,Jia-Jun Qiu,Jia-Jun Qiu,Jia-Jun Qiu,Jia-Jun Qiu,Yixin Jin,Jin Yin,Wei Qian,Jin Yin,Wei Qian,Jin-Heng Liu,Jin-Heng Liu,Zixing Huang,Zixing Huang,Zi-Xing Huang,Haopeng Yu,Li Ji,Hao-Peng Yu,Xiaoxi Zeng,Lin Ji,Lin Ji,Xiao-Xi Zeng,Xiaoxi Zeng,Xiao-Xi Zeng",IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,2020.0
10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-20-1264,32727886.0,,A Radiomics Model for Predicting the Response to Bevacizumab in Brain Necrosis after Radiotherapy.,"Purpose: Bevacizumab is considered a promising therapy for brain necrosis after radiotherapy, while some patients fail to derive benefit or even worsen. Hence, we developed and validated a radiomics model for predicting the response to bevacizumab in patients with brain necrosis after radiotherapy. Methods: A total of 149 patients (with 194 brain lesions; 101, 51 and 42 in the training, internal and external validation sets, respectively) receiving bevacizumab were enrolled. In total, 1301 radiomic features were extracted from the pre-treatment MRI images of each lesion. In the training set, a radiomics signature was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was then used to develop a radiomics model incorporated the radiomics signature and independent clinical predictors. The performance of the model was assessed by its discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness with internal and external validation. Results: The radiomics signature consisted of 18 selected features and showed good discrimination performance. The model, which integrates the radiomics signature, the interval between radiotherapy and diagnosis of brain necrosis, and the interval between diagnosis of brain necrosis and treatment with bevacizumab, showed favorable calibration and discrimination in the training set (AUC 0.916). These findings were confirmed in the validation sets (AUC 0.912 and 0.827, respectively). Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of the model. Conclusions: The presented radiomics model, available as an online calculator, can serve as a user-friendly tool for individualized prediction of the response to bevacizumab in patients with brain necrosis after radiotherapy.","Jinhua Cai,Jinhua Cai,Junjiong Zheng,Junjiong Zheng,Jun Shen,Junjiong Zheng,Jun Shen,Jun Shen,Zhiyong Yuan,Mingwei Xie,Zhiyong Yuan,Mingwei Xie,Min Gao,Hongqi Tan,Miaomiao Gao,Hongqi Tan,Zhong‐Guo Liang,Xiaoming Rong,Zhong-Guo Liang,Yi Li,Xiaoming Rong,Honghong Li,Yi Li,Jingru Jiang,Honghong Li,Huiying Zhao,Jingru Jiang,Haralabos P.

This retrospective study included 157 consecutive patients (training sets, 109 patients; test sets, 48 patients) with acute STEMI undergoing PCI. An open-source radiomics software was used to segment the myocardium on the non-contrast T1 mapping and extract features. A radiomic signature was constructed to predict MACEs using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method. The performance of the radiomic nomogram for predicting MACEs in both the training and test sets was evaluated by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. The radiomic signature showed a good prognostic ability in the training sets with an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.86 to 1.00) and F1 score of 0.71, which was confirmed in the test sets with an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.74 to 1.00) and F1 score of 0.62.

The non-contrast T1 map–based radiomic nomogram is a useful tool for the prediction of MACEs in patients with acute STEMI undergoing PCI that can assist clinicians for optimised risk stratification of individual patients.                 • Radiomic signature improved MACE prediction in acute STEMI patients. • T1 mapping–derived radiomic signature outperformed conventional cardiac MRI parameters in predicting MACEs in acute STEMI patients. • The non-contrast T1 mapping–based radiomic nomogram can be used for prediction of MACEs and improvement of risk stratification in acute STEMI.","Quanmei Ma,Yue Ma,Quanmei Ma,Yue Ma,Xiaonan Wang,Shanshan Li,Xiaonan Wang,Yasuyuki Takata,Shanshan Li,Weili Duan,Tongtong Yu,Weili Duan,Jiake Wu,Zongyu Wen,Jiake Wu,Zongyu Wen,Yundi Jiao,Zhaoqing Sun,Yundi Jiao,Zhaoqing Sun,Yang Hou,Yang Hou",European Radiology,2020.0
10.1007/s00330-020-07221-w,32876837.0,,A systematic review of radiomics in osteosarcoma: utilizing radiomics quality score as a tool promoting clinical translation,"OBJECTIVES To assess the methodological quality and risk of bias in radiomics studies investigating diagnosis, therapy response, and survival of patients with osteosarcoma. METHODS In this systematic review, literatures on radiomics in osteosarcoma were included and assessed for methodological quality through the radiomics quality score (RQS). The risk of bias and concern of application was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. A meta-analysis of studies focusing on predicting osteosarcoma response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was performed. RESULTS Twelve radiomics studies exploring osteosarcoma were identified, and five were included in meta-analysis. The RQS reached an average of 20.4% (6.92 of 36) with good inter-rater agreement (ICC 0.95, 95% CI 0.85-0.99). Four studies validated results with an internal dataset, none of which used external dataset; one study was prospectively designed, and another one shared part of the dataset. The risk of bias and concern of application were mainly related to index test aspect. The meta-analysis showed a diagnostic odds ratio of 43.68 (95%CI 13.5-141.31) for predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with high heterogeneity and low methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS The overall scientific quality of included studies is insufficient; however, radiomics remains a promising technology for predicting treatment response, which might guide therapeutic decision-making and related to prognosis. Improvements in study design, validation, and open science needs to be made to demonstrate the generalizability of findings and to achieve clinical applications. Widespread application of RQS, pre-trained RQS scoring procedure, and modification of RQS in response to clinical needs are necessary. KEY POINTS • Limited radiomics studies were established in osteosarcoma with mean RQS of 20.4%, commonly due to unvalidated results, retrospective study design, and absence of open science. • Meta-analysis of radiomics studies predicting osteosarcoma response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed high diagnostic odds ratio 43.68, while high heterogeneity and low methodological quality were the main concerns. • A previously trained data extraction instrument allowed reaching moderate inter-rater agreement in RQS applications, while RQS still needs improvement to become a wide adaptive tool in reviews of radiomics studies, in routine self-check before manuscript submitting and in study design.","Jingyu Zhong,Yangfan Hu,Jingyu Zhong,Lin Si,Yangfan Hu,Liping Si,Jia Geng,Yue Xing,Geng Jia,Huan Zhang,Yue Xing,Huan Zhang,Huan Zhang,Weiwu Yao,Weiwu Yao,Weiwu Yao",European Radiology,2020.0

PURPOSE To build and validate a radiomic nomogram for preoperative discrimination between malignant and benign sinonasal tumors. STUDY TYPE Retrospective. POPULATION In all, 197 patients with histopathologically confirmed 84 benign and 113 malignant sinonasal tumors. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCES Fast-spin-echo (FSE) T1 -weighted and fat-suppressed FSE T2 -weighted imaging on a 1.5T and 3.0T MRI. ASSESSMENT T1 and fat-suppressed T2 -weighted images were selected for feature extraction. The least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was applied to establish a radiomic score. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to determine independent risk factors, and the radiomic score was combined to build a radiomic nomogram. The nomogram was assessed in a training dataset (n = 138/3.0T MRI) and tested in a validation dataset (n = 59/1.5T MRI). STATISTICAL TESTS Independent t-test or Wilcoxon's test, chi-square-test, or Fisher's-test, univariate analysis, LASSO, multivariate logistic regression analysis, area under the curve (AUC), Hosmer-Lemeshow test, decision curve, and the Delong test. RESULTS In the validation dataset, the radiomic nomogram could differentiate benign from malignant sinonasal tumors with an AUC of 0.91. There was no significant difference in AUC between the combined radiomic score and radiomic nomogram (P>0.05), and the radiomic nomogram showed a relatively higher AUC than the combined radiomic score. There was a significant difference in AUC between each two of the following models (the radiomic nomogram vs. the clinical model, all P<0.001; the combined radiomic score vs. the clinical model, P = 0.0252 and 0.0035, respectively, in the training and validation datasets). The radiomic nomogram outperformed the radiomic scores and clinical model.

Patients and Methods: The prediction model was developed in 609 patients with clinicopathologically confirmed unifocal PTC who received ultrasonography between Jan 2018 and June 2018. Radiomic features were extracted after the ultrasonography of PTC. Lasso regression model was used for data dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and radiomics signature building. The predicting model was established based on the multivariable logistic regression analysis in which the radiomics signature, ultrasonography-reported LN status, and independent clinicopathologic risk factors were incorporated, and finally a radiomics nomogram was established. The performance of the nomogram was assessed with respect to the discrimination and consistence. An independent validation was performed in 326 consecutive patients from July 2018 to Sep 2018. Results: The radiomics signature consisted of 23 selected features and was significantly associated with LN status in both primary and validation cohorts. The independent predictors in the radiomics nomogram included the radiomics signature, age, TG level, TPOAB level and ultrasonography-reported LN status. The model showed good discrimination and consistence in both cohorts: C-index of 0.816 (95% CI, 0.808 to 0.824) in the primary cohort and 0.858 (95% CI, 0.849 to 0.867) in the validation cohort. The area under receiver operating curve was 0.858.

Materials and methods: One hundred and eighty-two patients with histopathologically confirmed rectal cancer and preoperative magnetic resonance imaging were retrospectively analyzed, who were divided into high (N1-2) and low N stage (N0). Texture features were calculated from histogram, gray-level co-occurrence matrix, and gray-level run-length matrix from sagittal fat-suppression and oblique axial T2WI. Independent sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to build the predictive models. Predictive performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: Energy (ENE), entropy (ENT), information correlation (INC), long-run emphasis (LRE), and short-run low gray-level emphasis (SRLGLE) extracted from sagittal fat-suppression T2WI, and ENE, ENT, INC, low gray-level run emphasis (LGLRE), and SRLGLE from oblique axial T2WI were significantly different between stage N0 and stage N1-2 tumors. The multivariate analysis for features from sagittal fat-suppression T2WI showed that higher SRLGLE and lower ENE were independent predictors of lymph node invasion. The model reached an area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.759. The analysis for features from oblique axial T2WI showed that higher INC and SRLGLE were independent predictors. The model achieved an AUC of 0.747. The analysis for all extracted features showed that lower ENE from sagittal fat-suppression T2WI and higher INC and SRLGLE from oblique axial T2WI were independent predictors. The model showed an AUC of 0.772. Conclusions: Texture features derived from T2WI could provide valuable information for identifying the status of lymph node invasion in rectal cancer.","Lirong Song,Jiandong Yin,Lirong Song,Jiandong Yin",Frontiers in Oncology,2020.0

Artificial intelligence has demonstrated value in prognostic biomarker discovery in lung cancer diagnosis, treatment, and response assessment, putting it at the forefront of the next phase of personalized medicine. However, although exploratory studies demonstrate potential utility, there is a need for rigorous validation and standardization before AI can be utilized in clinical decision-making.

METHODS This retrospective study included 66 patients with HNSCC primary lesions (36 oropharyngeal, 6 hypopharyngeal, 10 laryngeal, 14 oral cavity). Gene expression information for 6 targetable genes (fibroblast growth factor receptor [FGFR]1, epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], FGFR2, FGFR3, EPHA2, PIK3CA) was obtained via Agilent microarrays from samples collected between 1997 and 2010. Pretreatment contrast-enhanced soft tissue neck CT scans were reviewed, and 142 radiomics features were derived. R was used to calculate Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between gene expression levels and each radiomic feature. P values were adjusted using the false discovery rate (FDR) method. RESULTS There were significant correlations between FGFR1 and 5 gray level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) features with FDR-adjusted P values less than 0.05: inertia (r = 0.366, FDR-adjusted P = 0.006), absolute value (r = 0.31, FDR-adjusted P = 0.024), contrast (r = 0.366, FDR-adjusted P = 0.006), difference average (r = 0.31, FDR-adjusted P = 0.024), and difference variance (r = 0.37, FDR-adjusted P = 0.005). There was 1 correlated feature for FGFR2 with an FDR-adjusted P value less than 0.05: fractal dimension box-coarse (r = 0.33, FDR-adjusted P = 0.018). There was 1 correlated feature for EPHA2 with an FDR-adjusted P value less than 0.05: GLCM entropy (r = -0.28, FDR-adjusted P = 0.049). Six of the 7 features that showed significant correlation belonged to the GLCM class of features.

A cancer diagnosis is complicated, and treatment outcomes vary from patient to patient. Improving cancer diagnosis may help in early diagnosis and reduces early deaths. The most common method for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancer is gastroscopic imaging. The availability of white light, non-magnifying images, and manual pathological examination are the major drawbacks of the system. Imaging methods like X-Ray, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Nuclear Medicine (NM) Positron Emission Tomography (PET), and Ultrasound (US) had revolutionized the diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancer. The disadvantage with these radiological images is that they contain more information and content, which is not visible to the clinician’s eye. Radiomics is a process of conversion of digital medical images into mineable high-dimensional data. In this chapter, the use of big data in radiomics as a tool for gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis and prognosis is discussed.

Here, we investigate the stratification potential of CT-radiomics in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients and test if CT-radiomics is a surrogate predictor for hypoxia as identified by PET.    Materials and methods  Two independent cohorts of HNC patients were used for model development and validation, HN1 (n=149) and HN2 (n=47). The training set HN1 consisted of native planning CT data whereas for the validation cohort HN2 also hypoxia PET/CT data was acquired using [18F]-Fluoromisonidazole (FMISO). Machine learning algorithms including feature engineering and classifier selection were trained for two-year loco-regional control (LRC) to create optimal CT-radiomics signatures.  Secondly, a pre-defined [18F]FMISO-PET tumour-to-muscle-ratio (TMRpeak≥1.6) was used for LRC prediction. Comparison between risk groups identified by CT-radiomics or [18F]FMISO-PET was performed using area-under–the-curve (AUC) and Kaplan-Meier analysis including log-rank test.    Results  The best performing CT-radiomics signature included two features with nearest-neighbour classification (AUC=0.76±0.09), whereas AUC was 0.59 for external validation. In contrast, [18F]FMISO TMRpeak reached an AUC of 0.66 in HN2. Kaplan-Meier analysis of the independent validation cohort HN2 did not confirm the prognostic value of CT-radiomics (p=0.18), whereas for [18F]FMISO-PET significant differences were observed (p=0.02).    Conclusions  No direct correlation of patient stratification using [18F]FMISO-PET or CT-radiomics was found in this study. Risk groups identified by CT-radiomics or hypoxia PET showed only poor overlap. Direct assessment of tumour hypoxia using PET seems to be more powerful to stratify HNC patients.","Jairo A Socarrás Fernández,David Mönnich,Jairo Socarras Fernandez,Sara Leibfarth,David Mönnich,Stefan Welz,Sara Leibfarth,Alex Zwanenburg,Stefan Welz,Stefan Leger,Alex Zwanenburg,Steffen Löck,Stefan Leger,Steffen Löck,Christina Pfannenberg,Christina Pfannenberg,Christian la Fougère,Gerald Reischl,Christian la Fougère,Michael H.

From the data, logistic-regression models were learned for establishing tumor stage, Gleason score, level of prostate-specific antigen, and risk stratification, and for predicting biochemical recurrence. Performance of the learned models was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) or the area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PRC). RESULTS Results suggest that the histogram-based Energy and Kurtosis features and the shape-based feature representing the standard deviation of the maximum diameter of the prostate gland during treatment are predictive of biochemical relapse and indicative of patients at high risk. CONCLUSION Our results suggest the usefulness of CBCT-based radiomics for treatment definition in prostate cancer.","Davide Bosetti,D.

10.3389/fonc.2020.01621,,,Deep Learning-Based Radiomics of B-Mode Ultrasonography and Shear-Wave Elastography: Improved Performance in Breast Mass Classification,"Objective: Shear-wave elastography (SWE) can improve the diagnostic specificity of the B-model ultrasonography (US) in breast cancer. However, whether deep learning-based radiomics signatures based on the B-mode US (B-US-RS) or SWE (SWE-RS) could further improve the diagnostic performance remains to be investigated. We aim to develop the B-US-RS and SWE-RS and determine their performances in classifying breast masses. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 263 women (mean age ± standard deviation, 40.9 years ± 12.3) who had US-visible solid breast masses and underwent biopsy or/and surgical resection between June 2015 and May 2017. B-mode US and SWE images of the masses in 198 patients (training cohort) were segmented respectively to construct B-US-RS and SWE-RS using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and tested in an independent validation cohort of 65 patients. The performances of B-US-RS and SWE-RS were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and compared with that of radiologist assessment (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS]) and quantitative SWE parameters (E max , E mean , E ratio , and E SD ) by using the McNemar test.The single best-performing quantitative SWE parameter E max had a higher specificity than BI-RADS assessment in these two cohorts (P < 0.001 for both). The areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) of B-US-RS and SWE-RS both were 0.99 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.00) in the training cohort and 1.00 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.00) in the validation cohort. The specificities of B-US-RS and SWE-RS were higher than that of E max in training (P < 0.001 for both) and validation cohorts (P = 0.02 for both).The B-US-RS and SWE-RS outperformed the quantitative SWE parameters and BI-RADS assessment for classifying breast masses. The integration of the deep learning-based radiomics approach would help improve the classification ability of B-mode US and SWE for breast masses.","Xiang Zhang,Xiang Zhang,Liang Ming,Ming Liang,Zehong Yang,Chushan Zheng,Zehong Yang,Jiayi Wu,Chushan Zheng,Jiayi Wu,Bing Ou,Haojiang Li,Bing Ou,Bing Ou,Xiaoyan Wu,Haojiang Li,Baoming Luo,Xiaoyan Wu,Baoming Luo,Jun Shen,Baoming Luo,Jun Shen,Jun Shen",Frontiers in Oncology,2020.0

The aim of this study is to develop and validate a predictive model to estimate recurrence-free survival (RFS) in those patients who achieved pCR. Materials and methods: Two hundred six patients with ESCC were enrolled and divided into a training cohort (n=146) and a validation cohort (n=60). Radiomic features were extracted from contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images of each patient. Feature reduction was then implemented in two steps, including a multiple segmentation test and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox proportional hazards regression method. A radiomics signature was subsequently constructed and evaluated. For better prediction performance, a clinical nomogram based on clinical risk factors and a nomogram incorporating the radiomics signature and clinical risk factors was built. Finally, the prediction models were further validated by calibration and the clinical usefulness was examined in the validation cohort to determine the optimal prediction model. Results: The radiomics signature was constructed using eight radiomic features and displayed a significant correlation with RFS. The nomogram incorporating the radiomics signature with clinical risk factors achieved optimal performance compared with the radiomics signature (P<0.001) and clinical nomogram (P<0.001) in both the training cohort [C-index (95% confidence interval [CI]), 0.746 (0.680-0.812) vs. 0.685 (0.620-0.750) vs. 0.614 (0.538-0.690), respectively] and validation cohort [C-index (95% CI), 0.724 (0.696-0.752) vs. 0.671 (0.624-0.718) vs. 0.629 (0.597-0.661), respectively]. The calibration curve and decision curve analysis revealed that the radiomics nomogram outperformed the other two models. Conclusions: A radiomics nomogram model incorporating radiomics features and clinical factors has been developed and has the improved ability to predict the postoperative recurrence risk in patients with ESCC who achieved pCR after nCRT followed by surgery.","Qingtao Qiu,Qingtao Qiu,Jinghao Duan,Jinghao Duan,Hongkui Deng,Hongbin Deng,Zhujun Han,Zhujun Han,Jinyan Gu,Jiabing Gu,Ning J.

10.3389/fonc.2020.01161,32903606.0,,Immunohistochemistry and Radiomic Features for Survival Prediction in Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Background Aim of the study was to evaluate the role of different immunohistochemical and radiomics features in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Methods Consecutive patients with histologically proven SCLC, with limited n=47 (48%) or extensive disease n=51 (52%), treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy at our department, were included in the analysis. The expression of different immunohistochemical markers from the initial tissue biopsy such as CD56, CD44, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, TTF-1, GLUT-1, Hif-1 a, PD-1 and PD-L1 and MIB-1/KI-67 as well as the LDH und NSE from the initial blood sample were evaluated. H-Scores were additionally generated for CD44, Hif-1a and GLUT-1. A total of 72 computer tomography (CT) radiomics texture features, from a homogenous subgroup (n=31) of patients, were correlated with the immunohistochemistry, the survival (OS) and the progression free survival (PFS) Results The median OS, calculated from diagnosis, was 21 months for patients with limited disease and 13 months for patients with extensive disease. The expression of synaptophysin correlated with a better OS (HR 0.546 95% CI 0.308-0.966, p=0.03). The expression of TTF-1(HR 0.286, 95% CI: 0.117-0.698, p=0.006) and a lower GLUT-1 H-score (median = 50, HR: 0.511, 95% CI: 0.260-1.003, p=0.05) correlated with a better PFS. Patients without chromogranin A expression had a higher incidence for cerebral metastases (p=0.02) and patients with PD 1 expression had a higher incidence of distant metastases (p=0.02) at diagnosis. Our radiomics analysis did not reveal a single texture feature that correlated highly with OS or PFS. Correlation coefficients ranged between -0.48 and 0.39 for OS and between -0.46 and 0.38 for PFS. Conclusions The role of synaptophysin should be further evaluated, as synaptophysin-negative patients might profit from treatment intensification. We report an at most moderate correlation of radiomics features with overall and progression free survival and no correlation with the expression of different immunohistochemical markers.","Eleni Gkika,Eleni Gkika,Matthias Benndorf,Matthias Benndorf,Benedict Oerther,Benedict Oerther,Farid Mohammad,Farid Mohammad,S.

10.1109/access.2020.3008927,,,Impact of Image Contrast Enhancement on Stability of Radiomics Feature Quantification on a 2D Mammogram Radiograph,"The present work aimed to evaluate the reproducibility of radiomics features derived from manual delineation and semiautomatic segmentation after enhancement using the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE) techniques on a benign tumor of two-dimensional (2D) mammography images. Thirty mammogram images with known benign tumors were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) datasets and were randomly selected as subjects. The samples were enhanced for semiautomatic segmentation sets using the Active Contour Model in MATLAB 2019a before analysis by two independent observers. Meanwhile, the images without any enhancement were segmented manually. The samples were divided into three categories: (1) CLAHE images, (2) AHE images, and (3) manual segmented images. Radiomics features were extracted using algorithms provided by MATLAB 2019a software and were assessed with a reliable intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) score. Radiomics features for the CLAHE group (ICC = 0.890 ± 0.554, p   0.05). Features in all three categories were more robust for the CLAHE compared to the AHE and manual groups. This study shows the existence in variation for the radiomics features extracted from tumor region that are segmented using various image enhancement techniques. Semiautomatic segmentation with image enhancement using CLAHE algorithm gave the best result and was a better alternative than manual delineation as the first two techniques yielded reproducible descriptors. This method should be applicable for predicting outcomes in patient with breast cancer.","Siti Fairuz Mat Radzi,Siti Fairuz Mat Radzi,Muhammad Khalis Abdul Karim,Siti Fairuz Mat Radzi,M.

10.1186/s13244-020-00895-2,32804260.0,,Integrative radiogenomics for virtual biopsy and treatment monitoring in ovarian cancer.,"BACKGROUND Ovarian cancer survival rates have not changed in the last 20years. The majority of cases are High-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs), which are typically diagnosed at an advanced stage with multiple metastatic lesions. Taking biopsies of all sites of disease is infeasible, which challenges the implementation of stratification tools based on molecular profiling. MAIN BODY In this review, we describe how these challenges might be overcome by integrating quantitative features extracted from medical imaging with the analysis of paired genomic profiles, a combined approach called radiogenomics, to generate virtual biopsies. Radiomic studies have been used to model different imaging phenotypes, and some radiomic signatures have been associated with paired molecular profiles to monitor spatiotemporal changes in the heterogeneity of tumours. We describe different strategies to integrate radiogenomic information in a global and local manner, the latter by targeted sampling of tumour habitats, defined as regions with distinct radiomic phenotypes. CONCLUSION Linking radiomics and biological correlates in a targeted manner could potentially improve the clinical management of ovarian cancer. Radiogenomic signatures could be used to monitor tumours during the course of therapy, offering additional information for clinical decision making. In summary, radiogenomics may pave the way to virtual biopsies and treatment monitoring tools for integrative tumour analysis.","Paula Martin-Gonzalez,Paula Martin-Gonzalez,Mireia Crispín-Ortuzar,Mireia Crispin-Ortuzar,Leonardo Rundo,Maria Delgado-Ortet,Leonardo Rundo,Maria Delgado-Ortet,Marika Reinius,Lucian Beer,Marika Reinius,Lucian Beer,Ramona Woitek,Ramona Woitek,Stephan Ursprung,Stephan Ursprung,Helen Addley,Helen Addley,James D.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. METHODS Pretreatment MRI data from 62 consecutive patients with oropharyngeal SCC were retrospectively reviewed, and chronologically allocated to training (n = 43) and test sets (n = 19). Enhancing tumors were semi-automatically segmented on each slice of the postcontrast T1WI to span the entire tumor volume, after registration of T2WI to postcontrast T1WI; 170 radiomic features were extracted from the entire tumor volume. Relevant features were selected and radiomics models were trained using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression model with 10-fold cross-validation, after subsampling of training sets using synthetic minority over-sampling technique to mitigate data imbalance. The selected features, weighted by their respective coefficients, were combined linearly to yield a radiomics score. The diagnostic performance of the radiomic score was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS Six radiomic features, which revealed strong association with HPV status of oropharyngeal SCC, were selected using LASSO. The radiomics model yielded excellent performance on the training set (AUC, 0.982 [95% CI, 0.942-1.000]) and moderate performance on the test set (AUC, 0.744 [95% CI, 0.496-0.991]) for differentiating oropharyngeal SCC according to HPV status.

Methods: This retrospective study consisted of 142 patients with breast cancer who underwent MRI before NACT, of which 35 patients experienced pathological complete response (pCR) by the postoperative pathological examination. The patients were randomly divided into the training (n=99) and test sets (n=43). The features were selected by the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) and absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm in the training set, which was used to establish the radiomics signature by machine learning. The predictive score of each patient was calculated using the radiomics signature formula. Finally, combined with clinical factors, the predictive model was constructed using multivariate logistic regression, resulting in the creation of the nomogram. The diagnostic accuracy of the nomogram was evaluated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and was validated using the test set. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to validate the clinical practicability of the nomogram. Results: The radiomics signature was well-discriminated in the training set [AUC 0.854, specificity 72%, sensitivity 95.83%], and test set (AUC 0.844, specificity 71.87%, sensitivity 90.91%). The radiomics nomogram, which incorporated the radiomics signature and hormone status, also showed excellent calibration and discrimination in the training set [AUC 0.892, specificity 88.00%, sensitivity 89.17%], and test set (AUC 0.881, specificity 81.25%, sensitivity 86.82%). The decision curve indicated the clinical usefulness of our nomogram. Conclusion: Our radiomics nomogram showed excellent recognition ability for breast cancer patients with pCR after undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The model may be used to predict the treatment response of individual breast cancer patients in the future.","Shujun Chen,Shujun Chen,Zhenyu Shu,Zhenyu Shu,Yongfeng Li,Yongfeng Li,Bin Chen,Lan Tang,Bo Chen,Wenju Mo,Lirong Tang,Guoliang Shao,Wenju Mo,Guoliang Shao,Feng Shao,Feng Shao",Frontiers in Oncology,2020.0
10.3748/wjg.v26.i32.4729,,,New advances in radiomics of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are uncommon neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract with peculiar clinical, genetic, and imaging characteristics. Preoperative knowledge of risk stratification and mutational status is crucial to guide the appropriate patients' treatment. Predicting the clinical behavior and biological aggressiveness of GISTs based on conventional computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation is challenging, unless the lesions have already metastasized at the time of diagnosis. Radiomics is emerging as a promising tool for the quantification of lesion heterogeneity on radiological images, extracting additional data that cannot be assessed by visual analysis. Radiomics applications have been explored for the differential diagnosis of GISTs from other gastrointestinal neoplasms, risk stratification and prediction of prognosis after surgical resection, and evaluation of mutational status in GISTs. The published researches on GISTs radiomics have obtained excellent performance of derived radiomics models on CT and MRI. However, lack of standardization and differences in study methodology challenge the application of radiomics in clinical practice. The purpose of this review is to describe the new advances of radiomics applied to CT and MRI for the evaluation of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, discuss the potential clinical applications that may impact patients' management, report limitations of current radiomics studies, and future directions.","Roberto Cannella,Ludovico La Grutta,Roberto Cannella,Ludovico La Grutta,Massimo Midiri,Massimo Midiri,Tommaso Vincenzo Bartolotta,Tommaso Vincenzo Bartolotta",World Journal of Gastroenterology,2020.0

METHODS Between August 2016 and November 2018, a total of 343 patients with histologically proven malignant breast tumors were included in this study and randomly assigned to the training and validation groups at a ratio of 7:3. ALN tumor burden was defined as low (<3 metastatic ALNs) or high (≥3 metastatic ALNs). Radiomics features were obtained using the PyRadiomics package, and the radiomics score was established by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. A nomogram combining the breast cancer US radiomics score with patient age and lesion size was generated based on the multivariate logistic regression results. RESULTS In the training and validation cohorts, 29.1% (69/237) and 32.08% (34/106) of patients were pathologically diagnosed with more than 2 metastatic ALNs, respectively. The radiomics score consisted of 16 US features, and patient age and lesion diameter identified by US were included to construct the model. The AUC of the model was 0.846 (95% CI, 0.790-0.902) for the training cohort and 0.733 (95% CI, 0.613-0.852) for the validation cohort. The calibration curves showed good agreement between the predictions and observations. CONCLUSIONS Our novel nomogram demonstrates high accuracy in predicting ALN tumor burden in breast cancer patients. We also suggest further development of PyRadiomics to improve US radiomics.

10.1038/s41598-020-69816-z,32782415.0,,On the correlation between second order texture features and human observer detection performance in digital images.,"Image texture, the relative spatial arrangement of intensity values in an image, encodes valuable information about the scene. As it stands, much of this potential information remains untapped. Understanding how to decipher textural details would afford another method of extracting knowledge of the physical world from images. In this work, we attempt to bridge the gap in research between quantitative texture analysis and the visual perception of textures. The impact of changes in image texture on human observer’s ability to perform signal detection and localization tasks in complex digital images is not understood. We examine this critical question by studying task-based human observer performance in detecting and localizing signals in tomographic breast images. We have also investigated how these changes impact the formation of second-order image texture. We used digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) an FDA approved tomographic X-ray breast imaging method as the modality of choice to show our preliminary results. Our human observer studies involve localization ROC (LROC) studies for low contrast mass detection in DBT. Simulated images are used as they offer the benefit of known ground truth. Our results prove that changes in system geometry or processing leads to changes in image texture magnitudes. We show that the variations in several well-known texture features estimated in digital images correlate with human observer detection–localization performance for signals embedded in them. This insight can allow efficient and practical techniques to identify the best imaging system design and algorithms or filtering tools by examining the changes in these texture features. This concept linking texture feature estimates and task based image quality assessment can be extended to several other imaging modalities and applications as well. It can also offer feedback in system and algorithm designs with a goal to improve perceptual benefits. Broader impact can be in wide array of areas including imaging system design, image processing, data science, machine learning, computer vision, perceptual and vision science. Our results also point to the caution that must be exercised in using these texture features as image-based radiomic features or as predictive markers for risk assessment as they are sensitive to system or imageprocessing changes.","William H.

Adjuvant chemotherapy is usually used for distant control. However, not all patients can benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, and particularly, some patients may even get worse outcomes after the treatment. We develop and validate an MRI-based radiomic signature (RS) for prediction of DM within a multicenter dataset. The RS is proved to be an independent prognostic factor as it not only demonstrates good accuracy for discriminating patients into high and lowrisk of DM in all the four cohorts, but also outperforms clinical models. Within the stratified analysis, good chemotherapy efficacy is observed for patients with pN2 disease and low RS, whereas poor chemotherapy efficacy is detected in patients with pT1–2 or pN0 disease and high RS. The RS may help individualized treatment planning to select patients who may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy for distant control.

10.3390/app10186296,,,Prediction of Glioma Grades Using Deep Learning with Wavelet Radiomic Features,"Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors. They are classified into 4 grades (Grade I–II-III–IV) according to the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO). The accurate grading of gliomas has clinical significance for planning prognostic treatments, pre-diagnosis, monitoring and administration of chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to develop a deep learning-based classification method using radiomic features of brain tumor glioma grades with deep neural network (DNN). The classifier was combined with the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) the powerful feature extraction tool. This study primarily focuses on the four main aspects of the radiomic workflow, namely tumor segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, and classification. We evaluated data from 121 patients with brain tumors (Grade II, n = 77; Grade III, n = 44) from The Cancer Imaging Archive, and 744 radiomic features were obtained by applying low sub-band and high sub-band 3D wavelet transform filters to the 3D tumor images. Quantitative values were statistically analyzed with MannWhitney U tests and 126 radiomic features with significant statistical properties were selected in eight different wavelet filters. Classification performances of 3D wavelet transform filter groups were measured using accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, and specificity values using the deep learning classifier model. The proposed model was highly effective in grading gliomas with 96.15% accuracy, 94.12% precision, 100% recall, 96.97% F1 score, and 98.75% Area under the ROC curve. As a result, deep learning and feature selection techniques with wavelet transform filters can be accurately applied using the proposed method in glioma grade classification.","Gökalp Çınarer,Bülent Gürsel Emiroğlu,Gokalp Cinarer,Ahmet Haşim Yurttakal,Bulent Gursel Emiroglu,Ahmet Haşim Yurttakal",Applied Sciences,2020.0

METHODS Between 2012 and 2018, 103 retrospectively (training cohort) and 71 consecutively included patients (validation cohort) underwent 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging. The 434 extracted radiomic features were subjected, after redundancy filtering, to a projection resulting in outcome-independent meta-features (factors). Correlations between clinical, first-order 18F-FDG-PET parameters (e.g., SUVmean), and factors were assessed. Factors were combined with 18F-FDG-PET and clinical parameters in a multivariable survival regression and validated. A clinically applicable risk-stratification was constructed for patients' outcome. RESULTS Based on 124 retained radiomic features from 103 patients, 8 factors were constructed. Recurrence prediction was significantly most accurate by combining HPV-status, SUVmean, SUVpeak, factor 3 (histogram gradient and long-run-low-grey-level-emphasis), factor 4 (volume-difference, coarseness, and grey-level-non-uniformity), and factor 6 (histogram variation coefficient) (CI = 0.645). Distant metastasis prediction was most accurate assessing metabolic-active tumor volume (MATV)(CI = 0.627). Overall survival prediction was most accurate using HPV-status, SUVmean, SUVmax, factor 1 (least-axis-length, non-uniformity, high-dependence-of-high grey-levels), and factor 5 (aspherity, major-axis-length, inversed-compactness and, inversed-flatness) (CI = 0.764). CONCLUSIONS Combining HPV-status, first-order 18F-FDG-PET parameters, and complementary radiomic factors was most accurate for time-to-event prediction. Predictive phenotype-specific tumor characteristics and interactions might be captured and retained using radiomic factors, which allows for personalized risk stratification and optimizing personalized cancer care.

We developed machine learning models for diagnosis of PNI and KRAS mutation in colon cancer patients by interpreting preoperative CT. This retrospective study included 207 patients who received surgical resection in our institution. The underlying tumor characteristics were described by analyzing CT image texture quantitatively. The key radiomics features were determined with similarity analysis followed by RELIEFF method among 306 CT imaging features. Eight kernel-based support vector machines classifiers were constructed using individual (II, III, or IV) or multi-stage (II+III+IV) patient cohorts for predicting PNI and KRAS mutation. The model performances were evaluated using accuracy, receiver operating curve, and decision curve analyses. Multi-stage classifiers obtained AUC of 0.793 and 0.862 for detecting PNI and KRAS mutation for test cohort. Moreover, individual-stage classifiers demonstrated significantly improved diagnostic performance at all stages (IIAUC: [0.86; 0.99], IIIAUC: [0.99; 0.99], and IVAUC: [1.00; 1.00], respectively, for PNI and KRAS mutation in test cohort). Besides, stage II tumor is better described with coarse texture features while more detailed features are required for better characterization of advanced-stage tumors (III and IV) for diagnoses of PNI or KRAS mutation. Machine learning models developed using preoperative CT data can predict PNI and KRAS mutation in colon cancer patients with satisfactory performance. Individual-stage models better-characterized the relationship between CT features and PNI or KRAS mutation than multi-stage models and demonstrated good prediction scores.","Yu Li,Yu Li,Aydın Eresen,Yu Li,Yu Li,Junjie Shangguan,Aydin Eresen,Junjie Shangguan,Jia Yang,Jia Yang,Al B.

All patients accepted CECT within ten days before biopsy or surgery resection. Radiomic features based on venous phase CECT were generated automatically from Artificial-Intelligence Kit (AK) software. All lymph nodes were randomly divided into the training set (n= 54) and testing set (n= 23) in a ratio of 7:3. ANOVA+ Mann-Whiney, Spearman Correlation, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and Gradient Descent (GBDT) were introduced for the reduction of the highly redundant features. Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) model was constructed based on the selected features. ROC was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the features and model. Finally, a nomogram was established for model application. Results: Seven features were screened out at the end, significant difference was found between the two groups for all the features with area under the curves (AUCs) ranged from 0.759 to 0.915. The AUC of the model's identification performance was 0.970 in the training group and 0.977 in the testing group. The disease discrimination efficiency of the model was better than that of any single feature. Conclusions: The radiomic features and the model based on these features on venous phase CECT images had very good performance for the discrimination between Kimura disease and lymph node metastases in the head and neck.","Ying Zhang,Sheng-Bo Yu,Ying Zhang,Li Zhang,Shujing Yu,Lillian Kang,Li Zhang,Li Zhang,Liqing Kang",Frontiers in Oncology,2020.0

Methods: We collected CT images of pathological T4 gastric cancer in 955 consecutive patients of two cancer centers for analyzing the radiomics features retrospectively and then developed and validated the prediction model built from 292 quantitative image features in the training cohort and two validation cohorts. Lasso regression model was applied for selecting feature and constructing radiomics signature. Predicting model was developed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Radiomics nomogram was developed by the incorporation of radiomics signature, clinical T and N stage. Calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness were used to evaluate the performance of the nomogram. Results: In training and validation cohorts, PM status was associated with the radiomics signature significantly. It was found that the radiomics signature was an independent predictor for peritoneal metastasis in multivariable logistic analysis. For training cohort, internal and external validation cohort, the discrimination accuracies of radiomic signature for predicting PM were 0.751(95%CI, 0.703-0.799), 0.802(95%CI, 0.691-0.912), and 0.745(95%CI, 0.683-0.806), respectively. Furthermore, for training cohort, internal and external validation cohort, the discrimination accuracies of radiomic nomogram for predicting PM were 0.792(95%CI, 0.748-0.836), 0.870(95%CI, 0.795-0.946) and 0.815(95%CI, 0.763-0.867), respectively.

One hundred and four ovarian lesions were evaluated using preoperative DCE-MRI. Radiomics features were extracted from 7 types of DCE-MR images. To explore the differential ability of radiomics between three types of ovarian tumors, two- and three-class classification tasks were established. The 2-class classification task was divided into three subtasks: benign vs. borderline (task A), benign vs. malignant (task B), and borderline vs. malignant (task C). For the 3-class classification task, 104 lesions were randomly divided into training (72 lesions) and validation (32 lesions) cohorts. The discrimination abilities of the radiomics signatures were established with the training cohort and tested with the independent validation cohort. The predictive performance of the task was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve analysis, and decision curve analysis (DCA). For the 2-class classification task, the combination of PK radiomics signatures model (PK model) showed a good diagnostic ability with the highest area under the ROC curves (AUCs) of 0.899, 0.865, and 0.893 for tasks A, B, and C, respectively. Additionally, the 3-class classification task demonstrated a good discrimination performance with AUCs of 0.893, 0.944, and 0.891 for the benign, borderline, and malignant groups, respectively. Radiomics analysis based on the DCE-MRI PK protocol showed promise for discriminating among benign, borderline, and malignant ovarian tumors.                 • Two-class classification predictive task of DCE-MRI PK protocol enabled the classification of 3 categories of ovarian tumors through the pairwise comparison strategy witha perfect diagnostic ability. • Three-class classification predictive task maintained good performance to effectively judge each category of ovarian tumors directly.","Xiaoli Song,Xiao-li Song,Jialiang Ren,Dan Zhao,Jialiang Ren,Jia-Liang Ren,Dan Zhao,Lifang Wang,Honghong Ren,Lifang Wang,Jinliang Niu,Honghong Ren,Jinliang Niu",European Radiology,2020.0

This review describes this approach and its use in the evaluation of pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs). This discipline has the potential of more accurately assessing, classifying, risk stratifying, and guiding the management of PCLs. Existing studies have provided important insight into the role of radiomics in managing PCLs. Although these studies are limited by the use of retrospective design, single center data, and small sample sizes, radiomic features in combination with clinical data appear to be superior to the current standard of care in differentiating cyst type and in identifying mucinous PCLs with high-grade dysplasia. Combining radiomic features with other novel endoscopic diagnostics, including cyst fluid molecular analysis and confocal endomicroscopy, can potentially optimize the predictive accuracy of these models. There is a need for multicenter prospective studies to elucidate the role of radiomics in the management of PCLs.","Jorge D. Machicado,Jorge D. Machicado,Eugene J. Koay,Somashekar G.

The radiomics approach has the capacity to construct predictive models for treatment response, essential for the pursuit of personalised medicine. In this literature review, we summarise the current status and evaluate the scientific and reporting quality of radiomics research in the prediction of treatment response in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed database. A total of 178 articles were screened for eligibility and 14 peer-reviewed articles were included. The radiomics quality score (RQS), a radiomics-specific quality metric emulating the TRIPOD guidelines, was used to assess scientific and reporting quality. Included studies reported several predictive markers including first-, second- and high-order features, such as kurtosis, grey-level uniformity and wavelet HLL mean respectively, as well as PET-based metabolic parameters. Quality assessment demonstrated a low median score of +2.5 (range −5 to +9), mainly reflecting a lack of reproducibility and clinical evaluation. There was extensive heterogeneity between studies due to differences in patient population, cancer stage, treatment modality, follow-up timescales and radiomics workflow methodology. Radiomics research has not yet been translated into clinical use. Efforts towards standardisation and collaboration are needed to identify reproducible radiomic predictors of response. Promising radiomic models must be externally validated and their impact evaluated within the clinical pathway before they can be implemented as a clinical decision-making tool to facilitate personalised treatment for patients with NSCLC.                 • The included studies reported several promising radiomic markers of treatment response in lung cancer; however, there was a lack of reproducibility between studies. • Quality assessment using the radiomics quality score (RQS) demonstrated a low median total score of +2.5 (range −5 to +9). • Future radiomics research should focus on implementation of standardised radiomics features and software, together with external validation in a prospective setting.","Madhurima Chetan,Madhurima R.

Quantitative feature extraction is one of the critical steps of radiomics. The association between radiomics features and the clinicopathological information of diseases can be identified by several statistics methods. For instance, although significant progress has been made in the field of lung cancer, too many questions remain, especially for the individualized decisions. Radiomics offers a new tool to encode the characteristics of lung cancer which is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Here, we reviewed the workflow and clinical utility of radiomics in lung cancer management, including pulmonary nodules detection, classification, histopathology and genetics evaluation, clinical staging, therapy response, and prognosis prediction. Most of these studies showed positive results, indicating the potential value of radiomics in clinical practice. The implementation of radiomics is both feasible and invaluable, and has aided clinicians in ascertaining the nature of a disease with greater precision. However, it should be noted that radiomics in its current state cannot completely replace the work of therapists or tissue examination. The potential future trends of this modality were also remarked. More efforts are needed to overcome the limitations identified above in order to facilitate the widespread application of radiomics in the reasonably near future.","Bojiang Chen,Bojiang Chen,Bojiang Chen,Lan Yang,Lan Yang,Rui Zhang,Lan Yang,Rui Zhang,Wenxin Luo,Rui Zhang,Weimin Liu,Wenxin Luo,Weimin Li,Li Weimin",,2020.0

METHODS A total of 60 patients with pathologically confirmed PDAC were included in the study. All patients underwent preoperative abdominal contrast-enhanced MRI examination with Magnetom Aera (Siemens Healthcare, Germany, 1.5 T) at our institute. Whole-tumor evaluation including texture analysis was performed. Sections of specimens were reviewed, and the S100A4 expression status was quantitatively evaluated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to find imaging biomarkers that could predict S100A4 overexpression. RESULTS Twenty-four tumors (40.0%) had negative results for S100A4 overexpression, and 36 tumors (60.0%) exhibited overexpression. After univariate and multivariate analysis, distal pancreatic duct dilatation, T1WI_10th percentile and the enhancement rate difference between delayed phase (DP) and portal venous phase (PVP) were identified to predict S100A4 overexpression in PDAC independently (p=0.009, 0.012 and 0.044), with odds ratios (ORs) of 0.102, 0.139 and 4.645, respectively.

The objective was to differentiate benign from malignant orbital lesions using radiomics on 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS This institutional review board-approved prospective single-center study enrolled consecutive patients presenting with an orbital lesion undergoing a 3 T MRI prior to surgery from December 2015 to July 2019. Radiomics features were extracted from 6 MRI sequences (T1-weighted images [WIs], DIXON-T2-WI, diffusion-WI, postcontrast DIXON-T1-WI) using the Pyradiomics software. Features were selected based on their intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility, nonredundancy, and with a sequential step forward feature selection method. Selected features were used to train and optimize a Random Forest algorithm on the training set (75%) with 5-fold cross-validation. Performance metrics were computed on a held-out test set (25%) with bootstrap 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Five residents, 4 general radiologists, and 3 expert neuroradiologists were evaluated on their ability to visually distinguish benign from malignant lesions on the test set. Performance comparisons between reader groups and the model were performed using McNemar test. The impact of clinical and categorizable imaging data on algorithm performance was also assessed. RESULTS A total of 200 patients (116 [58%] women and 84 [42%] men; mean age, 53.0 ± 17.9 years) with 126 of 200 (63%) benign and 74 of 200 (37%) malignant orbital lesions were included in the study. A total of 606 radiomics features were extracted. The best performing model on the training set was composed of 8 features including apparent diffusion coefficient mean value, maximum diameter on T1-WIs, and texture features. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity on the test set were respectively 0.869 (95% CI, 0.834-0.898), 0.840 (95% CI, 0.806-0.874), 0.684 (95% CI, 0.615-0.751), and 0.935 (95% CI, 0.905-0.961). The radiomics model outperformed all reader groups, including expert neuroradiologists (P < 0.01). Adding clinical and categorizable imaging data did not significantly impact the algorithm performance (P = 0.49). CONCLUSIONS An MRI radiomics signature is helpful in differentiating benign from malignant orbital lesions and may outperform expert radiologists.","Loïc Duron,Loïc Duron,Alexandre Heraud,Alexandre Heraud,F.

10.3389/fonc.2020.570502,,,A Preliminary Study for Distinguish Hormone-Secreting Functional Adrenocortical Adenoma Subtypes Using Multiparametric CT Radiomics-Based Machine Learning Model and Nomogram.,"Purpose: To explore the application value of multiparametric computed tomography (CT) radiomics in non-invasive differentiation between aldosterone-producing and cortisol-producing functional adrenocortical adenomas. Methods: This retrospective review analyzed 83 patients including 41 patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma and 42 patients with cortisol-producing adenoma. The quantitative radiomics features were extracted from the complete unenhanced, arterial, and venous phase CT images. A comparative study of several frequently used machine learning models (linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine) combined with different feature selection methods was implemented in order to determine which was most advantageous for differential diagnosis using radiomics features. Then, the integrated model using the combination of radiomic signature and clinic-radiological features was built, and the associated calibration curve was also presented. The diagnostic performance of these models was estimated and compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Result: In the radiomics-based machine learning model, logistic regression model with LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) outperformed the other models, which yielded a sensitivity of 0.935, a specificity of 0.823, and an accuracy of 0.887 [AUC = 0.882, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.819-0.945]. Moreover, the nomogram representing the integrated model achieved good discrimination performances, which yielded a sensitivity of 0.915, a specificity of 0.928, and an accuracy of 0.922 (AUC = 0.902, 95% CI = 0.822-0.982), and it was better than that of the radiomics model alone. Conclusion: This study found that the combination of multiparametric radiomics signature and clinic-radiological features can non-invasively differentiate the subtypes of hormone-secreting functional adrenocortical adenomas, which may have good potential for facilitating the diagnosis and treatment in clinical practice.","Yineng Zheng,Xin Liu,Yineng Zheng,Yi Zhong,Xin Liu,Xin Liu,Fajin Lv,Yi Zhong,Haitao Yang,Fajin Lv,Fajin Lv,Haitao Yang",Frontiers in Oncology,2020.0

Because of steady therapeutic refinements and the availability of cutting-edge technical solutions, the ceiling of organs-at- risk-sparing has been reached for photon-based intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The possibility to capture heterogeneity of patients and tissues in the prediction of toxicity is still an unmet need in modern radiation therapy. Potentially, a major step towards a wider therapeutic index could be obtained from refined assessment of radiation-induced morbidity at an individual level. The rising integration of quantitative imaging and machine learning applications into radiation oncology workflow offers an unprecedented opportunity to further explore the biologic interplay underlying the normal tissue response to radiation. Based on these premises, in this review we focused on the current-state-of-the-art on the use of radiomics for the prediction of toxicity in the field of head and neck, lung, breast and prostate radiotherapy.","Isacco Desideri,Isacco Desideri,Mauro Loi,Mauro Loi,Giulio Francolini,Giulio Francolini,Carlotta Becherini,Carlotta Becherini,Lorenzo Livi,Lorenzo Livi,Pierluigi Bonomo,Pierluigi Bonomo",Frontiers in Oncology,2020.0
10.3748/wjg.v26.i37.5617,,,Application of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma: A review,"Although artificial intelligence (AI) was initially developed many years ago, it has experienced spectacular advances over the last 10 years for application in the field of medicine, and is now used for diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic purposes in almost all fields. Its application in the area of hepatology is especially relevant for the study of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as this is a very common tumor, with particular radiological characteristics that allow its diagnosis without the need for a histological study. However, the interpretation and analysis of the resulting images is not always easy, in addition to which the images vary during the course of the disease, and prognosis and treatment response can be conditioned by multiple factors. The vast amount of data available lend themselves to study and analysis by AI in its various branches, such as deep-learning (DL) and machine learning (ML), which play a fundamental role in decision-making as well as overcoming the constraints involved in human evaluation. ML is a form of AI based on automated learning from a set of previously provided data and training in algorithms to organize and recognize patterns. DL is a more extensive form of learning that attempts to simulate the working of the human brain, using a lot more data and more complex algorithms. This review specifies the type of AI used by the various authors. However, well-designed prospective studies are needed in order to avoid as far as possible any bias that may later affect the interpretability of the images and thereby limit the acceptance and application of these models in clinical practice. In addition, professionals now need to understand the true usefulness of these techniques, as well as their associated strengths and limitations.","Miguel Jiménez Pérez,Rocío González Grande,Miguel Jiménez Pérez,Rocío González Grande",World Journal of Gastroenterology,2020.0

IPMNs were classified as benign (low-grade dysplasia, n = 181), or malignant (high grade, n = 128, and invasive, n = 99). Clinicobiological data were reported. Patients were divided into a training cohort (TC) of 296 patients and an external validation cohort (EVC) of 112 patients. After semi-automatic tumor segmentation, PyRadiomics was used to extract radiomics features. A multivariate model was developed using a logistic regression approach. In the training cohort, 85/107 radiomics features were significantly different between patients with benign and malignant IPMNs. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed four distinct clusters of patients with similar radiomics features patterns with malignancy as the most significant association. The multivariate model differentiated benign from malignant tumors in TC with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.84, sensitivity (Se) of 0.82, specificity (Spe) of 0.74, and in EVC with an AUC of 0.71, Se of 0.69, Spe of 0.57.

10.1186/s40644-020-00359-2,33176885.0,,CT-based radiomics features in the prediction of thyroid cartilage invasion from laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND Laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LHSCC) with thyroid cartilage invasion are considered T4 and need total laryngectomy. However, the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis of thyroid cartilage invasion remains lower. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the potential of computed tomography (CT)-based radiomics features in the prediction of thyroid cartilage invasion from LHSCC. METHODS A total of 265 patients with pathologically proven LHSCC were enrolled in this retrospective study (86 with thyroid cartilage invasion and 179 without invasion). Two head and neck radiologists evaluated the thyroid cartilage invasion on CT images. Radiomics features were extracted from venous phase contrast-enhanced CT images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and logistic regression (LR) method were used for dimension reduction and model construction. In addition, the support vector machine-based synthetic minority oversampling (SVMSMOTE) algorithm was adopted to balance the dataset and a new LR-SVMSMOTE model was constructed. The performance of the radiologist and the two models were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and compared using the DeLong test. RESULTS The areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) in the prediction of thyroid cartilage invasion from LHSCC for the LR-SVMSMOTE model, LR model, and radiologist were 0.905 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.863 to 0.937)], 0.876 (95%CI: 0.830 to 0.913), and 0.721 (95%CI: 0.663-0.774), respectively. The AUCs of both models were higher than that of the radiologist assessment (all P<0.001). There was no significant difference in predictive performance between the LR-SVMSMOTE and LR models (P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS Models based on CT radiomic features can improve the accuracy of predicting thyroid cartilage invasion from LHSCC and provide a new potentially noninvasive method for preoperative prediction of thyroid cartilage invasion from LHSCC.","Ran Guo,Ran Guo,Jun Guo,Jian Guo,Jian Guo,Lichen Zhang,Xiaoxia Qu,Lichen Zhang,Shuangfeng Dai,Xiaoxia Qu,Ruchen Peng,Shuangfeng Dai,Ruchen Peng,Vincent Chong,Vincent Chong,Junfang Xian,Vincent F.

Quantitative analysis such as radiomics may provide a more objective approach. The purpose of this article is to systematically review the literature on computed tomography (CT) radiomics for grading and differentiating renal tumour subtypes. An educational perspective will also be provided. METHODS The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist was followed. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for relevant articles. The quality of each study was assessed using the Radiomic Quality Score (RQS). RESULTS 13 studies were found. The main outcomes were prediction of pathological grade and differentiating between renal tumour types, measured as area under the curve (AUC) for either the receiver operator curve or precision recall curve. Features extracted to predict pathological grade or tumour subtype included shape, intensity, texture and wavelet (a type of higher order feature). Four studies differentiated between low-grade and high-grade clear cell renal cell cancer (RCC) with good performance (AUC=0.82-0.978). One other study differentiated low- and high-grade chromophobe with AUC=0.84. Finally, eight studies used radiomics to differentiate between tumour types such as clear cell RCC, fat-poor angiomyolipoma, papillary RCC, chromophobe RCC and renal oncocytoma with high levels of performance (AUC 0.82-0.96). CONCLUSION Renal tumours can be pathologically classified using CT-based radiomics with good performance. The main radiomic feature used for tumour differentiation was texture. Fuhrman was the most common pathologic grading system used in the reviewed studies. Renal tumour grading studies should be extended beyond clear cell RCC and chromophobe RCC.

10.1109/tmi.2020.3035789,33147142.0,,Combined Spiral Transformation and Model-Driven Multi-Modal Deep Learning Scheme for Automatic Prediction of TP53 Mutation in Pancreatic Cancer,"Pancreatic cancer is a malignant form of cancer with one of the worst prognoses. The poor prognosis and resistance to therapeutic modalities have been linked to TP53 mutation. Pathological examinations, such as biopsies, cannot be frequently performed in clinical practice; therefore, noninvasive and reproducible methods are desired. However, automatic prediction methods based on imaging have drawbacks such as poor 3D information utilization, small sample size, and ineffectiveness multi-modal fusion. In this study, we proposed a model-driven multi-modal deep learning scheme to overcome these challenges. A spiral transformation algorithm was developed to obtain 2D images from 3D data, with the transformed image inheriting and retaining the spatial correlation of the original texture and edge information. The spiral transformation could be used to effectively apply the 3D information with less computational resources and conveniently augment the data size with high quality. Moreover, model-driven items were designed to introduce prior knowledge in the deep learning framework for multi-modal fusion. The model-driven strategy and spiral transformation-based data augmentation can improve the performance of the small sample size. A bilinear pooling module was introduced to improve the performance of fine-grained prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed model gives the desired performance in predicting TP53 mutation in pancreatic cancer, providing a new approach for noninvasive gene prediction. The proposed methodologies of spiral transformation and model-driven deep learning can also be used for the artificial intelligence community dealing with oncological applications.

A radiomics-based particle swarm optimization and support vector machine (PSO-SVM) model may provide a more accurate auxiliary diagnosis for assessing differentiation degree (DD) and lymph node metastasis (LNM) of ECC. OBJECTIVE The objective of our study is to develop a PSO-SVM radiomics model for predicting DD and LNM of ECC. METHODS For this retrospective study, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 110 patients with ECC who were diagnosed from January 2011 to October 2019 were used to construct a radiomics prediction model. Radiomics features were extracted from T1-precontrast weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) using MaZda software (version 4.6; Institute of Electronics, Technical University of Lodz). We performed dimension reduction to obtain 30 optimal features of each sequence, respectively. A PSO-SVM radiomics model was developed to predict DD and LNM of ECC by incorporating radiomics features and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. We randomly divided the 110 cases into a training group (88/110, 80%) and a testing group (22/110, 20%). The performance of the model was evaluated by analyzing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS A radiomics model based on PSO-SVM was developed by using 110 patients with ECC. This model produced average AUCs of 0.8905 and 0.8461, respectively, for DD in the training and testing groups of patients with ECC. The average AUCs of the LNM in the training and testing groups of patients with ECC were 0.9036 and 0.8889, respectively. For the 110 patients, this model has high predictive performance. The average accuracy values of the training group and testing group for DD of ECC were 82.6% and 80.9%, respectively; the average accuracy values of the training group and testing group for LNM of ECC were 83.6% and 81.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The MRI-based PSO-SVM radiomics model might be useful for auxiliary clinical diagnosis and decision-making, which has a good potential for clinical application for DD and LNM of ECC.","Xiaopeng Yao,Xiaopeng Yao,Xinqiao Huang,Chunmei Yang,Xinqiao Huang,Chunmei Yang,Anbin Hu,Anbin Hu,Anbin Hu,Guangjin Zhou,Mei Ju,Guangjin Zhou,Jianbo Lei,Jianbo Lei,Mei Ju,Jianbo Lei,Jian Shu,Jiwu Shu,Jian Shu,Jian Shu",JMIR medical informatics,2020.0

The gold standard for diagnosing GEV is esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). However, EGD is invasive and less tolerant. This study aimed to develop and validate radiomics signatures based on non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images for non-invasive diagnosis of GEV and HRV in patients with cACLD. METHODS The multicenter trial enrolled 161 patients with cACLD from six university hospitals in China between January 2015 and September 2019, who underwent both EGD and non-contrast-enhanced CT examination within 14 days prior to the endoscopy. Two radiomics signatures, termed rGEV and rHRV, respectively, were built based on CT images in a training cohort of 129 patients and validated in a prospective validation cohort of 32 patients (ClinicalTrials. gov identifier: NCT03749954). RESULTS In the training cohort, both rGEV and rHRV exhibited high discriminative abilities on determining the existence of GEV and HRV with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0·941 (95% CI 0·904-0·978) and 0·836 (95% CI 0·766-0·905), respectively. In validation cohort, rGEV and rHRV showed high discriminative abilities with AUCs of 0·871 (95% CI 0·739-1·000) and 0·831 (95% CI 0·685-0·978), respectively.

10.7150/thno.50565,33052242.0,,Early response evaluation using primary tumor and nodal imaging features to predict progression-free survival of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.,"Prognostic biomarkers that can reliably predict early disease progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are needed for identifying those patients at high risk for progression, who may benefit from more intensive treatment. In this work, we aimed to identify an imaging signature for predicting progression-free survival (PFS) of locally advanced NSCLC. Methods: This retrospective study included 82 patients with stage III NSCLC treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy for whom both baseline and mid-treatment PET/CT scans were performed. They were randomly placed into two groups: training cohort (n=41) and testing cohort (n=41). All primary tumors and involved lymph nodes were delineated. Forty-five quantitative imaging features were extracted to characterize the tumors and involved nodes at baseline and mid-treatment as well as differences between two scans performed at these two points. An imaging signature was developed to predict PFS by fitting an L1-regularized Cox regression model. Results: The final imaging signature consisted of three imaging features: the baseline tumor volume, the baseline maximum distance between involved nodes, and the change in maximum distance between the primary tumor and involved nodes measured at two time points. According to multivariate analysis, the imaging model was an independent prognostic factor for PFS in both the training (hazard ratio [HR], 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.24; P = 0.003), and testing (HR, 1.21, 95% CI, 1.10-1.33; P = 0.048) cohorts. The imaging signature stratified patients into low- and high-risk groups, with 2-year PFS rates of 61.9% and 33.2%, respectively (P = 0.004 [log-rank test]; HR, 4.13, 95% CI, 1.42-11.70) in the training cohort, as well as 43.8% and 22.6%, respectively (P = 0.006 [log-rank test]; HR, 3.45, 95% CI, 1.35-8.83) in the testing cohort. In both cohorts, the imaging signature significantly outperformed conventional imaging metrics, including tumor volume and SUVmax value (C-indices: 0.77-0.79 for imaging signature, and 0.53-0.73 for conventional metrics). Conclusions: Evaluation of early treatment response by combining primary tumor and nodal imaging characteristics may improve the prediction of PFS of locally advanced NSCLC patients.","Nasha Zhang,Nasha Zhang,Ruyi Liang,Rachel Liang,Michael F.

With so many papers around, it is of paramount importance to make a proper scientific quality assessment as to their validity, reliability, effectiveness, and clinical applicability. Due to methodological complexity, the papers on ML in radiology are often hard to evaluate, requiring a good understanding of key methodological issues. In this review, we aimed to guide the radiology community about key methodological aspects of ML to improve their academic reading and peer-review experience. Key aspects of ML pipeline were presented within four broad categories: study design, data handling, modelling, and reporting. Sixteen key methodological items and related common pitfalls were reviewed with a fresh perspective: database size, robustness of reference standard, information leakage, feature scaling, reliability of features, high dimensionality, perturbations in feature selection, class balance, bias-variance trade-off, hyperparameter tuning, performance metrics, generalisability, clinical utility, comparison with traditional tools, data sharing, and transparent reporting.Key Points• Machine learning is new and rather complex for the radiology community.• Validity, reliability, effectiveness, and clinical applicability of studies on machine learning can be evaluated with a proper understanding of key methodological concepts about study design, data handling, modelling, and reporting.• Understanding key methodological concepts will provide a better academic reading and peer-review experience for the radiology community.","Burak Koçak,Ece Ateş Kuş,Burak Kocak,Ece Ates Kus,Özgür Kılıçkesmez,Ozgur Kilickesmez",European Radiology,2020.0

Feature variability over time was quantified using all combinations of three quantization algorithms and four different numbers of gray level intensities. In addition, texture features were extracted using the same combinations from the low field strength MR images of the gross tumor volume (GTV) and left kidney of patients with repeated set up scans. The impact of region of interest (ROI) preprocessing on repeatability was investigated with a test-retest study design. RESULTS The phantom ROIs quantized to 64Gy level intensities using the histogram equalization method resulted in the greatest number of features with the least variability. There was no clear method that resulted in the highest repeatability in the GTV or left kidney. However, eight texture features extracted from the GTV were repeatable regardless of ROI processing combination. CONCLUSION Low field strength MR images can provide a stable basis for texture analysis with ROIs quantized to 64Gy levels using histogram equalization, but there is no clear optimal combination for repeatability.","Garrett Simpson,John C.

We sought to determine whether an extensively validated, deterministic apoptosis systems model, ‘DR_MOMP’, could be used as a stratification tool for the apoptosis sensitiser and BCL-2 antagonist, ABT-199 in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of colorectal cancer (CRC). Through quantitative profiling of BCL-2 family proteins, we identified two PDX models which were predicted by DR_MOMP to be sufficiently sensitive to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy (CRC0344), or less responsive to chemotherapy but sensitised by ABT-199 (CRC0076). Treatment with ABT-199 significantly improved responses of CRC0076 PDXs to 5-FU-based chemotherapy, but showed no sensitisation in CRC0344 PDXs, as predicted from systems modelling. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) scans were performed to investigate possible early biomarkers of response. In CRC0076, a significant post-treatment decrease in mean standard uptake value was indeed evident only in the combination treatment group. Radiomic CT feature analysis of pre-treatment images in CRC0076 and CRC0344 PDXs identified features which could phenotypically discriminate between models, but were not predictive of treatment responses. Collectively our data indicate that systems modelling may identify metastatic (m)CRC patients benefitting from ABT-199, and that 18F-FDG-PET could independently support such predictions.","Alice C.

We hypothesize this innovation will improve our ability to stratify patients into various oncologic outcomes with greater accuracy.Two cohorts of patients with ES-NSCLC uniformly treated with SBRT (a median dose of 50 Gy in 4-5 fractions) were studied. Prediction models were built on a discovery cohort of 100 patients with treatment planning CT scans, and then were applied to a separate validation cohort of 60 patients with pre- and posttreatment CT scans for evaluating their performance.Prediction models achieved a c-index up to 0.734 in predicting survival outcomes of the validation cohort. The integration of the pretreatment risk of survival measures (risk-high vs risk-low) and changes (risk-increase vs risk-decrease) in risk of survival measures between the pretreatment and posttreatment scans further stratified the patients into 4 subgroups (risk: high, increase; risk: high, decrease; risk: low, increase; risk: low, decrease) with significant difference (χ2 = 18.549, P = .0003, log-rank test). There was also a significant difference between the risk-increase and risk-decrease groups (χ2 = 6.80, P = .0091, log-rank test). In addition, a significant difference (χ2 = 7.493, P = .0062, log-rank test) was observed between the risk-high and risk-low groups obtained based on the pretreatment risk of survival measures.The integration of risk of survival measures estimated from pre- and posttreatment CT scans can help differentiate patients with good expected survival from those who will do more poorly following SBRT. The analysis of these radiomics-based longitudinal risk measures may help identify patients with early-stage NSCLC who will benefit from adjuvant treatment after lung SBRT, such as immunotherapy.","Zhicheng Jiao,Z.

10.1038/s41598-020-72535-0,32968131.0,,Intensity harmonization techniques influence radiomics features and radiomics-based predictions in sarcoma patients.,"Intensity harmonization techniques (IHT) are mandatory to homogenize multicentric MRIs before any quantitative analysis because signal intensities (SI) do not have standardized units. Radiomics combine quantification of tumors' radiological phenotype with machine-learning to improve predictive models, such as metastastic-relapse-free survival (MFS) for sarcoma patients. We post-processed the initial T2-weighted-imaging of 70 sarcoma patients by using 5 IHTs and extracting 45 radiomics features (RFs), namely: classical standardization (IHTstd), standardization per adipose tissue SIs (IHTfat), histogram-matching with a patient histogram (IHTHM.1), with the average histogram of the population (IHTHM.All) and plus ComBat method (IHTHM.All.C), which provided 5 radiomics datasets in addition to the original radiomics dataset without IHT (No-IHT). We found that using IHTs significantly influenced all RFs values (p-values: < 0.0001-0.02). Unsupervised clustering performed on each radiomics dataset showed that only clusters from the No-IHT, IHTstd, IHTHM.All, and IHTHM.All.C datasets significantly correlated with MFS in multivariate Cox models (p = 0.02, 0.007, 0.004 and 0.02, respectively). We built radiomics-based supervised models to predict metastatic relapse at 2-years with a training set of 50 patients. The models performances varied markedly depending on the IHT in the validation set (range of AUROC from 0.688 with IHTstd to 0.823 with IHTHM.1). Hence, the use of intensity harmonization and the related technique should be carefully detailed in radiomics post-processing pipelines as it can profoundly affect the reproducibility of analyses.","Amandine Crombé,Michèle Kind,Amandine Crombé,Amandine Crombe,Michèle Kind,David Fadli,David Fadli,François Le Loarer,Antoîne Italiano,François Le Loarer,Xavier Buy,Antoine Italiano,Xavier Buy,Olivier Saut,Olivier Saut",Scientific Reports,2020.0

Patients and Methods A total of 127 patients were divided into a training set and testing set according to the ratio of 7:3. Radiomic features were extracted from multiphase CE-MRI (CEm). Rad-score was calculated using the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression analysis. The cutoff point of Rad-score to divide the patients into high- and low-risk groups was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. A Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the Log rank test were used to investigate the association of the Rad-score with DFS. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model were used to determine the association of Rad-score, MRI features, and clinicopathological variables with DFS. A radiomics-clinicoradiologic-based nomogram combining the Rad-score, MRI features, and clinicopathological findings was plotted to validate the radiomic signatures for DFS estimation. Results The Rad-score stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups for DFS in the training set (P<0.0001) and was validated in the testing set (P=0.002). The radiomics-clinicoradiologic-based nomogram estimated DFS (training set: C-index=0.974, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.954-0.994; testing set: C-index=0.917, 95% CI=0.842-0.991) better than the clinicoradiologic-based nomogram (training set: C-index=0.855, 95% CI=0.739-0.971; testing set: C-index=0.831, 95% CI=0.643-0.999).

Minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) was used to eliminate irrelevant and redundant features and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), to additionally select an optimized features' subset to construct the radiomics signature. Predictive performance was validated using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, while decision curve analyses (DCA) were conducted to evaluate the clinical worth of the four models according to different sequences. A radiomics nomogram was built using multivariate logistic regression model. The nomogram's performance was assessed and validated in the training and validation cohorts, respectively.Seven key features were selected from T2WI, five from DWI, ten from T1C+ and seven from the combined images. The scores (Rad-scores) of patients with LNM were significantly higher than patients with non-LNM in both the training cohort and the validation cohort. The combined model performed better than the T2WI, DWI, and T1C+ models alone in both cohorts. In the training cohort, the area under the ROC (AUC) values of T2WI, DWI, T1C+ and combined features were 0.819, 0.826, 0.808, and 0.835, respectively; corresponding values in the validation cohort were 0.798, 0.798, 0.789, and 0.830. The clinical utility of the combined model was confirmed using the radiomics nomogram and DCA.MRI radiomic model based on anatomical and functional MRI images could be used as a non-invasive biomarker to identify PTC patients at high risk of LNM, which could help to develop individualized treatment strategies in clinical practice.","Wenjuan Hu,Hao Wang,Wenjuan Hu,Hao Wang,Ran Wei,Lanyun Wang,Ran Wei,Zedong Dai,Lanyun Wang,Zedong Dai,Shaofeng Duan,Yubin Ge,Shaofeng Duan,Yaqiong Ge,Pu-Yeh Wu,Pu-Yeh Wu,Bin Song,Bin Song",Gland surgery,2020.0
10.1155/2020/1712604,,,Machine Learning Based on a Multiparametric and Multiregional Radiomics Signature Predicts Radiotherapeutic Response in Patients with Glioblastoma.,"Background and Objective. Although radiotherapy has become one of the main treatment methods for cancer, there is no noninvasive method to predict the radiotherapeutic response of individual glioblastoma (GBM) patients before surgery. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a machine learning-based radiomics signature to predict the radiotherapeutic response of GBM patients. Methods. The MRI images, genetic data, and clinical data of 152 patients with GBM were analyzed. 122 patients from the TCIA dataset (training set: <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1""> <mi>n</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>82</mn> </math> ; validation set: <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M2""> <mi>n</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>40</mn> </math> ) and 30 patients from local hospitals were used as an independent test dataset. Radiomics features were extracted from multiple regions of multiparameter MRI. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to verify the ability of the imaging signature to predict the response of GBM patients to radiotherapy before an operation. Multivariate Cox regression including radiomics signature and preoperative clinical risk factors was used to further improve the ability to predict the overall survival (OS) of individual GBM patients, which was presented in the form of a nomogram. Results. The radiomics signature was built by eight selected features. The <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M3""> <mi>C</mi> </math> -index of the radiomics signature in the TCIA and independent test cohorts was 0.703 ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M4""> <mi>P</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.001</mn> </math> ) and 0.757 ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M5""> <mi>P</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0.001</mn> </math> ), respectively.

10.1016/j.acra.2020.10.015,,,Optimizing the Peritumoral Region Size in Radiomics Analysis for Sentinel Lymph Node Status Prediction in Breast Cancer.,"Rationale and Objectives  Peritumoral features have been suggested to be useful in improving the prediction performance of radiomic models. The aim of this study is to systematically investigate the prediction performance improvement for sentinel lymph node (SLN) status in breast cancer from peritumoral features in radiomic analysis by exploring the effect of peritumoral region sizes.    Materials and Methods  This retrospective study was performed using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scans of 162 breast cancer patients. The effect of peritumoral features was evaluated in a radiomics pipeline for predicting SLN metastasis in breast cancer. Peritumoral regions were generated by dilating the tumor regions-of-interest (ROIs) manually annotated by two expert radiologists, with thicknesses of 2 mm, 4 mm, 6 mm, and 8 mm. The prediction models were established in the training set (∼67% of cases) using the radiomics pipeline with and without peritumoral features derived from different peritumoral thicknesses. The prediction performance was tested in an independent validation set (the remaining ∼33%).    Results  For this specific application, the accuracy in the validation set when using the two radiologists’ ROIs could be both improved from 0.704 to 0.796 by incorporating peritumoral features. The choice of the peritumoral size could affect the level of improvement.    Conclusion  This study systematically investigates the effect of peritumoral region sizes in radiomic analysis for prediction performance improvement. The choice of the peritumoral size is dependent on the ROI drawing and would affect the final prediction performance of radiomic models, suggesting that peritumoral features should be optimized in future radiomics studies.","Jie Ding,Jie Ding,Shenglan Chen,Shenglan Chen,Mario Serrano Sosa,Renee Cattell,Mario Serrano Sosa,Renee Cattell,Lei Lan,Jinhua Sun,Lan Lei,Prateek Prasanna,Junqi Sun,Prateek Prasanna,Chunling Liu,Chunling Liu,Chuan Huang,Chuan Huang",Academic Radiology,2020.0

The search was conducted in the MEDLINE database. Human studies that investigated the applications of radiomics in diseases of the pancreas were included. The radiomics quality score was calculated for each included study. A total of 72 studies encompassing 8863 participants were included. Of them, 66 investigated focal pancreatic lesions (pancreatic cancer, precancerous lesions, or benign lesions); 4, pancreatitis; and 2, diabetes mellitus. The principal applications of radiomics were differential diagnosis between various types of focal pancreatic lesions (n=19), classification of pancreatic diseases (n=23), and prediction of prognosis or treatment response (n=30). Second-order texture features were most useful for the purpose of differential diagnosis of diseases of the pancreas (with 100% of studies investigating them found a statistically significant feature), whereas filtered image features were most useful for the purpose of classification of diseases of the pancreas and prediction of diseases of the pancreas (with 100% of studies investigating them found a statistically significant feature). The median radiomics quality score of the included studies was 28%, with the interquartile range of 22% to 36%. The radiomics quality score was significantly correlated with the number of extracted radiomics features (r=0.52, p<0.001) and the study sample size (r=0.34, p=0.003). Radiomics of the pancreas holds promise as a quantitative imaging biomarker of both focal pancreatic lesions and diffuse changes of the pancreas. The usefulness of radiomics features may vary depending on the purpose of their application. Standardisation of image acquisition protocols and image pre-processing is warranted prior to considering the use of radiomics of the pancreas in routine clinical practice.                 • Methodologically sound studies on radiomics of the pancreas are characterised by a large sample size and a large number of extracted features. • Optimisation of the radiomics pipeline will increase the clinical utility of mineable pancreas imaging data. • Radiomics of the pancreas is a promising personalised medicine tool in diseases of the pancreas.","Bassam M.

We aimed to devise novel objective imaging biomarkers for prediction of locoregional progression in HPV-associated OPSCC. Following manual lesion delineation, 1037 PET and 1037 CT radiomic features were extracted from each primary tumor and metastatic cervical lymph node on baseline PET/CT scans. Applying random forest machine-learning algorithms, we generated radiomic models for censoring-aware locoregional progression prognostication (evaluated by Harrell's C-index) and risk stratification (evaluated in Kaplan-Meier analysis). A total of 190 patients were included; an optimized model yielded a median (interquartile range) C-index of 0.76(0.66-0.81;p=0.01) in prognostication of locoregional progression, using combined PET/CT radiomic features from primary tumors. Radiomics-based risk stratification reliably identified patients at risk for locoregional progression within 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year follow-up intervals, with log-rank p-values of p=0.003, p=0.001, p=0.02, p=0.006 in Kaplan-Meier analysis, respectively. Our results suggest PET/CT radiomic biomarkers can predict post-radiotherapy locoregional progression in HPV-associated OPSCC. Pending validation in large, independent cohorts, such objective biomarkers may improve patient selection for treatment de-intensification trials in this prognostically favorable OPSCC entity, and eventually facilitate personalized therapy.","Stefan P.

It is simplified and can be conducted easily in clinical practice, and this subtyping undoubtedly contributes to the treatment selection of breast cancer. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using a Fisher discriminant analysis model based on radiomic features of diffusion-weighted MRI for predicting the clinicopathological subtypes of breast cancer. METHODS Patients who underwent breast magnetic resonance imaging were confirmed by retrieving data from our institutional picture archiving and communication system (PACS) between March 2013 and September 2017. Five clinicopathological subtypes were determined based on the status of ER, PR, HER2 and Ki-67 from the immunohistochemical test. The radiomic features of diffusion-weighted imaging were derived from the volume of interest (VOI) of each tumour. Fisher discriminant analysis was performed for clinicopathological subtyping by using a backward selection method. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the radiomic features, ROC analyses were performed to differentiate between immunohistochemical biomarker-positive and -negative groups. RESULTS A total of 84 radiomic features of four statistical methods were included after preprocessing. The overall accuracy for predicting the clinicopathological subtypes was 96.4% by Fisher discriminant analysis, and the weighted accuracy was 96.6%. For predicting diverse clinicopathological subtypes, the prediction accuracies ranged from 92 to 100%. According to the cross-validation, the overall accuracy of the model was 82.1%, and the accuracies of the model for predicting the luminal A, luminal BHER2-, luminal BHER2+, HER2 positive and triple negative subtypes were 79, 77, 88, 92 and 73%, respectively. According to the ROC analysis, the radiomic features had excellent performance in differentiating between different statuses of ER, PR, HER2 and Ki-67. CONCLUSIONS The Fisher discriminant analysis model based on radiomic features of diffusion-weighted MRI is a reliable method for the prediction of clinicopathological breast cancer subtypes.","Ming Ni,Ming Ni,Xiaoming Zhou,Jingwei Liu,Xiaoming Zhou,Haiyang Yu,Jingwei Liu,Haiyang Yu,Yong Gao,Xuexi Zhang,Yuanxiang Gao,Zhiming Li,Xuexi Zhang,Zhiming Li",BMC Cancer,2020.0

10.3389/frai.2020.550890,,,Prognostic Value of Transfer Learning Based Features in Resectable Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.,"Background: Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive cancers with an extremely poor prognosis. Radiomics has shown prognostic ability in multiple types of cancer including PDAC. However, the prognostic value of traditional radiomics pipelines, which are based on hand-crafted radiomic features alone is limited. Methods: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to outperform radiomics models in computer vision tasks. However, training a CNN from scratch requires a large sample size which is not feasible in most medical imaging studies. As an alternative solution, CNN-based transfer learning models have shown the potential for achieving reasonable performance using small datasets. In this work, we developed and validated a CNN-based transfer learning model for prognostication of overall survival in PDAC patients using two independent resectable PDAC cohorts. Results: The proposed transfer learning-based prognostication model achieved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 on the test cohort, which was significantly higher than that of the traditional radiomics model (0.54). To further assess the prognostic value of the models, the predicted probabilities of death generated from the two models were used as risk scores in a univariate Cox Proportional Hazard model and while the risk score from radiomics model was not associated with overall survival, the proposed transfer learning-based risk score had significant prognostic value with hazard ratio of 1.86 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.15-3.53, p-value: 0.04). Conclusions: This result suggests that transfer learning-based models may significantly improve prognostic performance in typical small sample size medical imaging studies.","Yucheng Zhang,Edrise M.

The area of the primary tumor was semi-automatically contoured with a threshold of 40% of the maximum standardized uptake value, and 42 PET features were extracted. To identify relevant PET parameters for predicting 1-year survival, Gini index was measured using random forest (RF) classifier. Twenty-three patients were censored within 1year of follow-up, and the remaining 138 patients were used for the analysis. Among the PET parameters, 10 features showed statistical significance for predicting overall survival. Multivariate analysis using Cox HR regression revealed gray-level zone length matrix (GLZLM) gray-level non-uniformity (GLNU) as the only PET parameter showing statistical significance. In RF model, GLZLM GLNU was the most relevant factor for predicting 1-year survival, followed by total lesion glycolysis (TLG).

Adherence rates for the following six key domains were evaluated: image protocol and reproducibility, feature reduction and validation, biologic/clinical utility, performance index, high level of evidence, and open science. RESULTS The hippocampus was the most frequently analyzed (46.2%) anatomical structure. Of the 26 studies, 16 (61.5%) used an open source database (14 from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and 2 from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies). The mean RQS was 3.6 out of 36 (9.9%), and the basic adherence rate was 27.6%. Only one study (3.8%) performed external validation. The adherence rate was relatively high for reporting the imaging protocol (96.2%), multiple segmentation (76.9%), discrimination statistics (69.2%), and open science and data (65.4%) but low for conducting test-retest analysis (7.7%) and biologic correlation (3.8%). None of the studies stated potential clinical utility, conducted a phantom study, performed cut-off analysis or calibration statistics, was a prospective study, or conducted cost-effectiveness analysis, resulting in a low level of evidence. CONCLUSION The quality of radiomics reporting in MCI and AD studies is suboptimal. Validation is necessary using external dataset, and improvements need to be made to feature reproducibility, feature selection, clinical utility, model performance index, and pursuits of a higher level of evidence.","So Yeon Won,Yae Won Park,So Yeon Won,Mina Park,Yae Won Park,Sung Soo Ahn,Mina Park,Ji Hoon Kim,Jinna Kim,Sung Soo Ahn,Seung Koo Lee,Jinna Kim,Sang Kil Lee,Seung-Koo Lee",Korean Journal of Radiology,2020.0
10.3389/fcvm.2020.591368,,,Radiomics Signatures of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Cardiac MRI: Results From the UK Biobank.,"Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) radiomics is a novel technique for advanced cardiac image phenotyping by analyzing multiple quantifiers of shape and tissue texture. In this paper, we assess, in the largest sample published to date, the performance of CMR radiomics models for identifying subclinical changes in cardiac structure and tissue due to cardiovascular risk factors. We evaluated five risk factor groups from the first 5,065 UK Biobank participants: hypertension (n=1,394), diabetes (n=243), high cholesterol (n=779), current smoker (n=320), and previous smoker (n=1,394). Each group was randomly matched with an equal number of healthy comparators (without known cardiovascular disease or risk factors). Radiomics analysis was applied to short axis images of the left and right ventricles at end-diastole and end-systole, yielding a total of 684 features per study. Sequential forward feature selection in combination with machine learning (ML) algorithms (support vector machine, random forest and logistic regression) were used to build radiomics signatures for each specific risk group. We evaluated the degree of separation achieved by the identified radiomics signatures using area under curve (AUC), receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and statistical testing. Logistic regression with L1-regularization was the optimal ML model. Compared to conventional imaging indices, radiomics signatures improved the discrimination of risk factor vs. healthy subgroups as assessed by AUC [diabetes: 0.80 vs. 0.70, hypertension: 0.72 vs. 0.68, high cholesterol: 0.71 vs. 0.65, current smoker: 0.68 vs. 0.65, previous smoker: 0.63 vs. 0.60]. Furthermore, we considered clinical interpretation of risk-specific radiomics signatures. For hypertensive individuals and previous smokers, the surface area to volume ratio was smaller in the risk factor vs. healthy subjects; perhaps reflecting a pattern of global concentric hypertrophy in these conditions. In the diabetes subgroup, the most discriminatory radiomics feature was the median intensity of the myocardium at end-systole, which suggests a global alteration at the myocardial tissue level. This study confirms the feasibility and potential of CMR radiomics for deeper image phenotyping of cardiovascular health and disease. We demonstrate such analysis may have utility beyond conventional CMR metrics for improved detection and understanding of the early effects of cardiovascular risk factors on cardiac structure and tissue.","Irem Cetin,Zahra Raisi‐Estabragh,Irem Cetin,Steffen E.

The aim of this review was to assess the current possibilities and limitations of radiomics (on CT, MRI and PET) for the prediction of treatment outcome and long-term outcome in CRC.    Methods  MEDLINE/PubMed was searched up to August 2020 for studies that used radiomics for the prediction of response to treatment and survival in patients with CRC (based on pre-treatment imaging). The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool and Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) were used for quality assessment.    Results  A total of 76 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included for further analysis. Radiomics analyses were performed on MRI in 41 studies, on CT in 30 studies and on 18F-FDG-PET-CT in 10 studies. Heterogeneous results were reported regarding radiomics methods and included features. High quality studies (n=13), consisting mainly of MRI-based radiomics to predict response in rectal cancer, were able to predict response with a good performance.    Conclusion  Radiomics literature in CRC is highly heterogeneous, nonetheless it holds promise for the prediction of outcome. The most evidence is available for MRI-based radiomics in rectal cancer. Future radiomics research in CRC should focus on independent validation of existing models rather than developing new models.","Femke C.R. Staal,Femke C.R.

10.3390/cancers12102881,33036490.0,,Radiomics of Liver Metastases: A Systematic Review.,"Multidisciplinary management of patients with liver metastases (LM) requires a precision medicine approach, based on adequate profiling of tumor biology and robust biomarkers. Radiomics, defined as the high-throughput identification, analysis, and translational applications of radiological textural features, could fulfill this need. The present review aims to elucidate the contribution of radiomic analyses to the management of patients with LM. We performed a systematic review of the literature through the most relevant databases and web sources. English language original articles published before June 2020 and concerning radiomics of LM extracted from CT, MRI, or PET-CT were considered. Thirty-two papers were identified. Baseline higher entropy and lower homogeneity of LM were associated with better survival and higher chemotherapy response rates. A decrease in entropy and an increase in homogeneity after chemotherapy correlated with radiological tumor response. Entropy and homogeneity were also highly predictive of tumor regression grade. In comparison with RECIST criteria, radiomic features provided an earlier prediction of response to chemotherapy. Lastly, texture analyses could differentiate LM from other liver tumors. The commonest limitations of studies were small sample size, retrospective design, lack of validation datasets, and unavailability of univocal cut-off values of radiomic features. In conclusion, radiomics can potentially contribute to the precision medicine approach to patients with LM, but interdisciplinarity, standardization, and adequate software tools are needed to translate the anticipated potentialities into clinical practice.","Francesco Fiz,Luca Viganò,F Fiz,Francesco Fiz,Luca Viganò,Nicolò Gennaro,Guido Costa,Nicolò Gennaro,Ludovico la Bella,Guido Costa,Alexandra Boichuk,Ludovico La Bella,Lara Cavinato,Alexandra Boichuk,Martina Sollini,Lara Cavinato,Martina Sollini,Letterio S.

Nevertheless, none of the published studies focusing on the prognostic value of PET-derived features at baseline consider tumor heterogeneity, which could be of high importance in MM. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of baseline PET-derived features in transplant-eligible newly diagnosed (TEND) MM patients enrolled in two prospective independent European randomized phase III trials using an innovative statistical random survival forest (RSF) approach.  Methods  Imaging ancillary studies of IFM/DFCI2009 and EMN02/HO95 trials formed part of the present analysis (IMAJEM and EMN02/HO95, respectively). Among all patients initially enrolled in these studies, those with a positive baseline FDG-PET/CT imaging and focal bone lesions (FLs) and/or extramedullary disease (EMD) were included in the present analysis. A total of 17 image features (visual and quantitative, reflecting whole imaging characteristics) and 5 clinical/histopathological parameters were collected. The statistical analysis was conducted using two RSF approaches (train/validation + test and additional nested cross-validation) to predict progression-free survival (PFS).  Results  One hundred thirty-nine patients were considered for this study. The final model based on the first RSF (train/validation + test) approach selected 3 features (treatment arm, hemoglobin, and SUVmaxBone Marrow (BM)) among the 22 involved initially, and two risk groups of patients (good and poor prognosis) could be defined with a mean hazard ratio of 4.3 ± 1.5 and a mean log-rank p value of 0.01 ± 0.01. The additional RSF (nested cross-validation) analysis highlighted the robustness of the proposed model across different splits of the dataset. Indeed, the first features selected using the train/validation + test approach remained the first ones over the folds with the nested approach.  Conclusion  We proposed a new prognosis model for TEND MM patients at diagnosis based on two RSF approaches.

10.2967/jnumed.120.248674,33037091.0,,Repeatability of Radiomic Features of Brown Adipose Tissue,"The aim of this study was to assess the repeatability of activated brown adipose tissue (BAT) radiomic features. In order to decipher radiomic features that may provide useful information on BAT, the impact of reconstruction methods and imaging modality choice was also evaluated. Methods: Twenty-seven healthy adults enrolled in this study. Following a cooling procedure to activate BAT, volunteers underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission / computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) imaging. Participants underwent repeat imaging using the same imaging protocols and a similar FDG dose within 14 days. Active BAT was segmented using the BARCIST 1.0 methods. Radiomic features were extracted from each region of interest (ROI) on high definition PET (HD PET), non-HD PET, and CT images. Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was used to estimate the repeatability of the extracted radiomic features. To determine whether BAT radiomic feature repeatability correlates with BAT maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) repeatability, participants were stratified based on the relative difference in SUVmax between sessions. Non-HD PET repeatable features were clustered together using hierarchical clustering, and the normalized dynamic range (NDR) of each feature was computed to identify the most informative feature within each cluster. Results: Eighteen of the 27 volunteers had sufficient BAT activity for radiomic analysis. Sixty-six HD PET, 66 non-HD PET, and 6 CT features showed high repeatability (CCC ≥ 0.80). Feature repeatability was significantly higher for PET than for CT, but there was no statistically significant difference between HD and non-HD PET in radiomic feature repeatability. The repeatability of radiomic features extracted from each modality and reconstruction method type followed the trend in SUVmax, as participants with lower relative differences in SUVmax between initial and repeat imaging sessions had higher radiomic feature repeatability. Hierarchical clustering of the high-repeatability PET features resulted in 10 highly correlated clusters (R2 ≥ 0.95). Seven features, including SUVmax, did not cluster with any other features. Conclusion: Several clusters of highly repeatable BAT radiomic features derived from FDG PET/CT appear to provide information regarding BAT activity distinct from SUVmax These features might be explored as quantitative imaging biomarkers of BAT activity in future studies.","Arash Nazeri,Aria Nazeri,Aria Nazeri,John Crandall,Tyler J.

MR images from 87 patients with oropharyngeal SCC (n=68) and lymphoma (n=19) were reviewed retrospectively. Tumors were semi-automatically segmented on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images registered to T2-weighted images, and radiomic features (n=202) were extracted from contrast-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted images. The radiomics classifier was built using elastic-net regularized generalized linear model analyses with nested five-fold cross-validation. The diagnostic abilities of the radiomics classifier and visual assessment by two head and neck radiologists were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses for distinguishing SCC from lymphoma. Nineteen radiomics features were selected at least twice during the five-fold cross-validation. The mean area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the radiomics classifier was 0.750 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.613-0.887], with a sensitivity of 84.2%, specificity of 60.3%, and an accuracy of 65.5%. Two human readers yielded AUCs of 0.613 (95% CI, 0.467-0.759) and 0.663 (95% CI, 0.531-0.795), respectively.

Methods This retrospective study recruited 168 consecutive patients (mean age,53.9 years; range, 28-76 years; 43 women) with T1 ccRCC between January 2012 to June 2019, including 50 aggressive ccRCC based on synchronous metastasis or recurrence after surgery. The patients were divided into two cohorts (training and validation) at a 7:3 ratio. Radiomics features were extracted from contrast enhanced CT images. A radiomics signature was built on the basis of reproducible features by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method. Demographics, laboratory variables (including sex, age, Fuhrman grade, hemoglobin, platelet, neutrophils, albumin and calcium) and CT findings were combined to build clinical factors model. Integrated radiomics signature and independent clinical factors, a radiomics nomogram was constructed. Nomogram performance was determined by calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. Results Ten features were used to build radiomics signature, which yielded area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 in the training cohort and 0.85 in the validation cohort. Radiomics nomogram (AUC: training, 0.91; validation, 0.92) had higher performance than clinical factor model (AUC: training, 0.86 (p= 0.051); validation, 0.90 (p= 0.401)) or radiomics signature as a means of identifying patients at high risk for recurrence and metastasis. The nomogram showed good calibration. Decision curve analysis demonstrated the nomogram outperformed the clinical factors model in terms of clinical usefulness. Conclusion The CT-based radiomics nomogram could help in predicting recurrence and metastasis risk in T1 ccRCC, which might assist clinicians in tailoring precise therapy.","Bing Kang,Bing Kang,Cong Sun,Cong Sun,Hui Gu,Hui Gu,Shifeng Yang,Shifeng Yang,Xin Yuan,Chaonan Ji,Xianshun Yuan,Zhaoqin Huang,Congshan Ji,Zhaoqin Huang,Zhaoqin Huang,Xinxin Yu,Xinxin Yu,Shaofeng Duan,Shaofeng Duan,Ximing Wang,Ximing Wang",Frontiers in Oncology,2020.0
10.3389/fonc.2020.567736,,,The Current State of Radiomics for Meningiomas: Promises and Challenges.,"Meningiomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system. Given the fact that the majority of meningiomas are benign, the preoperative risk stratification and treatment strategy decision-making highly rely on the conventional subjective radiologic evaluation. However, this traditional diagnostic and treatment modality may not be effective in patients with aggressive-growing tumors or symptomatic patients with potential risk of recurrence after surgical resection or radiotherapy, as this passive “wait and see” strategy could miss the optimal opportunity of intervention. Radiomics, a new rising discipline, translates high-dimensional image information into abundant mathematical data by multiple computational algorithms. It provides an objective and quantitative approach to interpret the imaging data, rather than the subjective and qualitative interpretation from relatively limited human visual observation. In fact, the enormous amount of information generated by radiomics analyses provides radiological to histopathological tumor information, which are visually imperceptible, and offers technological basis to its applications amid diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Here, we review the latest advancements of radiomics and its applications in the prediction of the pathological grade, pathological subtype, recurrence possibility, and differential diagnosis of meningiomas, and the potential and challenges in general clinical applications. In this review, we highlight the generalization of shared radiomic features among different studies and compare different performances of popular algorithms. At last, we discuss several possible aspects of challenges and future directions in the development of radiomic applications in meningiomas.","Hongtao Gu,Xu Zhang,Hao Gu,Paolo di Russo,Xu Zhang,Xiaochun Zhao,Paolo di Russo,Tao Xu,Xiaochun Zhao,Tao Xu,Tao Xu",Frontiers in Oncology,2020.0

We aim to evaluate whether radiomics features of CMR cine images vary during the cardiac cycle and investigate the reproducibility of radiomics features of CMR cine images. METHODS This retrospective study enrolled 59 healthy adults who underwent CMR examination. Two observers segmented the myocardium on a 4D stack of three consecutive mid-ventricular short-axis cine images covering the cardiac cycle. A total of 352 radiomics features were extracted. The coefficient of variation and intraclass correlation coefficient were used to assess the feature variability through the cycle and inter-observer reproducibility, respectively. RESULTS Approximately 55% of radiomics features showed large variability through the cardiac cycle. The original features showed more variability than the Laplacian of Gaussian-filtered features (73.8% vs. 48%). The features of 4D stack cine images had a higher proportion of reproducible features (92.0%, 87.7%, and 76.1%) compared with the end-diastolic (77.8%, 62.2%, and 41.7%) and the end-systolic images (81.5%, 74.1%, and 58.8%) for intraclass correlation cut-off values of 30.80, > 0.85, and > 0.90, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Radiomics features of CMR cine images greatly vary during the cardiac cycle. The radiomics features of 4D stack of cine images are more robust compared with end-diastolic and end-systolic cine images in terms of reproducibility. The impact of the cardiac cycle on the reproducibility of the features should be considered when employing CMR cine images radiomics. KEY POINTS • There is limited evidence on the impact of cardiac motion on radiomics features of CMR cine images and the reproducibility of the radiomics features of CMR cine images. • Radiomics features of non-enhanced CMR cine images greatly vary during the cardiac cycle, and the number of ""reproducible"" features shows significant variations according to the cardiac phases. • The impact of cardiac cycle on the reproducibility of the radiomics features should be considered when employing CMR cine images radiomics.","Deniz Aliş,Deniz Alis,Mert Yergin,Ozan Asmakutlu,Mert Yergin,Çağdaş Topel,Ozan Asmakutlu,Ercan Karaarslan,Cagdas Topel,Cagdas Topel,Ercan Karaarslan,Ercan Karaarslan",European Radiology,2020.0

However, hysterectomy can be avoided in patients who can be treated by cone biopsy. Previous studies have shown that imaging-based approaches allow for the noninvasive visualization of cervical cancer, and radiomics has high accuracy in classifying cancer and predicting treatment outcome for different cancer types. To develop a magnetic resonance (MR)-based radiomics model for identifying residual disease in patients with CIS after cervical conization. Patients who had CIS after conization and finally underwent hysterectomy were collected to comprise a database to establish an imaging model for predicting the residual status after conization. Then, patients who opted for uterine preservation were classified as high-risk or low-risk patients according to the model. The disease-free survival was compared between the different risk groups using the Kaplan-Meier curve. The model built with the Boruta features outperformed the random forest model. Further validation with patients with uterine preservation showed that the patients classified as high risk were more likely to have tumor recurrence/residual disease in the follow-up period. In conclusion, radiomics can be used to identify residual disease in patients with CIS after cervical conization and could have the potential to predict recurrence in patients who opt for uterine preservation.","Mengfan Song,Jing Lin,Mengfan Song,Fuzhen Song,Jing Lin,Fuzhen Song,Dan Wu,Dan Wu,Zhaoxia Qian,Zhaoxia Qian",Scientific Reports,2020.0

In this work, we aimed to investigate the potential role of computed tomography (CT) texture analysis in predicting LVI and PNI in patients with tubular gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) using a machine learning (ML) approach. METHODS Sixty-eight patients who underwent total gastrectomy with curative (R0) resection and D2-lymphadenectomy were included in this retrospective study. Texture features were extracted from the portal venous phase CT images. Dimension reduction was first done with a reproducibility analysis by two radiologists. Then, a feature selection algorithm was used to further reduce the high-dimensionality of the radiomic data. Training and test splits were created with 100 random samplings. ML-based classifications were done using adaptive boosting, k-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes, neural network, random forest, stochastic gradient descent, support vector machine, and decision tree. Predictive performance of the ML algorithms was mainly evaluated using the mean area under the curve (AUC) metric. RESULTS Among 271 texture features, 150 features had excellent reproducibility, which were included in the further feature selection process. Dimension reduction steps yielded five texture features for LVI and five for PNI. Considering all eight ML algorithms, mean AUC and accuracy ranges for predicting LVI were 0.777-0.894 and 76%-81.5%, respectively. For predicting PNI, mean AUC and accuracy ranges were 0.482-0.754 and 54%-68.2%, respectively. The best performances for predicting LVI and PNI were achieved with the random forest and Naive Bayes algorithms, respectively. CONCLUSION ML-based CT texture analysis has a potential for predicting LVI and PNI of the tubular GACs. Overall, the method was more successful in predicting LVI than PNI.","Aytül Hande Yardımcı,Burak Koçak,Aytul Hande Yardimci,Burak Koçak,Ceyda Turan Bektaş,Ceyda Turan Bektas,İpek Sel,Burak Kocak,Enver Yarıkkaya,Nevra Dursun,Ceyda Turan Bektas,Enver Yarikkaya,Hasan Bektaş,Ipek Sel,Hasan Bektaş,Çiğdem Usul Afşar,Enver Yarikkaya,Cigdem Usul Afsar,Nevra Dursun,Rıza Umar Gürsu,Hasan Bektaş,Özgür Kılıçkesmez,Cigdem Usul Afsar,Rıza Umar Gürsu,Ozgur Kilickesmez",Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology,2020.0

METHODS A total of 254 patients with a diagnosis of metastatic liver disease were included in this retrospective study. The patients were divided into 3 groups depending on the origin of the primary tumor: group 1 (digestive tract versus non-digestive tract tumors), group 2 (breast cancer versus non-breast cancer), and group 3 (lung cancer versus other malignancies). The patients in each group were allocated to a training or testing set (a ratio of 8:2). The region of interest of liver metastasis was determined through manual differentiation of the tumors, and radiomic signatures were acquired from B-mode US images. Optimal features were selected to develop 3 radiomic models using multiple-dimensionality reduction and classifier screening. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve was applied to assess each model's performance. RESULTS A total of 5936 features were extracted, and 40, 6, and 14 optimal features were sequentially identified for the development of radiomic models for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, with training set AUC values of 0.938, 0.974, and 0.768 and testing set AUC values of 0.767, 0.768, and 0.750.

We aimed to use ultrasound-based radiomics analysis to non-invasively distinguishing histopathological subtypes of primary liver cancer (PLC) before surgery. Methods: We retrospectively analysed ultrasound images of 668 PLC patients, comprising 531 HCC patients, 48 cHCC-ICC patients and 89 ICC patients. The boundary of a tumour was manually determined on the largest imaging slice of the ultrasound medicine image by ITK-SNAP software (version 3.8.0), and then, the high-throughput radiomics features were extracted from the obtained region of interest (ROI) of the tumour. The combination of different dimension-reduction technologies and machine learning approaches were used to identify important features and develop the moderate multi-class radiomics model. The comprehensive ability of the radiomics model by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: After digitally processing tumour ultrasound images, 5,234 high-throughput radiomics features were obtained. We used Spearman+ least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method for feature selection and logistics regression for modelling to develop HCC vs non-HCC radiomics model (composed of 16 features). Spearman +statistical test +random forest methods were used for feature selection and logistics regression were applied for modelling to develop ICC vs cHCC-ICC radiomics model (composed of 19 features). The overall performance of the radiomics model in identifying different histopathological types of PLC was moderate, with AUC values of 0.854 (training cohort) and 0.775 (test cohort) in HCC vs non-HCC radiomics model, and 0.920 (training cohort) and 0.728 (test cohort) in ICC vs cHCC-ICC radiomics model.

All patients were randomised to the training cohort (n = 99) or the validation cohort (n = 55). Pre-treatment contrast-enhanced CT scans were obtained for all patients and used for the extraction of IBMs. An IBM score, was constructed by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with Cox regression analysis, which was equal to the log-partial hazard of the Cox model in the training cohort and tested in the validation cohort. IBM nomograms were built based on IBM scores for individualised survival estimation. Finally, a decision curve analysis was performed to estimate the clinical usefulness of the nomograms.  Results  Altogether, 96 IBMs were extracted from each contrast-enhanced CT scan. IBM scores were constructed from 11 CT-based IBMs for overall survival (OS) and 8 IBMs for progression-free survival (PFS), using the LASSO-Cox regression method in the training cohort. Multivariate analysis revealed that IBM score was an independent prognostic factor correlated with OS and PFS. In the training cohort, the C-indices of IBM scores were 0.734 (95% CI 0.664-0.804) and 0.658 (95% CI 0.587-0.729) for OS and PFS, respectively. In the validation cohort, C-indices were 0.672 (95% CI 0.578-0.766) and 0.666 (95% CI 0.574-0.758) for OS and PFS, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a significant difference between risk subgroups in the training and validation cohorts. Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical usefulness of the IBM score.  Conclusions  The IBM score based on pre-treatment contrast-enhanced CT could predict the OS and PFS for patients with OSCC after definitive CCRT. Further multicentre studies with larger sample sizes are warranted.","Chengbing Zeng,Tian‐Tian Zhai,Chengbing Zeng,Tian-Tian Zhai,Jianzhou Chen,Jianzhou Chen,Jianzhou Chen,Longjia Guo,Jianzhou Chen,Bao-Tian Huang,Long-jia Guo,Hong Guo,Bao-Tian Huang,Guozhi Lv,Hong Guo,Guozhi Liu,Tingting Zhuang,Ting-Ting Zhuang,Weitong Liu,Ting Luo,Weitong Liu,Ting Luo,Yanxuan Wu,Guopeng Peng,Yanxuan Wu,Derui Li,Guobo Peng,Chuangzhen Chen,De-Rui Li,Chuang-Zhen Chen",Radiation Oncology,2021.0

Computed tomography (CT) images of 509 patients manifesting as GGNs were collected: 70% of cases were included in the training cohort and 30% in the validation cohort. The Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy (mRMR) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were used to select the radiomics features and construct a radiomics signature. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to select the invasiveness-related clinical and CT morphological predictors. Age, smoking history, long diameter, and average CT value were retained as independent predictors of GGN invasiveness. A radiomics nomogram was established by integrating clinical and CT morphological features with the radiomics signature. The radiomics nomogram showed good predictive ability in the training set (area under the curve [AUC], 0.940; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.916–0.964) and validation set (AUC, 0.946; 95% CI, 0.907–0.986). This radiomics nomogram may serve as a noninvasive and accurate predictive tool to determine the invasiveness of GGNs prior to surgery and assist clinicians in creating personalized treatment strategies.","Fanyang Meng,Yan Guo,Fanyang Meng,Yan Guo,Mingyang Li,Mingyang Li,Xinwu Lu,Xiaoqian Lu,Shuo Wang,Shuo Wang,Shuo Wang,Shuo Wang,Lei Zhang,Lei Zhang,Hua Zhang,Huimao Zhang,Huimao Zhang",Translational Oncology,2021.0

10.3389/fonc.2020.596013,,,A Novel Nomogram Model Based on Cone-Beam CT Radiomics Analysis Technology for Predicting Radiation Pneumonitis in Esophageal Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy.,"We quantitatively analyzed the characteristics of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) radiomics during radiotherapy (RT), and then built a novel nomogram model integrating clinical features and dosimetric parameters for prediction of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 96 ESCC patients who had complete clinical feature and dosimetric parameter data. CBCT images of each patient in three different time periods of RT were obtained and their images were segmented using both lungs as the region of interest (ROI), and 851 image features were extracted. The least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) was applied to identify candidate radiomics features, and logistic regression analyses were applied to construct the Rad-score. The optimal time period for the Rad-score, clinical features and dosimetric parameters were selected to construct the nomogram model, and then the ROC curve was used to evaluate the prediction capacity of the model. Calibration curves and decision curves were used to demonstrate the discriminatory and clinical benefit ratios, respectively. Results: The V5、 MLD and tumor stage were independent predictors of RP and were finally incorporated into the nomogram. When the three time periods are modeled, the first time period was better than the others. In the primary cohort, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.700 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.568~0.832), and in the independent validation cohort, the AUC was 0.765 (95% CI 0.588~0.941). In the nomogram model that integrates clinical features and dosimetric parameters, the AUC in the primary cohort was 0.836 (95% CI 0.700~0.918), and the AUC in the validation cohort was 0.905 (95% CI 0.799~1.000). The nomogram model shows great performance. Calibration curves indicated a favorable consistency between the nomogram prediction and the actual outcomes. The decision curve exhibited satisfactory clinical utility. Conclusion: The radiomics model based on early lung CBCT is a potentially valuable tool for predicting RP.V5,MLD and tumor stage have certain predictive effects for RP. The developed nomogram model has a better prediction ability than any of the other predictors and can be used as a quantitative model to predict RP.","Feng Du,Feng Du,Feng Du,Ning Tang,Ning Tang,Yuzhong Cui,Wei Wang,Yuzhong Cui,Wei Wang,Yingjie Zhang,Wei Wang,Yingjie Zhang,Zhenxiang Li,Yingjie Zhang,Jianbin Li,Jianbin Li,Zhenxiang Li,Jianbin Li",Frontiers in Oncology,2020.0

This review provides an overview on the value of radiomics in predicting response to treatment in patients with gastrointestinal tumors.  Methods  A systematic review was conducted, according to PRISMA guidelines. The protocol was prospectively registered (PROSPERO: CRD42019128408). PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched. Original studies reporting on the value of radiomics in predicting response to treatment in patients with a gastrointestinal tumor were included. A narrative synthesis of results was conducted. Results were stratified by tumor type. Quality assessment of included studies was performed, according to the radiomics quality score.  Results  The comprehensive literature search identified 1360 unique studies, of which 60 articles were included for analysis. In 37 studies, radiomics models and individual radiomic features showed good predictive performance for response to treatment (area under the curve or accuracy > 0.75). Various strategies to construct predictive models were used. Internal validation of predictive models was often performed, while the majority of studies lacked external validation. None of the studies reported predictive models implemented in clinical practice.  Conclusion  Radiomics is increasingly used to predict response to treatment in patients suffering from gastrointestinal cancer. This review demonstrates its great potential to help predict response to treatment and improve patient selection and early adjustment of treatment strategy in a non-invasive manner.","Nina J.

10.1186/s41824-020-00094-8,,,Artificial intelligence and hybrid imaging: the best match for personalized medicine in oncology,"Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a field of computer science aimed to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. Currently, AI is recognized in the broader technology radar within the five key technologies which emerge for their wide-ranging applications and impact in communities, companies, business, and value chain framework alike. However, AI in medical imaging is at an early phase of development, and there are still hurdles to take related to reliability, user confidence, and adoption. The present narrative review aimed to provide an overview on AI-based approaches (distributed learning, statistical learning, computer-aided diagnosis and detection systems, fully automated image analysis tool, natural language processing) in oncological hybrid medical imaging with respect to clinical tasks (detection, contouring and segmentation, prediction of histology and tumor stage, prediction of mutational status and molecular therapies targets, prediction of treatment response, and outcome). Particularly, AI-based approaches have been briefly described according to their purpose and, finally lung cancer—being one of the most extensively malignancy studied by hybrid medical imaging—has been used as illustrative scenario. Finally, we discussed clinical challenges and open issues including ethics, validation strategies, effective data-sharing methods, regulatory hurdles, educational resources, and strategy to facilitate the interaction among different stakeholders. Some of the major changes in medical imaging will come from the application of AI to workflow and protocols, eventually resulting in improved patient management and quality of life. Overall, several time-consuming tasks could be automatized. Machine learning algorithms and neural networks will permit sophisticated analysis resulting not only in major improvements in disease characterization through imaging, but also in the integration of multiple-omics data (i.e., derived from pathology, genomic, proteomics, and demographics) for multi-dimensional disease featuring. Nevertheless, to accelerate the transition of the theory to practice a sustainable development plan considering the multi-dimensional interactions between professionals, technology, industry, markets, policy, culture, and civil society directed by a mindset which will allow talents to thrive is necessary.","Martina Sollini,Francesco Bartoli,Martina Sollini,Martina Sollini,Andrea Marciano,Francesco Bartoli,Andrea Marciano,Roberta Zanca,Roberta Zanca,Riemer H.

10.1111/ejn.15046,33206423.0,,Baseline structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging predicts early treatment response in schizophrenia,"Multimodal neuroimaging features provide opportunities for accurate classification and personalized treatment options in the psychiatric domain. This study aimed to investigate whether brain features predict responses to the overall treatment of schizophrenia at the end of the first or a single hospitalization. Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from two independent samples (N = 85 and 63, separately) of schizophrenia patients at baseline were included. After treatment, patients were classified as responders and non-responders. Radiomics features of gray matter morphology and functional connectivity were extracted using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. Support vector machine was used to explore the predictive performance. Prediction models were based on structural features (cortical thickness, surface area, gray matter regional volume, mean curvature, metric distortion, and sulcal depth), functional features (functional connectivity), and combined features. There were 12 features after dimensionality reduction. The structural features involved the right precuneus, cuneus, and inferior parietal lobule. The functional features predominately included inter-hemispheric connectivity. We observed a prediction accuracy of 80.38% (sensitivity: 87.28%; specificity 82.47%) for the model using functional features, and 69.68% (sensitivity: 83.96%; specificity: 72.41%) using structural features. Our model combining both structural and functional features achieved a higher accuracy of 85.03%, with 92.04% responder and 80.23% non-responders to the overall treatment to be correctly predicted. These results highlight the power of structural and functional MRI-derived radiomics features to predict early response to treatment in schizophrenia. Prediction models of the very early treatment response in schizophrenia could augment effective therapeutic strategies.","Long‐Biao Cui,Long-Biao Cui,Yu‐Fei Fu,Long-Biao Cui,Long-Biao Cui,Liangxu Lin,Yu-Fei Fu,Lin Liu,Xu‐Sha Wu,Lin Liu,Xu-Sha Wu,Yi‐Bin Xi,Huaning Wang,Yi-Bin Xi,Huaning Wang,Wei Qin,Hong Yin,Wei Qin,Hong Yin",European Journal of Neuroscience,2020.0
10.21037/qims-20-241,,,CT radiomics features to predict lymph node metastasis in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and to discriminate between regional and non-regional lymph node metastasis: a case control study.,"Prediction of lymph node status in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is critical for clinical decision making. In clinical practice, computed tomography (CT) has been frequently used to assist in the preoperative staging of ESCC. Texture analysis can provide more information to reflect potential biological heterogeneity based on CT. A nomogram for the preoperative diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in patients with resectable ESCC has been previously developed. However, to the best of our knowledge, no reports focus on developing CT radiomics features to discriminate ESCC patients with regional lymph node metastasis (RLNM) and non-regional lymph node metastasis (NRLNM). We, therefore, aimed to develop CT radiomics models to predict lymph node metastasis (LNM) in advanced ESCC and to discriminate ESCC between RLNM and NRLNM.This study enrolled 334 patients with pathologically confirmed advanced ESCC, including 152 patients without LNM and 182 patients with LNM, and 103 patients with RLNM and 79 patients NRLNM. Radiomics features were extracted from CT data for each patient. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model and independent samples t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests were exploited for dimension reduction and selection of radiomics features. Optimal radiomics features were chosen using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The discriminating performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy.The radiomics features were developed based on multivariable logistic regression and were significantly associated with LNM status in both the training and validation cohorts (P<0.001). The radiomics models could differentiate between patients with and without LNM (AUC =0.79 and 0.75, and accuracy =0.75 and 0.71 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively). In patients with LNM, the radiomics features could effectively differentiate between RLNM and NRLNM (AUC =0.98 and 0.95, and accuracy =0.94 and 0.83 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively).CT radiomics features could help predict the LNM status of advanced ESCC patients and effectively discriminate ESCC between RLNM and NRLNM.","Jing Ou,Jing Ou,Lun Wu,Lan Wu,Lan Wu,Rui Li,Changqiang Wu,Rui Li,Changqiang Wu,Jun Lee,Jun Liu,Jun Liu,Tianwu Chen,Tian-wu Chen,Xiaoming Zhang,Shengjun Tang,Xiao-Ming Zhang,Yu Wu,Sun Tang,Yu-ping Wu,Yang Long,Li-qin Yang,Bang-guo Tan,Bang-guo Tan,Fulin Lu,Fu-Lin Lu",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,2020.0

Imaging can also reveal intratumoral, intermetastatic, and interpatient heterogeneity, which can be quantified using radiomics. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the plasma is a sensitive and specific biomarker for response monitoring. Here we evaluated the interrelationship between circulating tumor DNA mutant allele fraction (ctDNAmaf), obtained by targeted amplicon sequencing and shallow whole genome sequencing, and radiomic measurements of CT heterogeneity in patients with stage IV melanoma. ctDNAmaf and radiomic observations were obtained from 15 patients with a total of 70 CT examinations acquired as part of a prospective trial. 26 of 39 radiomic features showed a significant relationship with log(ctDNAmaf). Principal component analysis was used to define a radiomics signature that predicted ctDNAmaf independent of lesion volume. This radiomics signature and serum lactate dehydrogenase were independent predictors of ctDNAmaf. Together, these results suggest that radiomic features and ctDNAmaf may serve as complementary clinical tools for treatment monitoring.","Andrew B. Gill,Leonardo Rundo,Andrew B.

10.1109/jbhi.2020.3043236,33290235.0,,Deep Semantic Segmentation Feature-Based Radiomics for the Classification Tasks in Medical Image Analysis,"Recently, an emerging trend in medical image classification is to combine radiomics framework with deep learning classification network in an integrated system. Although this combination is efficient in some tasks, the deep learning-based classification network is often difficult to capture an effective representation of lesion regions, and prone to face the challenge of overfitting, leading to unreliable features and inaccurate results, especially when the sizes of the lesions are small or the training dataset is small. In addition, these combinations mostly lack an effective feature selection mechanism, which makes it difficult to obtain the optimal feature selection. In this paper, we introduce a novel and effective deep semantic segmentation feature-based radiomics (DSFR) framework to overcome the above-mentioned challenges, which consists of two modules: the deep semantic feature extraction module and the feature selection module. Specifically, the extraction module is utilized to extract hierarchical semantic features of the lesions from a trained segmentation network. The feature selection module aims to select the most representative features by using a novel feature similarity adaptation algorithm. Experiments are extensively conducted to evaluate our method in two clinical tasks: the pathological grading prediction in pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (pNENs), and the prediction of thrombolytic therapy efficacy in deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Experimental results on both tasks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin.","Bingsheng Huang,Bingsheng Huang,Jun-Ru Tian,Hongyuan Zhang,Junru Tian,Tian Junru,Zixin Luo,Zhang Hongyuan,Jing Qin,Luo Zixin,Chen Huang,Jing Qin,Chen Huang,Xin He,Huang Chen,He Xueping,Yanji Luo,Yongjin Zhou,Yanji Luo,Yongjin Zhou,Dan Guo,Guo Dan,Hanwei Chen,Hanwei Chen,Chen Hanwei,Shi‐Ting Feng,Shi-Ting Feng,Chenglang Yuan,Yuan Chenglang",IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,2020.0
10.1002/mp.14699,33382467.0,,Detecting MLC modeling errors using radiomics-based machine learning in patient-specific QA with an EPID for intensity-modulated radiation therapy.,"PURPOSE We sought to develop machine learning models to detect multileaf collimator (MLC) modeling errors with the use of radiomic features of fluence maps measured in patient-specific quality assurance (QA) for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with an electric portal imaging device (EPID). METHODS Fluence maps measured with EPID for 38 beams from 19 clinical IMRT plans were assessed. Plans with various degrees of error in MLC modeling parameters (i.e., MLC transmission factor [TF] and dosimetric leaf gap [DLG]) and plans with an MLC positional error for comparison were created. For a total of 152 error plans for each type of error, we calculated fluence difference maps for each beam by subtracting the calculated maps from the measured maps. A total of 837 radiomic features were extracted from each fluence difference map, and we determined the number of features used for the training dataset in the machine learning models by using random forest regression. Machine learning models using the five typical algorithms (decision tree, kNN, SVM, logistic regression, and random forest) for binary classification between the error-free plan and the plan with the corresponding error for each type of error were developed. We used part of the total dataset to perform four-fold cross-validation to tune the models, and we used the remaining test dataset to evaluate the performance of the developed models. A gamma analysis was also performed between the measured and calculated fluence maps with the criteria of 3%/2 mm and 2%/2 mm for all of the types of error. RESULTS The radiomic features and its optimal number were similar for the models for the TF and the DLG error detection, which was different from the MLC positional error. The highest sensitivity was obtained as 0.913 for the TF error with SVM and logistic regression, 0.978 for the DLG error with kNN and SVM, and 1.000 for the MLC positional error with kNN, SVM and random forest. The highest specificity was obtained as 1.000 for the TF error with a decision tree, SVM and logistic regression, 1.000 for the DLG error with a decision tree, logistic regression and random forest, and 0.909 for the MLC positional error with a decision tree and logistic regression. The gamma analysis showed the poorest performance in which sensitivities were 0.737 for the TF error and the DLG error and 0.882 for the MLC positional error for 3%/2 mm. The addition of another type of error to fluence maps significantly reduced the sensitivity for the TF and the DLG error, whereas no effect was observed for the MLC positional error detection. CONCLUSIONS Compared to the conventional gamma analysis, the radiomics-based machine learning models showed higher sensitivity and specificity in detecting a single type of the MLC modeling error and the MLC positional error. Although the developed models need further improvement for detecting multiple types of error, radiomics-based IMRT QA was shown to be a promising approach for detecting the MLC modeling error.","Madoka Sakai,Madoka Sakai,Hisashi Nakano,Hisashi Nakano,Daisuke Kawahara,Daisuke Kawahara,Daisuke Kawahara,Soichi Tanabe,T Takizawa,Satoshi Tanabe,Akihiro Narita,Takeshi Takizawa,Takumi Yamada,Akihiro Narita,Hironori Sakai,Takumi Yamada,Masataka Ueda,Hironori Sakai,Masataka Ueda,Ryuta Sasamoto,Ryuta Sasamoto,Ryuta Sasamoto,Motoki Kaidu,Hidefumi Aoyama,Motoki Kaidu,Hidefumi Aoyama,Hiroyuki Ishikawa,Satoru Utsunomiya,Hiroyuki Ishikawa,Satoru Utsunomiya",Medical Physics,2020.0

Objective  To propose a clinically applicable large-scale bidirectional generative adversarial network for predicting the efficacy of EGFR-TKI therapy in patients with NSCLC.  Design, Setting, and Participants  This diagnostic/prognostic study enrolled 465 patients from January 1, 2010, to August 1, 2017, with follow-up from February 1, 2010, to June 1, 2020. A deep learning (DL) semantic signature to predict progression-free survival (PFS) was constructed in the training cohort, validated in 2 external validation and 2 control cohorts, and compared with the radiomics signature.  Exposures  An end-to-end bidirectional generative adversarial network framework was designed to predict the progression risk in patients with NSCLC.  Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary end point was PFS, considering the time from the initiation of therapy to the date of recurrence, confirmed disease progression, or death.  Results  A total of 342 patients with stage IVEGFRvariant–positive NSCLC receiving EGFR-TKI therapy met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 145 patients from 2 of the hospitals (n=117 and 28) formed a training cohort (mean [SD] age, 61 [11] years; 87 [60.0%] female), and the patients from 2 other hospitals comprised 2 external validation cohorts (validation cohort 1: n=101; mean [SD] age, 57 [12] years; 60 [59.4%] female; and validation cohort 2: n=96, mean [SD] age, 58 [9] years; 55 [57.3%] female). Fifty-six patients with advanced-stageEGFRvariant–positive NSCLC (mean [SD] age, 52 [11] years; 26 [46.4%] female) and 67 patients with advanced-stageEGFRwild-type NSCLC (mean [SD] age, 54 [10] years; 10 [15.0%] female) who received first-line chemotherapy were included. A total of 90 (26%) receiving EGFR-TKI therapy with a high risk of rapid disease progression were identified (median [range] PFS, 7.3 [1.4-32.0] months in the training cohort, 5.0 [0.6-34.6] months in validation cohort 1, and 6.4 [1.8-20.1] months, in validation cohort 2) using the DL semantic signature.The PFS decreased by 36% (hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.30-3.49;P  Conclusions and Relevance  This diagnostic/prognostic study provides a clinically applicable approach for identifying patients with stage IVEGFRvariant–positive NSCLC who are not likely to benefit from EGFR-TKI therapy. The end-to-end DL-derived semantic features eliminated all manual interventions required while using previous radiomics methods and have a better prognostic performance.","Jiangdian Song,Jiangdian Song,Lu Wang,Jiangdian Song,Nathan Ng,Lu Wang,Mingfang Zhao,Nathan N.

10.1117/1.jmi.7.6.064007,,,Effect of an iterative reconstruction quantum noise reduction technique on computed tomography radiomic features.,"Purpose: The goal of this study was to quantify the effects of iterative reconstruction on radiomics features of normal anatomic structures on head and neck computed tomography (CT) scans. Methods: Regions of interest (ROI) containing five different tissue types and an ROI containing only air were extracted from CT scans of the head and neck from 108 patients. Each scan was reconstructed using three different iDose4 reconstruction levels (2, 4, and 6) in addition to bone, thin slice (1-mm slice thickness), and thin-bone reconstructions. From each ROI in all reconstructions, 142 radiomic features were calculated. For each of the six ROIs, features were compared between combinations of iDose levels (2v4, 4v6, and 2v6) with a threshold of α = 0.05 after correcting for multiple comparisons (p < 0.00006). Features from iDose4-2 reconstructions were also compared to bone, thin slice, and thin-bone reconstructions. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, ρ, quantified the relative feature value agreement across iDose4 reconstructions. Results: When comparing radiomics features across the three iDose4 reconstruction levels, over half of all features reflected significant differences for all tissue types, while no features demonstrated significant differences when extracted from air ROIs. When assessing feature value agreement, at least 97% of features reflected excellent agreement (ρ > 0.9) when comparing the three iDose levels for all ROIs. When comparing iDose4-2 to bone, thin slice, and thin-bone reconstructions, more than half of all features demonstrated significant differences for all ROIs and 89 % of features reflected excellent agreement for all ROIs. Conclusion: Many radiomics features are dependent on the iterative reconstruction level, and the magnitude of this dependency is affected by the tissue from which features are extracted. For studies using images reconstructed using varying iDose4 reconstruction levels, features robust to these should be used.","Joseph J. Foy,Mena Shenouda,Joseph J.

Thirty-four patients (isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastoma, 94%) with progressive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes according to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria within the first 12 weeks after completing temozolomide chemoradiation underwent a dynamic FET PET scan. Static and dynamic FET PET parameters were calculated. For radiomics analysis, the number of datasets was increased to 102 using data augmentation. After randomly assigning patients to a training and test dataset, 944 features were calculated on unfiltered and filtered images. The number of features for model generation was limited to four to avoid data overfitting. Eighteen patients were diagnosed with early tumor progression, and 16 patients had pseudoprogression. The FET PET radiomics model correctly diagnosed pseudoprogression in all test cohort patients (sensitivity, 100%; negative predictive value, 100%). In contrast, the diagnostic performance of the best FET PET parameter (TBRmax) was lower (sensitivity, 81%; negative predictive value, 80%). The results suggest that FET PET radiomics helps diagnose patients with pseudoprogression with a high diagnostic performance. Given the clinical significance, further studies are warranted.","Philipp Lohmann,Mai Amr Elahmadawy,Philipp Lohmann,Robin Gutsche,Mai A Elahmadawy,Mai A.

10.3390/cancers12123663,33297357.0,,Identifying Cross-Scale Associations between Radiomic and Pathomic Signatures of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Subtypes: Preliminary Results.,"(1) Background: Despite the complementarity between radiology and histopathology, both from a diagnostic and a prognostic perspective, quantitative analyses of these modalities are usually performed in disconnected silos. This work presents initial results for differentiating two major non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtypes by exploring cross-scale associations between Computed Tomography (CT) images and corresponding digitized pathology images. (2) Methods: The analysis comprised three phases, (i) a multi-resolution cell density quantification to identify discriminant pathomic patterns for differentiating adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), (ii) radiomic characterization of CT images by using Haralick descriptors to quantify tumor textural heterogeneity as represented by gray-level co-occurrences to discriminate the two pathological subtypes, and (iii) quantitative correlation analysis between the multi-modal features to identify potential associations between them. This analysis was carried out using two publicly available digitized pathology databases (117 cases from TCGA and 54 cases from CPTAC) and a public radiological collection of CT images (101 cases from NSCLC-R). (3) Results: The top-ranked cell density pathomic features from the histopathology analysis were correlation, contrast, homogeneity, sum of entropy and difference of variance; which yielded a cross-validated AUC of 0.72 ± 0.02 on the training set (CPTAC) and hold-out validation AUC of 0.77 on the testing set (TCGA). Top-ranked co-occurrence radiomic features within NSCLC-R were contrast, correlation and sum of entropy which yielded a cross-validated AUC of 0.72 ± 0.01. Preliminary but significant cross-scale associations were identified between cell density statistics and CT intensity values using matched specimens available in the TCGA cohort, which were used to significantly improve the overall discriminatory performance of radiomic features in differentiating NSCLC subtypes (AUC = 0.78 ± 0.01). (4) Conclusions: Initial results suggest that cross-scale associations may exist between digital pathology and CT imaging which can be used to identify relevant radiomic and histopathology features to accurately distinguish lung adenocarcinomas from squamous cell carcinomas.","Charlems Alvarez-Jimenez,Charlems Alvarez-Jimenez,Álvaro Andrés Sandino,Prateek Prasanna,Alvaro Andrés.

10.1186/s41747-020-00189-8,33169295.0,,Impact of inter-reader contouring variability on textural radiomics of colorectal liver metastases,"BACKGROUND Radiomics is expected to improve the management of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). We aimed at evaluating the impact of liver lesion contouring as a source of variability on radiomic features (RFs). METHODS After Ethics Committee approval, 70 liver metastases in 17 CRC patients were segmented on contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans by two residents and checked by experienced radiologists. RFs from grey level co-occurrence and run length matrices were extracted from three-dimensional (3D) regions of interest (ROIs) and the largest two-dimensional (2D) ROIs. Inter-reader variability was evaluated with Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance, whilst its impact on RFs was assessed using mean relative change (MRC) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). For the main lesion of each patient, one reader also segmented a circular ROI on the same image used for the 2D ROI. RESULTS The best inter-reader contouring agreement was observed for 2D ROIs according to both Dice coefficient (median 0.85, interquartile range 0.78-0.89) and Hausdorff distance (0.21mm, 0.14-0.31mm). Comparing RF values, MRC ranged 0-752% for 2D and 0-1567% for 3D. For 24/32 RFs (75%), MRC was lower for 2D than for 3D. An ICC > 0.90 was observed for more RFs for 2D (53%) than for 3D (34%). Only 2/32 RFs (6%) showed a variability between 2D and circular ROIs higher than inter-reader variability. CONCLUSIONS A 2D contouring approach may help mitigate overall inter-reader variability, albeit stable RFs can be extracted from both 3D and 2D segmentations of CRC liver metastases.","Francesco Rizzetto,F.

10.1016/j.semcancer.2020.12.005,33290844.0,,Integrated imaging and molecular analysis to decipher tumor microenvironment in the era of immunotherapy,"Abstract   Radiological imaging is an integral component of cancer care, including diagnosis, staging, and treatment response monitoring. It contains rich information about tumor phenotypes that are governed not only by cancer cell-intrinsic biological processes but also by the tumor microenvironment, such as the composition and function of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. By analyzing the radiological scans using a quantitative radiomics approach, robust relations between specific imaging and molecular phenotypes can be established. Indeed, a number of studies have demonstrated the feasibility of radiogenomics for predicting intrinsic molecular subtypes and gene expression signatures in breast cancer based on MRI. In parallel, promising results have been shown for inferring the amount of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, a key factor for the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, from standard-of-care radiological images. Compared with the biopsy-based approach, radiogenomics offers a unique avenue to profile the molecular makeup of the tumor and immune microenvironment as well as its evolution in a noninvasive and holistic manner through longitudinal imaging scans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the state of the art radiogenomics studies in the era of immunotherapy and discuss emerging paradigms and opportunities in AI and deep learning approaches. These technical advances are expected to transform the radiogenomics field, leading to the discovery of reliable imaging biomarkers. This will pave the way for their clinical translation to guide precision cancer therapy.","Jia Wu,Jia Wu,Jia Wu,Jia Wu,Aaron T. Mayer,Aaron T. Mayer,Ruijiang Li,Aaron T.

10.3389/fonc.2020.552270,,,Intratumoral and Peritumoral Radiomics of Contrast-Enhanced CT for Prediction of Disease-Free Survival and Chemotherapy Response in Stage II/III Gastric Cancer.,"Background We evaluated the ability of radiomics based on intratumoral and peritumoral regions on preoperative gastric cancer (GC) contrast-enhanced CT imaging to predict disease-free survival (DFS) and chemotherapy response in stage II/III GC. Methods This study enrolled of 739 consecutive stage II/III GC patients. Within the intratumoral and peritumoral regions of CT images, 584 total radiomic features were computed at the portal venous-phase. A radiomics signature (RS) was generated by using support vector machine (SVM) based methods. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to determine the association of the RS and clinicopathological variables with DFS. A radiomics nomogram combining the radiomics signature and clinicopathological findings was constructed for individualized DFS estimation. Results The radiomics signature consisted of 26 features and was significantly associated with DFS in both the training and validation sets (both P<0.0001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the radiomics signature was an independent prognostic factor. The signature had higher predictive accuracy than TNM stage and single radiomics features and clinicopathological factors. Further analysis revealed that stage II/III GC patients with high scores were likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusion The newly developed radiomics signature is a powerful predictor of DFS, and it may predict which stage II and III GC patients benefit from chemotherapy.","Junmeng Li,Chao Zhang,Junmeng Li,Jia Wei,Chao Zhang,Jia Wei,Peiming Zheng,Peiming Zheng,Hui Zhang,Xingwen Yi,Hui Zhang,Junwei Bai,Yi Xie,Junwei Bai,Zhongqi Zhu,Zhonglin Zhu,Kangneng Zhou,Kangneng Zhou,Xiaokun Liang,Kangneng Zhou,Xiaokun Liang,Yaoqin Xie,Tao Qin,Yaoqin Xie,Tao Qin",Frontiers in Oncology,2020.0

We explore the predictive value of 2-[18F]FDG uptake with regard to the KRAS mutational status of colorectal adenocarcinoma liver metastases (CLM). METHODS 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT images, surgical pathology and molecular diagnostic reports of 37 patients who underwent PET/CT-guided biopsy of CLM were reviewed under an IRB-approved retrospective research protocol. Sixty CLM in 39 interventional PET scans of the 37 patients were segmented using two different auto-segmentation tools implemented in different commercially available software packages. PET standard uptake values (SUV) were corrected for: (1) partial volume effect (PVE) using cold wall-corrected contrast recovery coefficients derived from phantom spheres with variable diameter and (2) variability of arterial tracer supply and variability of uptake time after injection until start of PET scan derived from the tumor-to-blood standard uptake ratio (SUR) approach. The correlations between the KRAS mutational status and the mean, peak and maximum SUV were investigated using Student's t test, Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction, logistic regression and receiver operation characteristic (ROC) analysis. These correlation analyses were also performed for the ratios of the mean, peak and maximum tumor uptake to the mean blood activity concentration at the time of scan: SURMEAN, SURPEAK and SURMAX, respectively. RESULTS Fifteen patients harbored KRAS missense mutations (KRAS+), while another 3 harbored KRAS gene amplification. For 31 lesions, the mutational status was derived from the PET/CT-guided biopsy. The Student's t test p values for separating KRAS mutant cases decreased after applying PVE correction to all uptake metrics of each lesion and when applying correction for uptake time variability to the SUR metrics. The observed correlations were strongest when both corrections were applied to SURMAX and when the patients harboring gene amplification were grouped with the wild type: p≤0.001; ROC area under the curve=0.77 and 0.75 for the two different segmentations, respectively, with a mean specificity of 0.69 and sensitivity of 0.85. CONCLUSION The correlations observed after applying the described corrections show potential for assigning probabilities for the KRAS missense mutation status in CLM using 2-[18F]FDG PET images.","Marko Popović,M.

Quantification of ER risk is difficult and a reliable prognostic prediction tool is absent. We developed and validated a multilevel model, integrating clinicopathology, molecular pathology and radiology, especially radiomics coupled with machine-learning algorithms, to predict the ER of patients after curative resection in PHC.  Methods  In total, 274 patients who underwent contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) and curative resection at 2-institutions were retrospectively identified and randomly divided into training (n=167), internal validation (n=70), and external validation (n=37) sets. A machine-learning analysis of 18,120 radiomic features based on multi-phase CECT and 48 clinico-radiologic characteristics was performed for the multilevel model.  Results  Comprehensively, 7 independent factors (tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, preoperative CA19-9 level, enhancement pattern, A-Shrink score, V-Shrink score, P-Shrink score) were built to the multilevel model and quantified the risk of ER. We benchmarked the gain in discrimination with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.883, superior to the rival clinical and radiomic models (AUCs 0.792-0.805). The accuracy (ACC) of the multilevel model was 0.826, which was significantly higher than those of the conventional staging systems (AJCC 8th (0.641), MSKCC (0.617), and Gazzaniga (0.581)).  Conclusion  The radiomics-based multilevel model demonstrated superior performance to rival models and conventional staging systems, and could serve as a visual prognostic tool to plan surveillance of ER and guide postoperative individualized management in PHC.","Qin Huan,Xianling Hu,Huan Qin,Junfeng Zhang,Xianling Hu,Junfeng Zhang,Hai-Su Dai,Haisu Dai,Yonggang He,Yonggang He,Zhiping Zhao,Zhiping Zhao,Jiali Yang,Z.

10.1002/mp.14610,33232521.0,,Multi-marker quantitative radiomics for mass characterization in dedicated breast CT imaging,"PURPOSE To develop and evaluate the diagnostic performance of an algorithm for multi-marker radiomic-based classification of breast masses in dedicated breast CT (bCT) images. METHODS Over 1,000 radiomic descriptors aimed at quantifying mass and border heterogeneity, morphology, and margin sharpness were developed and implemented. These included well-established texture and shape feature descriptors, which were supplemented with additional approaches for contour irregularity quantification, spicule and lobe detection, characterization of degree of infiltration, and differences in peritumoral compartments. All descriptors were extracted from a training set of 202 bCT masses (133 benign, 69 malignant), and their individual diagnostic performance was investigated in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) of single-feature-based linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers. Subsequently, the most relevant descriptors were selected through a multiple-step feature selection process (including stability analysis, statistical significance, evaluation of feature interaction, and dimensionality reduction), and used to develop a final LDA radiomic model for classification of benign and malignant masses, which was then tested on an independent test set of 82 cases (45 benign, 37 malignant). RESULTS The majority of the individual radiomic descriptors showed, on the training set, an AUC value deriving from a linear decision boundary higher than 0.65, with the lower limit of the associated 95% confidence interval (C.I.) not overlapping with random chance (AUC = 0.5). The final LDA radiomic model resulted in a test set AUC of 0.90 (95% C.I. 0.80 - 0.96). CONCLUSIONS The proposed multi-marker radiomic approach achieved high diagnostic accuracy in bCT mass classification, using a radiomic signature based on different feature types. While future studies with larger datasets are needed to further validate these results, quantitative radiomics applied to bCT shows potential to improve the breast cancer diagnosis pipeline.","Marco Caballo,Marco Caballo,Domenico R.

This has led to research into noninvasively correlating imaging features (""radiomics"") with genetic status. PURPOSE Our aim was to perform a diagnostic test accuracy systematic review for classifying IDH and 1p19q status using MR imaging radiomics, to provide future directions for integration into clinical radiology. DATA SOURCES Ovid (MEDLINE), Scopus, and the Web of Science were searched in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Diagnostic Test Accuracy guidelines. STUDY SELECTION Fourteen journal articles were selected that included 1655 lower-grade gliomas classified by their IDH and/or 1p19q status from MR imaging radiomic features. DATA ANALYSIS For each article, the classification of IDH and/or 1p19q status using MR imaging radiomics was evaluated using the area under curve or descriptive statistics. Quality assessment was performed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool and the radiomics quality score. DATA SYNTHESIS The best classifier of IDH status was with conventional radiomics in combination with convolutional neural network-derived features (area under the curve = 0.95, 94.4% sensitivity, 86.7% specificity). Optimal classification of 1p19q status occurred with texture-based radiomics (area under the curve = 0.96, 90% sensitivity, 89% specificity). LIMITATIONS A meta-analysis showed high heterogeneity due to the uniqueness of radiomic pipelines. CONCLUSIONS Radiogenomics is a potential alternative to standard invasive biopsy techniques for determination of IDH and 1p19q status in lower-grade gliomas but requires translational research for clinical uptake.","Abhishta Bhandari,Abhishta Bhandari,Rebecca Liong,Rebecca Liong,A.P.

METHODS We analysed 68 patients with oesophageal cancer treated with NACRT followed by esophagectomy, who had staging 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) scans performed at our institution. An in-house data-characterization algorithm was used to extract 3D-radiomic features from the segmented primary disease. Prediction models were constructed and internally validated. Composite feature, Fc =α*FPET +(1-α)*FCT , 0≤α≤1, was constructed for each corresponding CT and PET feature. Loco-regional control (LRC), recurrence-free survival (RFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and compared using log-rank test. RESULTS Median follow-up was 59months. pCR was achieved in 34 (50%) patients. Five-year RFS, LRC, MFS and OS were 67.1%, 88.5%, 75.6% and 57.6%, respectively. Tumour Regression Grade (TRG) 0-1 indicative of complete response or minimal residual disease was significantly associated with improved 5-year LRC [93.7% vs 71.8%; P=0.020; HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.85]. Four separate pCR predictive models were built for CT alone, PET alone, CT+PET and composite. CT, PET and CT+PET models had AUC 0.73±0.08, 0.66±0.08 and 0.77±0.07, respectively. The composite model resulted in an improvement of pCR predicting power with AUC 0.87±0.06. Stratifying patients with a low versus high radiomic score showed clinically relevant improvement in 5-year LRC favouring low-score group (91.1% vs. 80%, 95% CI 0.09-1.77, P=0.2). CONCLUSION The composite CT/PET radiomics model was highly predictive of pCR following NACRT.

10.1002/cam4.3634,,,Quantitative ultrasound radiomics in predicting recurrence for patients with node-positive head-neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with radical radiotherapy.,"This prospective study was conducted to investigate the role of quantitative ultrasound (QUS) radiomics in predicting recurrence for patients with node-positive head-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with radical radiotherapy (RT). The most prominent cervical lymph node (LN) was scanned with a clinical ultrasound device having central frequency of 6.5 MHz. Ultrasound radiofrequency data were processed to obtain 7 QUS parameters. Color-coded parametric maps were generated based on individual QUS spectral features corresponding to each of the smaller units. A total of 31 (7 primary QUS and 24 texture) features were obtained before treatment. All patients were treated with radical RT and followed according to standard institutional practice. Recurrence (local, regional, or distant) served as an endpoint. Three different machine learning classifiers with a set of maximally three features were used for model development and tested with leave-one-out cross-validation for nonrecurrence and recurrence groups. Fifty-one patients were included, with a median follow up of 38 months (range 7–64 months). Recurrence was observed in 17 patients. The best results were obtained using a k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier with a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and an area under curve of 76%, 71%, 75%, and 0.74, respectively. All the three features selected for the KNN model were texture features. The KNN-model-predicted 3-year recurrence-free survival was 81% and 40% in the predicted no-recurrence and predicted-recurrence groups, respectively. (p = 0.001).

10.3389/fonc.2020.578895,,,Radiomics Feature Activation Maps as a New Tool for Signature Interpretability.,"In the field of personalized medicine, radiomics has shown its potential to support treatment decisions. However, the limited feature interpretability hampers its introduction into the clinics. Here, we propose a new methodology to create radiomics feature activation maps, which allows to identify the spatial-anatomical locations responsible for signature activation based on local radiomics. The feasibility of this technique will be studied for histological subtype differentiation (adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using computed tomography (CT) radiomics.Pre-treatment CT scans were collected from a multi-centric Swiss trial (training, n=73, IIIA/N2 NSCLC, SAKK 16/00) and an independent cohort (validation, n=32, IIIA/N2/IIIB NSCLC). Based on the gross tumor volume (GTV), four peritumoral region of interests (ROI) were defined: lung_exterior (expansion into the lung), iso_exterior (expansion into lung and soft tissue), gradient (GTV border region), GTV+Rim (GTV and iso_exterior). For each ROI, 154 radiomic features were extracted using an in-house developed software implementation (Z-Rad, Python v2.7.14). Features robust against delineation variability served as an input for a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Model performance was quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and verified using five-fold cross validation and internal validation. Local radiomic features were extracted from the GTV+Rim ROI using non-overlapping 3x3x3 voxel patches previously marked as GTV or rim. A binary activation map was created for each patient using the median global feature value from the training. The ratios of activated/non-activated patches of GTV and rim regions were compared between histological subtypes (Wilcoxon test).Iso_exterior, gradient, GTV+Rim showed good performances for histological subtype prediction (AUCtraining=0.68-0.72 and AUCvalidation=0.73-0.74) whereas GTV and lung_exterior models failed validation. GTV+Rim model feature activation maps showed that local texture feature distribution differed significantly between histological subtypes in the rim (p=0.0481) but not in the GTV (p=0.461).In this exploratory study, radiomics-based prediction of NSCLC histological subtypes was predominantly based on the peritumoral region indicating that radiomics activation maps can be useful for tracing back the spatial location of regions responsible for signature activation.","Diem Vuong,Stephanie Tanadini‐Lang,Diem Vuong,Ze Wu,Stephanie Tanadini-Lang,Robert J.

It identifies tumor heterogeneity in a comprehensive and noninvasive way, reflecting the biological behaviour of lesions, and thus assists in clinical diagnosis and treatment evaluation. This review describes the radiomics approach and its uses in the evaluation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This discipline holds the potential to characterize lesions more accurately, assesses the primary tumour and predicts the response to therapy and prognosis in PDAC. Existing studies have provided significant insights into the application of radiomics in managing the PDAC. However, a variety of challenges, including data quality and quantity, imaging segmentation, and the standardization of the radiomics process need to be solved before its widespread clinical implementation.","Mingguang He,Ming He,Huadan Xue,Huadan Xue,Zhengyu Jin,Zhengyu Jin",,2020.0

However, most SCNs were constructed by the unitary marker, which was insensitive for the different disease phases. The aim of this study is to devise a novel regional radiomics similarity network (R2SN) that could provide more comprehensive information in morphological network analysis.  MethodsRegional radiomics similarity network (R2SN) was constructed by computing the Pearson correlations between the radiomics features extracted from any pair of regions for each subject. We further assessed the small-world property of R2SN using the graph theory method, as well as the reproducibility in the different datasets and the reliability with test-retest analysis. The relationship between the R2SN and inter-regional co-expression of gene enriched was also explored, as well as the relationship with general intelligence.  ResultsThe R2SN can be replicated in different datasets, also regardless of using different feature subsets. The R2SN showed high reliability with the test-retest analysis (ICC>0.7). Besides, the small-word property ({sigma}>2) and the high correlation with the gene expression (R=0.24, P<0.001) and the general intelligence was found by R2SN.  ConclusionR2SN provides a novel, reliable, and biologically plausible method to understand human morphological covariance based on structural MRI.  Impact StatementImaging biomarkers are the cornerstone of modern radiology, and the development of valid biomarkers is crucial for optimizing individualized prediction in neurological disorders like AD. Thus, the development of the data mining method from neuroimaging is crucial for adding the biomarkers of disease. This study confirmed that R2SN provides a novel, robust and biologically plausible model and a new perspective for understanding the human brain, therefore. Thus, the R2SN has great promise in further study.","Kun Zhao,Kun Zhao,Kun Zhao,Qiang Zheng,Tongtong Che,Tongtong Che,Dyrba Martin,Martin Dyrba,Qiongling Li,Yanhui Ding,Yuanjie Zheng,Yuanjie Zheng,Yuanjie Zheng,Yong Liu,Yong Liu,Yong Liu,Shuyu Li",bioRxiv,2020.0
10.3389/fcvm.2020.586236,,,Repeatability of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Radiomics: A Multi-Centre Multi-Vendor Test-Retest Study.,"Aims: To evaluate the repeatability of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) radiomics features on test-retest scanning using a multi-centre multi-vendor dataset with a varied case-mix. Methods and Results: The sample included 54 test-retest studies from the VOLUMES resource (thevolumesresource.com). Images were segmented according to a pre-defined protocol to select three regions of interest (ROI) in end-diastole and end-systole: right ventricular blood pool, left ventricular (LV) blood pool and LV myocardium. We extracted radiomics shape features from all three ROIs and, additionally, first-order and texture features from the LV myocardium. Overall, 280 features were derived per study. For each feature, we calculated intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), within-subject coefficient of variation, and mean relative difference. We ranked robustness of features according to mean ICC stratified by feature category, ROI, and cardiac phase, demonstrating a wide range of repeatability. There were features with good and excellent repeatability (ICC ≥ 0.75) within all feature categories and ROIs. A high proportion of first-order and texture features had excellent repeatability (ICC ≥ 0.90), however, these categories also contained features with the poorest repeatability (ICC <0.50). Conclusion: CMR radiomic features have a wide range of repeatability. This paper is intended as a reference for future researchers to guide selection of the most robust features for clinical CMR radiomics models. Further work in larger and richer datasets is needed to further define the technical performance and clinical utility of CMR radiomics.","Zahra Raisi‐Estabragh,Polyxeni Gkontra,Zahra Raisi-Estabragh,Akshay Jaggi,Polyxeni Gkontra,Polyxeni Gkontra,Akshay Jaggi,Jackie A.

10.1002/mp.14590,33169367.0,,Technical Note: ROdiomiX: A validated software for radiomics analysis of medical images in radiation oncology,"PURPOSE This study introduces an in-house-designed software platform (ROdiomX) for the radiomics analysis of medical images in radiation oncology. ROdiomX is a MATLAB-based framework for the computation of radiomic features and feature aggregation techniques in compliance with the Image-Biomarker-Standardization-Initiative (IBSI) guidelines, which includes pre-processing protocols and quantitative benchmark results for analysis of computational phantom images. METHODS AND MATERIALS The ROdiomX software system consists of a series of computation cores implemented on the basis of the guidelines proposed by the IBSI. It is capable of quantitative computation of the following 11 different feature categories: Local-Intensity, Intensity-Histogram, Intensity-Based-Statistical, Intensity-Volume-Histogram, Gray-Level-Co-occurrence, Gray-Level-Run-Length, Gray-Level-Size-Zone, Gray-Level-Distance-Zone, Neighborhood-Grey-Tone-Difference, Neighboring-Grey-Level-Dependence, and Morphological feature. ROdiomX was validated against benchmark values for the IBSI 3D digital phantom, as well as one designed in-house (HFH). The Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for estimating the degree of absolute agreement between ROdiomX computation and benchmark values for different features at the 95% confidence level (CL) was used for comparison. RESULTS Among the 11 feature categories with 151 total features including 10 different feature aggregation methods (following the IBSI guidelines), the percent difference between absolute feature values computed by the ROdiomX software and benchmark values reported for IBSI and HFH digital phantoms were 0.14% ± 0.43% and 0.11% ± 0.27% respectively. The ICC values were ≥0.997 for all ten feature categories for both the IBSI and HFH digital phantoms. CONCLUSION The authors successfully developed a platform for computation of quantitative radiomic features. The image preprocessing and computational software cores were designed following the procedures specified by the IBSI. Benchmarking testing was in excellent agreement against the IBSI and HFH-designed computational phantoms.","Hassan Bagher‐Ebadian,Indrin J. Chetty,Hassan Bagher-Ebadian,Indrin J.

10.1055/a-1244-2775,33242898.0,,The International Radiomics Platform - An Initiative of the German and Austrian Radiological Societies - First Application Examples.,"PurposeThe DRG-ORG IRP (Deutsche Rontgengesellschaft-Osterreichische Rontgengesellschaft international radiomics platform) represents a web-/cloud-based radiomics platform based on a public-private partnership.It offers the possibility of data sharing, annotation, validation and certification in the field of artificial intelligence, radiomics analysis, and integrated diagnostics. In a first proof-of-concept study, automated myocardial segmentation and automated myocardial late gadolinum enhancement (LGE) detection using radiomic image features will be evaluated for myocarditis data sets.     Materials and MethodsThe DRG-ORP IRP can be used to create quality-assured, structured image data in combination with clinical data and subsequent integrated data analysis and is characterized by the following performance criteria: Possibility of using multicentric networked data, automatically calculated quality parameters, processing of annotation tasks, contour recognition using conventional and artificial intelligence methods and the possibility of targeted integration of algorithms. In a first study, a neural network pre-trained using cardiac CINE data sets was evaluated for segmentation of PSIR data sets. In a second step, radiomic features were applied for segmental detection of LGE of the same data sets, which were provided multicenter via the IRP.     ResultsFirst results show the advantages (data transparency, reliability, broad involvement of all members, continuous evolution as well as validation and certification) of this platform-based approach. In the proof-of-concept study, the neural network demonstrated a Dice coefficient of 0.813 compared to the expert's segmentation of the myocardium. In the segment-based myocardial LGE detection, the AUC was 0.73 and 0.79 after exclusion of segments with uncertain annotation.   The evaluation and provision of the data takes place at the IRP, taking into account the FAT (fairness, accountability, transparency) and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) criteria.     ConclusionIt could be shown that the DRG-ORP IRP can be used as a crystallization point for the generation of further individual and joint projects. The execution of quantitative analyses with artificial intelligence methods is greatly facilitated by the platform approach of the DRG-ORP IRP, since pre-trained neural networks can be integrated and scientific groups can be networked.   In a first proof-of-concept study on automated segmentation of the myocardium and automated myocardial LGE detection, these advantages were successfully applied.   Our study shows that with the DRG-ORP IRP, strategic goals can be implemented in an interdisciplinary way, that concrete proof-of-concept examples can be demonstrated, and that a large number of individual and joint projects can be realized in a participatory way involving all groups.

10.1038/s41598-020-76310-z,33184313.0,,The importance of feature aggregation in radiomics: a head and neck cancer study.,"In standard radiomics studies the features extracted from clinical images are mostly quantified with simple statistics such as the average or variance per Region of Interest (ROI). Such approaches may smooth out any intra-region heterogeneity and thus hide some tumor aggressiveness that may hamper predictions. In this paper we study the importance of feature aggregation within the standard radiomics workflow, which allows to take into account intra-region variations. Feature aggregation methods transform a collection of voxel values from feature response maps (over a ROI) into one or several scalar values that are usable for statistical or machine learning algorithms. This important step has been little investigated within the radiomics workflows, so far. In this paper, we compare several aggregation methods with standard radiomics approaches in order to assess the improvements in prediction capabilities. We evaluate the performance using an aggregation function based on Bags of Visual Words (BoVW), which allows for the preservation of piece-wise homogeneous information within heterogeneous regions and compared with standard methods. The different models are compared on a cohort of 214 head and neck cancer patients coming from 4 medical centers. Radiomics features were extracted from manually delineated tumors in clinical PET-FDG and CT images were analyzed. We compared the performance of standard radiomics models, the volume of the ROI alone and the BoVW model for survival analysis. The average concordance index was estimated with a five fold cross-validation. The performance was significantly better using the BoVW model 0.627 (95% CI: 0.616-0.637) as compared to standard radiomics0.505 (95% CI: 0.499-0.511), mean-var. 0.543 (95% CI: 0.536-0.549), mean0.547 (95% CI: 0.541-0.554), var.0.530 (95% CI: 0.524-0.536) or volume 0.577 (95% CI: 0.571-0.582). We conclude that classical aggregation methods are not optimal in case of heterogeneous tumors. We also showed that the BoVW model is a better alternative to extract consistent features in the presence of lesions composed of heterogeneous tissue.","Pierre Fontaine,Pierre Fontaine,Oscar Acosta,Pierre Fontaine,Oscar Acosta,J.

10.1186/s40658-020-00340-9,33296050.0,,Tumor response prediction in 90Y radioembolization with PET-based radiomics features and absorbed dose metrics.,"PURPOSE To evaluate whether lesion radiomics features and absorbed dose metrics extracted from post-therapy 90Y PET can be integrated to better predict outcomes in microsphere radioembolization of liver malignancies METHODS: Given the noisy nature of 90Y PET, first, a liver phantom study with repeated acquisitions and varying reconstruction parameters was used to identify a subset of robust radiomics features for the patient analysis. In 36 radioembolization procedures, 90Y PET/CT was performed within a couple of hours to extract 46 radiomics features and estimate absorbed dose in 105 primary and metastatic liver lesions. Robust radiomics modeling was based on bootstrapped multivariate logistic regression with shrinkage regularization (LASSO) and Cox regression with LASSO. Nested cross-validation and bootstrap resampling were used for optimal parameter/feature selection and for guarding against overfitting risks. Spearman rank correlation was used to analyze feature associations. Area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) was used for lesion response (at first follow-up) analysis while Kaplan-Meier plots and c-index were used to assess progression model performance. Models with absorbed dose only, radiomics only, and combined models were developed to predict lesion outcome. RESULTS The phantom study identified 15/46 reproducible and robust radiomics features that were subsequently used in the patient models. A lesion response model with zone percentage (ZP) and mean absorbed dose achieved an AUC of 0.729 (95% CI 0.702-0.758), and a progression model with zone size nonuniformity (ZSN) and absorbed dose achieved a c-index of 0.803 (95% CI 0.790-0.815) on nested cross-validation (CV). Although the combined models outperformed the radiomics only and absorbed dose only models, statistical significance was not achieved with the current limited data set to establish expected superiority. CONCLUSION We have developed new lesion-level response and progression models using textural radiomics features, derived from 90Y PET combined with mean absorbed dose for predicting outcome in radioembolization. These encouraging, but limited results, will need further validation in independent and larger datasets prior to any clinical adoption.","Lin-Hung Wei,Can Cui,Lise Wei,Can Cui,Xu Jiarui,Jiarui Xu,Ravi K.

10.3389/fmed.2020.601853,,,68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT-Based Radiomic Analysis and PRRT Outcome: A Preliminary Evaluation Based on an Exploratory Radiomic Analysis on Two Patients.,"Aim: To evaluate whether radiomic features extracted by 68Ga-DOTATOC-PET/CT of two patients are associated with the response to peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in patients affected by neuroendocrine tumor (NET). Methods: This is a pilot report in two NET patients who experienced discordant response to PRRT (responder vs. non-responder), according to RECIST1.1. Patients presented with liver metastasis from rectum and pancreas G3-NET, respectively. Whole-body total-lesion somatostatin receptor-expression (TLSREwb-50) and somatostatin receptor-expressing tumor volume (SRETV wb-50) were obtained in pre- and post-PRRT PET/CT. Radiomic analysis was performed extracting 38 radiomic features (RFs) from the patients’ lesions. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare RFs in the responder patient vs. non-responder patient. Pearson correlation and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were used to evaluate the correlation and independence of the different RFs. Results: TLSREwb-50 and SRETVwb-50 modifications correlate with RECIST1.1 response. 28 RFs extracted on the pre-therapy PET/CT showed significant differences among the two patients in the Mann Whitney test (p < 0.05). A total of seven second-order features, with poor correlation with SUVmax and PET volume, were identified by the Pearson correlation matrix. Finally, the first two PCA principal components (PCs) explain 83.8% of total variance. Conclusion: TLSREwb-50 and SRETVwb-50 are parameters that might be used to predict and to assess the PET-response to PRRT. RFs might have a role in defining inter-patient heterogeneity and in the prediction of therapy response. It is important to implement future studies with larger and more homogeneous patient populations to confirm the efficacy of these biomarkers.","Virginia Liberini,Virginia Liberini,Osvaldo Rampado,Osvaldo Rampado,E.

10.1111/rssc.12469,,,A Bayesian nonparametric model for textural pattern heterogeneity,"Cancer radiomics is an emerging discipline promising to elucidate lesion phenotypes and tumor heterogeneity through patterns of enhancement, texture, morphology, and shape. The prevailing technique for image texture analysis relies on the construction and synthesis of Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM). Practice currently reduces the structured count data of a GLCM to reductive and redundant summary statistics for which analysis requires variable selection and multiple comparisons for each application, thus limiting reproducibility. In this article, we develop a Bayesian multivariate probabilistic framework for the analysis and unsupervised clustering of a sample of GLCM objects. By appropriately accounting for skewness and zero-inflation of the observed counts and simultaneously adjusting for existing spatial autocorrelation at nearby cells, the methodology facilitates estimation of texture pattern distributions within the GLCM lattice itself. The techniques are applied to cluster images of adrenal lesions obtained from CT scans with and without administration of contrast. We further assess whether the resultant subtypes are clinically oriented by investigating their correspondence with pathological diagnoses. Additionally, we compare performance to a class of machine-learning approaches currently used in cancer radiomics with simulation studies.","Xiao Li,Michele Guindani,Xiao Li,Chaan S.

METHODS A total of 263 pathologically confirmed LNs from 124 patients with NCSLC were retrospectively analyzed. Positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) examination was performed before treatment according to the clinical schedule. In the training cohort (N=185), malignancy-related features, such as SUVmax, short-axis diameter (SAD), and CT radiomics features, were extracted from the regions of LN based on the PET/CT scan. The Minimum-Redundancy Maximum-Relevance (mRMR) algorithm and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model were used for feature selection and radiomics score building. The radiomics score (Rad-Score) and SUVmax were incorporated in a PET/CT nomogram using the multivariable logistic regression analysis. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated with discrimination, calibration, and clinical application in an independent testing cohort (N=78). RESULTS The radiomics scores consisting of 14 selected features were significantly associated with LN status for both training cohort with AUC of 0.849 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.796-0.903) and testing cohort with AUC of 0.828 (95% CI, 0.782-0.919). The PET/CT nomogram incorporating radiomics score and SUVmax showed moderate improvement of the efficiency with AUC of 0.881 (95% CI, 0.834-0.928) in the training cohort and AUC of 0.872 (95% CI, 0.797-0.946) in the testing cohort. The decision curve analysis indicated that the PET/CT nomogram was clinically useful. CONCLUSION The PET/CT nomogram, which incorporates Rad-Score and SUVmax, can improve the diagnostic performance of LN metastasis. KEY POINTS • The PET/CT nomogram (Int-Score) based on lymph node (LN) PET/CT images can reliably predict LN status in NSCLC. • Int-Score is a relatively objective diagnostic method, which can play an auxiliary role in the process of clinicians making treatment decisions.","Yunming Xie,Hongguang Zhao,Yunming Xie,Yan Guo,Hongguang Zhao,Yan Guo,Fanyang Meng,Yan Guo,Fanyang Meng,Xiangchun Liu,Xiangchun Liu,Yiying Zhang,Yiying Zhang,Xiaochen Huai,Qianting Wong,Xiaochen Huai,Yu Fu,Qianting Wong,Huimao Zhang,Yu Fu,Hua Zhang,Huimao Zhang",European Radiology,2021.0
10.1007/s12539-020-00410-7,33411162.0,,A Radiomics Signature to Quantitatively Analyze COVID-19-Infected Pulmonary Lesions.,"Assessing pulmonary lesions using computed tomography (CT) images is of great significance to the severity diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-infected patients. Such assessment mainly depends on radiologists' subjective judgment, which is inefficient and presents difficulty for those with low levels of experience, especially in rural areas. This work focuses on developing a radiomics signature to quantitatively analyze whether COVID-19-infected pulmonary lesions are mild (Grade I) or moderate/severe (Grade II). We retrospectively analyzed 1160 COVID-19-infected pulmonary lesions from 16 hospitals. First, texture features were extracted from the pulmonary lesion regions of CT images. Then, feature preselection was performed and a radiomics signature was built using a stepwise logistic regression. The stepwise logistic regression also calculated the correlation between the radiomics signature and the grade of a pulmonary lesion. Finally, a logistic regression model was trained to classify the grades of pulmonary lesions. Given a significance level of α = 0.001, the stepwise logistic regression achieved an R (multiple correlation coefficient) of 0.70, which is much larger than Rα = 0.18 (the critical value of R). In the classification, the logistic regression model achieved an AUC of 0.87 on an independent test set. Overall, the radiomics signature is significantly correlated with the grade of a pulmonary lesion in COVID-19 infection. The classification model is interpretable and can assist radiologists in quickly and efficiently diagnosing pulmonary lesions. This work aims to develop a CT-based radiomics signature to quantitatively analyze whether COVID-19-infected pulmonary lesions are mild (Grade I) or moderate/severe (Grade II). The logistic regression model established based on this radiomics signature can assist radiologists to quickly and efficiently diagnose the grades of pulmonary lesions.

10.3390/diagnostics11020380,,,A Systematic Review of PET Textural Analysis and Radiomics in Cancer,"Background: Although many works have supported the utility of PET radiomics, several authors have raised concerns over the robustness and replicability of the results. This study aimed to perform a systematic review on the topic of PET radiomics and the used methodologies. Methods: PubMed was searched up to 15 October 2020. Original research articles based on human data specifying at least one tumor type and PET image were included, excluding those that apply only first-order statistics and those including fewer than 20 patients. Each publication, cancer type, objective and several methodological parameters (number of patients and features, validation approach, among other things) were extracted. Results: A total of 290 studies were included. Lung (28%) and head and neck (24%) were the most studied cancers. The most common objective was prognosis/treatment response (46%), followed by diagnosis/staging (21%), tumor characterization (18%) and technical evaluations (15%). The average number of patients included was 114 (median = 71; range 20–1419), and the average number of high-order features calculated per study was 31 (median = 26, range 1–286). Conclusions: PET radiomics is a promising field, but the number of patients in most publications is insufficient, and very few papers perform in-depth validations.

METHODS A total of 100 consecutive IDC patients who underwent surgical resection of primary tumor with sentinel lymph-node biopsy and/or ALN dissection without any neoadjuvant treatment were analyzed. Volume of interests (VOIs) were drawn more than 2.5 of standardized uptake value in the primary tumor on the PET scan using 3D slicer. Pyradiomics package was used for the extraction of texture features in python. The radiomics prediction model for ALN metastasis was developed in 75 patients of the training cohort and validated in 25 patients of the test cohort. XGBoost algorithm was utilized to select features and build radiomics model. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the predictive model were calculated. RESULTS ALN metastasis was found in 43 patients (43%). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of F-18 FDG PET/CT for the diagnosis of ALN metastasis in the entire patients were 55.8%, 93%, and 77%, respectively. The radiomics model for the prediction of ALN metastasis was successfully developed. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the radiomics model for the prediction of ALN metastasis in the test cohorts were 90.9%, 71.4%, and 80%, respectively. CONCLUSION The machine learning-based radiomics model showed good sensitivity for the prediction of ALN metastasis and could assist the preoperative individualized prediction of ALN status in patients with IDC.","Byung Seop Song,Bong-Il Song",Breast Cancer,2021.0

Internal and external validations were performed using a bootstrapping method. With the final 410 patients (58.2±13.0years-old; 268 female), the radiomic model consisted of seven selected features. In both of the internal and the external validation, the integrated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of both the radiomic model (0.714, P<0.001 [internal validation]; 0.652, P=0.010 [external validation]) and the merged model (0.719, P<0.001; 0.651, P=0.014) were significantly higher than those of the clinical model (0.616; 0.594). The radiomics-based model on preoperative CT images may improve RFS prediction and high-risk stratification in the preoperative setting of LAGC.","Jaeseung Shin,Jaeseung Shin,Joon Seok Lim,Joon Seok Lim,Yong Min Huh,Joon Seok Lim,Joo Hang Kim,Yong Min Huh,Woo Jin Hyung,Jie-Hyun Kim,Jae Joon Chung,Woo Jin Hyung,Jae-Joon Chung,Kyunghwa Han,Kwang Hyub Han,Sung-Won Kim,Kyunghwa Han,Do Young Kim,Sung-Won Kim,Sung won Kim",Scientific Reports,2021.0
10.1007/s00330-020-07581-3,33409797.0,,An MRI-based radiomics signature as a pretreatment noninvasive predictor of overall survival and chemotherapeutic benefits in lower-grade gliomas.,"OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to develop and validate a radiomics signature for predicting survival and chemotherapeutic benefits of patients with lower-grade gliomas (LGG). METHODS Radiomics features were extracted from precontrast axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and contrast-enhanced axial T-1 weighted (CE-T1-w) sequence. Lasso Cox regression model was used for feature selection and radiomics signature building. The radiomics signature was developed in a primary cohort that consisted of 149 LGG patients and was then validated on an entirely new validation cohort that contained 66 LGG patients. A radiomics nomogram for the prediction of OS was established by adding the radiomics to clinicopathologic nomogram which developed with clinical data. RESULTS A radiomics signature derived from joint CE-T1-w and FLAIR images showed better prognostic performance (C-index, 0.798) than signatures derived from CE-T1-w (C-index, 0.744) or FLAIR (C-index, 0.736) sequences alone. Multivariable Cox regression revealed that the radiomics signature was an independent prognostic factor. One radiomics nomogram integrated the radiomics signature from joint CE-T1-w and FLAIR sequences with the clinicopathologic nomogram outperformed the clinicopathologic nomogram based on clinicopathologic data alone in predicting OS of LGG (C-index, 0.821 vs. 0.692; p < 0.001). Further analysis revealed that patients with higher radiomics signature were prone to benefit from chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS The radiomics signature was independent with clinicopathologic data and was a noninvasive pretreatment predictor for LGG patients' survival. Moreover, it could predict which patients with LGG benefit from chemotherapy. KEY POINTS • A radiomics signature derived from joint CE-T1-w and FLAIR sequences showed better prognostic performance than signatures derived from either single imaging modality. • The radiomics signature is an independent prognostic factor and outperformed clinicopathologic features in predicting overall survival of LGG patients. • The radiomics signature could help preoperatively identify LGG patients who may benefit from chemotherapy.","Jingtao Wang,Jingtao Wang,Jingtao Wang,Xin Zheng,Jingtao Wang,Xuejun Zheng,Jinling Zhang,Jinling Zhang,Jinling Zhang,Hao Xue,Lijie Wang,Xue Hao,Hao Xue,Lijie Wang,Rui Jiang,Rui Jing,Shuo Chen,Shuo Chen,Fengyuan Che,Fengyuan Che,Xueyuan Heng,Fengyuan Che,Xueyuan Heng,Gang Li,Li Gang,Gang Li,Fuzhong Xue,Gang Li,Gang Li,Fuzhong Xue",European Radiology,2021.0
10.3390/diagnostics11010085,33430275.0,,Associations between Statin/Omega3 Usage and MRI-Based Radiomics Signatures in Prostate Cancer,"Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American men. Statins and omega-3 are two medications recently found to correlate with prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness, but the observed associations are complex and controversial. We therefore explore the novel application of radiomics in studying statin and omega-3 usage in prostate cancer patients. On MRIs of 91 prostate cancer patients, two regions of interest (ROIs), the whole prostate and the peripheral region of the prostate, were manually segmented. From each ROI, 944 radiomic features were extracted after field bias correction and normalization. Heatmaps were generated to study the radiomic feature patterns against statin or omega-3 usage. Radiomics models were trained on selected features and evaluated with 500-round threefold cross-validation for each drug/ROI combination. On the 1500 validation datasets, the radiomics model achieved average AUCs of 0.70, 0.74, 0.78, and 0.72 for omega-3/prostate, omega-3/peripheral, statin/prostate, and statin/peripheral, respectively. As the first study to analyze radiomics in relation to statin and omega-3 uses in prostate cancer patients, our study preliminarily established the existence of imaging-identifiable tissue-level changes in the prostate and illustrated the potential usefulness of radiomics for further exploring these medications’ effects and mechanisms in prostate cancer.","Yu Shi,Ethan Wahle,Yu Shi,Qian Du,Ethan Wahle,Qian Du,Qian Du,Qian Du,Qian Du,Luke Krajewski,Xiaoying Liang,Luke Krajewski,Sumin Zhou,Xiaoying Liang,Sumin Zhou,Chi Zhang,Chi Zhang,Chi Zhang,Michael J.

This study aimed to investigate the value of chest CT radiomics for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia compared with clinical model and COVID-19 reporting and data system (CO-RADS), and develop an open-source diagnostic tool with the constructed radiomics model.  Methods  This study enrolled 115 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and 435 non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients (training dataset, n = 379; validation dataset, n = 131; testing dataset, n = 40). Key radiomics features extracted from chest CT images were selected to build a radiomics signature using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Clinical and clinico-radiomics combined models were constructed. The combined model was further validated in the viral pneumonia cohort, and compared with performance of two radiologists using CO-RADS. The diagnostic performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) analysis, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results  Eight radiomics features and 5 clinical variables were selected to construct the combined radiomics model, which outperformed the clinical model in diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia with an area under the ROC (AUC) of 0.98 and good calibration in the validation cohort. The combined model also performed better in distinguishing COVID-19 from other viral pneumonia with an AUC of 0.93 compared with 0.75 (P = 0.03) for clinical model, and 0.69 (P = 0.008) or 0.82 (P = 0.15) for two trained radiologists using CO-RADS. The sensitivity and specificity of the combined model can be achieved to 0.85 and 0.90. The DCA confirmed the clinical utility of the combined model. An easy-to-use open-source diagnostic tool was developed using the combined model.  Conclusions  The combined radiomics model outperformed clinical model and CO-RADS for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia, which can facilitate more rapid and accurate detection.","Huanhuan Liu,Huanhuan Liu,Hua Ren,Zengbin Wu,Hua Ren,He Xu,Zengbin Wu,He Xu,Shuhai Zhang,Shuhai Zhang,Jinning Li,Jinning Li,Lingmi Hou,Liang Hou,Runmin Chi,Runmin Chi,Hui Zheng,Hui Zheng,Yanhong Chen,Yanhong Chen,Shaofeng Duan,Huimin Li,Shaofeng Duan,Shaofeng Duan,Huimin Li,Zongyu Xie,Zongyu Xie,Zongyu Xie,Zongyu Xie,Zongyu Xie,Dengbin Wang,Dengbin Wang,Dengbin Wang",Journal of Translational Medicine,2021.0

Radiomics features derived from medical images show great potential for prediction and prognosis. The aim is to develop and validate a machine learning radiomics model to predict local tumor progression based on the pre-ablation CT scan of colorectal liver metastases patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ninety patients with colorectal liver metastases (140 lesions) treated by ablation were included in the study and were randomly divided into a training (n=63 patients/n=94 lesions) and validation (n=27 patients/n=46 lesions) cohort. After manual lesion volume segmentation and preprocessing, 1593 radiomics features were extracted for each lesion. Three machine learning survival models were constructed based on (1) radiomics features, (2) clinical features and (3) a combination of clinical and radiomics features to predict local tumor progression free survival. Feature reduction and machine learning modeling were performed and optimized with sequential model-based optimization. RESULTS Median follow-up was 24months (range 6-115). Thirty-one (22%) lesions developed local tumor progression. The concordance index in the validation set to predict local tumor progression free survival was 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77-0.79) for the radiomics model, 0.56 (95%CI: 0.55-0.57) for the clinical model and 0.79 (95%CI: 0.78-0.80) for the combined model. CONCLUSION A machine learning-based radiomics analysis of routine clinical CT imaging pre-ablation could act as a valuable biomarker model to predict local tumor progression with curative intent for colorectal liver metastases patients.","Marjaneh Taghavi,Marjaneh Taghavi,Femke C.R.

We aimed to assess the classification performance of computed tomography (CT)-based CT signs and radiomics features for discriminating COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia. METHODS: A total of 154 patients with confirmed viral pneumonia (COVID-19: 89 cases, influenza pneumonia: 65 cases) were collected retrospectively in this study. Pneumonia signs and radiomics features were extracted from the initial unenhanced chest CT images to build independent and combined models. The predictive performance of the radiomics model, CT sign model, the combined model was constructed based on the whole dataset and internally invalidated by using 1000-times bootstrap. Diagnostic performance of the models was assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The combined models consisted of 4 significant CT signs and 7 selected features and demonstrated better discrimination performance between COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia than the single radiomics model. For the radiomics model, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.888 (sensitivity, 86.5%; specificity, 78.4%; accuracy, 83.1%), and the AUC was 0.906 (sensitivity, 86.5%; specificity, 81.5%; accuracy, 84.4%) in the CT signs model. After combining CT signs and radiomics features, AUC of the combined model was 0.959 (sensitivity, 89.9%; specificity, 90.7%; accuracy, 90.3%).

10.3389/fonc.2020.634298,,,Comparison of Radiomic Models Based on Low-Dose and Standard-Dose CT for Prediction of Adenocarcinomas and Benign Lesions in Solid Pulmonary Nodules.,"Objectives: This study aimed to develop radiomic models based on low-dose CT (LDCT) and standard-dose CT to distinguish adenocarcinomas from benign lesions in patients with solid solitary pulmonary nodules and compare the performance among these radiomic models and Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS). The reproducibility of radiomic features between LDCT and standard-dose CT were also evaluated. Methods: A total of 141 consecutive pathologically confirmed solid solitary pulmonary nodules were enrolled including 50 adenocarcinomas and 48 benign nodules in primary cohort and 22 adenocarcinomas and 21 benign nodules in validation cohort. LDCT and standard-dose CT scans were conducted using same acquisition parameters and reconstruction method except for radiation dose. All nodules were automatically segmented and 104 original radiomic features were extracted. The concordance correlation coefcient was used to quantify reproducibility of radiomic features between LDCT and standard-dose CT. Radiomic features were selected to build radiomic signature, and clinical characteristics and radiomic signature were combined to develop radiomic nomogram for LDCT and standard-dose CT, respectively. The performance of radiomic models and Lung-RADS was assessed by area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Results: Shape and first order features, and neighbouring gray tone difference matrix features were highly reproducible between LDCT and standard-dose CT. No significant differences of AUCs were found among radiomic signature and nomogram of LDCT and standard-dose CT in both primary and validation cohort (0.915 vs. 0.919 vs. 0.898 vs. 0.909 and 0.976 vs. 0.976 vs. 0.985 vs. 0.987, respectively). These radiomic models had higher specificity than Lung-RADS (all correct P < 0.05), while there were no significant differences of sensitivity between Lung-RADS and radiomic models. Conclusions: The diagnostic performance of LDCT-based radiomic models to differentiate adenocarcinomas from benign lesions in solid pulmonary nodules were equivalent to that of standard-dose CT. The LDCT-based radiomic model with higher specificity and lower false-positive rate than Lung-RADS might help reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment of solid pulmonary nodules in lung cancer screening.","Jieke Liu,Hao Xu,Jieke Liu,Haomiao Qing,Hao Xu,Haomiao Qing,Yong Li,Yong Li,Xi Yang,Chao He,Xi Yang,Jing Ren,Changjiu He,Peng Zhou,Jing Ren,Jing Ren,Peng Zhou",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0

A secondary objective was to evaluate the findings of papers that based their analyses on inter-site heterogeneity. This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA statement. After the initial retrieval of 145 articles, the final systematic review comprised six articles. Association between radiomic features and OS was evaluated in 3/6 studies (50%); all articles showed a significant association between radiomic features and OS. Association with PFS was evaluated in 5/6 (83%) articles; the period of follow-up ranged between six and 36 months. All the articles showed significant association between radiomic models and PFS. Inter-site textural features were used for analysis in 2/6 (33%) articles. They demonstrated that high levels of inter-site textural heterogeneity were significantly associated with incomplete surgical resection in breast cancer gene-negative patients, and that lower heterogeneity was associated with complete resectability. There were some differences among papers in methodology; for example, only 3/6 (50%) articles included validation cohorts. In conclusion, radiomic models have demonstrated promising results as predictors of survival in OC patients, although larger studies are needed to allow clinical applicability.","Stefania Rizzo,Lucia Manganaro,Stefania Rizzo,Stefania Rizzo,Miriam Dolciami,Lucia Manganaro,Maria Luisa Gasparri,Miriam Dolciami,Andrea Papadia,Maria Luisa Gasparri,Maria Luisa Gasparri,Filippo Del Grande,Andrea Papadia,Filippo Del Grande",Cancers,2021.0
10.3389/fonc.2020.570396,,,Computed Tomography Radiomics for Predicting Pathological Grade of Renal Cell Carcinoma.,"Background: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common renal cancer and it has the worst prognosis among all renal cancers. However, traditional radiological characteristics on computed tomography (CT) scans of ccRCC have been insufficient to predict the pathological grade of ccRCC before surgery. Methods: Patients with ccRCC were retrospectively enrolled into this study and were separated into two groups according to the World Health Organization (WHO)/ International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grading system, i.e., low-grade (Grade I and II) group and high-grade (Grade III and IV) group. Traditional CT radiological characteristics such as tumor size, pre- and post-enhancing CT densities were assessed. In addition, radiomic texture analysis based on the CT imaging of the ccRCC were also performed. A CT-based machine learning method combining the traditional radiological characteristics and radiomic features was used in the predictive modeling for differentiating the low-grade from the high-grade ccRCC. Model performance was evaluated with the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Results: A total of 264 patients with pathologically confirmed ccRCC were included in this study. In this cohort, 206 patients had the low-grade tumors and 58 had the high-grade tumors. The model built with traditional radiological characteristics achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9175 (95% CI: 0.8765-0.9585) and 0.8088 (95% CI: 0.7064- 0.9113) in differentiating the low-grade from the high-grade ccRCC for the training cohort and the validation cohort respectively. The model built with the radiomic textural features yielded an AUC value of 0.8170 (95% CI: 0.7353-0.8987) and 0.8017 (95% CI: 0.6878-0.9157) for the training cohort and the validation cohort, respectively. The combined model integrating both the traditional radiological characteristics and the radiomic textural features achieved the highest efficacy, with an AUC of 0.9235 (95% CI: 0.8646–0.9824) and an AUC of 0.9099 (95% CI: 0.8324–0.9873) for the training cohort and validation cohort, respectively. Conclusion: We developed a machine learning radiomic model achieving a satisfying performance in differentiating the low-grade from the high-grade ccRCC.

10.3390/cancers13040757,,,Dedicated Axillary MRI-Based Radiomics Analysis for the Prediction of Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer,"Radiomics features may contribute to increased diagnostic performance of MRI in the prediction of axillary lymph node metastasis. The objective of the study was to predict preoperative axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer using clinical models and radiomics models based on T2-weighted (T2W) dedicated axillary MRI features with node-by-node analysis. From August 2012 until October 2014, all women who had undergone dedicated axillary 3.0T T2W MRI, followed by axillary surgery, were retrospectively identified, and available clinical data were collected. All axillary lymph nodes were manually delineated on the T2W MR images, and quantitative radiomics features were extracted from the delineated regions. Data were partitioned patient-wise to train 100 models using different splits for the training and validation cohorts to account for multiple lymph nodes per patient and class imbalance. Features were selected in the training cohorts using recursive feature elimination with repeated 5-fold cross-validation, followed by the development of random forest models. The performance of the models was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC). A total of 75 women (median age, 61 years; interquartile range, 51–68 years) with 511 axillary lymph nodes were included. On final pathology, 36 (7%) of the lymph nodes had metastasis. A total of 105 original radiomics features were extracted from the T2W MR images. Each cohort split resulted in a different number of lymph nodes in the training cohorts and a different set of selected features. Performance of the 100 clinical and radiomics models showed a wide range of AUC values between 0.41–0.74 and 0.48–0.89 in the training cohorts, respectively, and between 0.30–0.98 and 0.37–0.99 in the validation cohorts, respectively. With these results, it was not possible to obtain a final prediction model. Clinical characteristics and dedicated axillary MRI-based radiomics with node-by-node analysis did not contribute to the prediction of axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer based on data where variations in acquisition and reconstruction parameters were not addressed.","Sanaz Samiei,Sanaz Samiei,R.

Radiomics nomogram is a widely used noninvasive tool that could predict tumor phenotypes. In this study, we performed radiomics analysis to develop and validate a CT-based nomogram for the preoperative prediction of nuclear grades in ccRCC. METHOD CT images and clinical data of 258 ccRCC patients were retrieved from the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Radiomics features were extracted from arterial-phase CT images using 3D Slicer software. LASSO regression model was performed to develop a radiomics signature in the training set (n=143). A radiomics nomogram was constructed combining radiomics signature and selected clinical predictors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration curve were used to determine the performance of the radiomics nomogram in the training and validation set (n=115). Decision curve analysis was used to assess the clinical usefulness of the CT-based nomogram. RESULTS One thousand three hundred sixteen radiomics features were extracted from arterial-phase CT images. A radiomics signature, consisting of 20 features, was developed and showed a favorable performance in discriminating nuclear grades with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.914 and 0.846 in the training and validation set, respectively. The CT-based nomogram, including the radiomics signature and theCT-determined T stage, achieved good calibration and discrimination in the training set (AUC, 0.929; 95% CI, 0.886-0.972) and validation set (AUC, 0.876; 95% CI, 0.812-0.939). Decision curve analysis demonstrated the clinical usefulness of the CT-based nomogram. CONCLUSION The noninvasive CT-based nomogram, including radiomics signature and CT-determined T stage, could improve the accuracy of preoperative grading of ccRCC and provide individualized treatment for ccRCC patients. KEY POINTS • Contrast-enhanced CT may help in preoperative grading of ccRCC. • The CT-based nomogram incorporated a radiomics signature and CT-determined T stage could preoperatively predict ccRCC grades. • The CT-based nomogram has the potential to improve individualized treatment and assist clinical decision making of ccRCC patients.","Zijie Zheng,Zaosong Zheng,Zhiliang Chen,Zhiliang Chen,Yingwei Xie,Qiyu Zhong,Yingwei Xie,Wenqian Xie,Qiyu Zhong,Wenlian Xie",European Radiology,2021.0
10.21037/atm-20-7673,,,Development and validation of magnetic resonance imaging-based radiomics models for preoperative prediction of microsatellite instability in rectal cancer.,"Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a predictive biomarker for response to chemotherapy and a prognostic biomarker for clinical outcomes of rectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate radiomics models for preoperative prediction of the MSI status of rectal cancer based on magnetic resonance (MR) images.This study retrospectively recruited 491 rectal cancer patients with pathologically confirmed MSI status. Patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n=327) and a validation cohort (n=164). The most predictive radiomics features were selected using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis, the two-sample t test, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. XGBoost models were constructed in the training cohort to discriminate the MSI status using clinical factors, radiomics features, or a combined model incorporating both the radiomics signature and independent clinical characteristics. The diagnostic performance of these three models was evaluated in the validation cohort based on their area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.Among the 491 rectal cancer patients, the prevalence of MSI was 10.39% (51/491). Following ICC analysis, two-sample t test, and LASSO regression, six radiomics features were selected for subsequent analysis. The combined model, which incorporated both the clinical factors and radiomics features achieved an AUC of 0.895 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.838-0.938] in the validation cohort, and showed better performance in predicting MSI status than the other two models using either clinical factors (P=0.015) or radiomics features (P=0.204) alone.Radiomics features based on preoperative T2-weighted MR imaging (MRI) are associated with the MSI status of rectal cancer.

METHODS A total of 80 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) who underwent surgical resection after nCRT were enrolled retrospectively. Rectal MR images were scanned pre- and post-nCRT. The radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted images, then reduced separately by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and principal component analysis (PCA). Four classifiers of Logistic Regression, Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) models were constructed to assess the tumor regression grade (TRG) and pathologic complete response (pCR), respectively. The diagnostic performances of models were determined with leave-one-out cross-validation by generating receiver operating characteristic curves and decision curve analysis. RESULTS Three features related to the TRG and 11 features related to the pCR were obtained by LASSO. Top five principal components representing a cumulative contribution of 80% to overall features were selected by PCA. For TRG, the area under the curve (AUC) of RF model was 0.943 for LASSO and 0.930 for PCA, higher than other models (P<0.05 for both). As for pCR, the AUCs of KNN for LASSO and PCA were 0.945 and 0.712, higher than other models (P<0.05 for both). The DCA showed that LASSO algorithm was clinically superior to PCA. CONCLUSION MRI-based radiomics models demonstrated good performance for evaluating the treatment response of LARC after nCRT and LASSO algorithm yielded more clinical benefit.","Zhihui Li,Zhihui Li,Zhihui Li,Xiaolu Ma,Xiaolu Ma,Shoukuan Fu,Haidi Lu,Fu Shen,Yuwei Xia,Haidi Lu,Jianping Lu,Yuwei Xia,Jianping Lu",BMC Medical Imaging,2021.0
10.1007/s00371-021-02077-7,,,Glioma classification via MR images radiomics analysis,"Accurate glioma classification before surgery is of the utmost important in clinical decision making and prognosis prediction. In this paper, we investigate the impact of multi-modal MR image fusion for the differentiation of low-grade gliomas (LGG) versus high-grade gliomas (HGG) via integrative analyses of radiomic features and machine learning approaches. A set of 80 histologically confirmed gliomas patients (40 HGG and 40 LGG) obtained from the MICCAI BraTS 2019 data were involved in this study. To achieve this work, we propose to combine T1 with T2 or FLAIR modality in the non-subsampled shearlet domain. Firstly, the pre-processed source MR images are decomposed into low-frequency (LF) and several high-frequency (HF) sub-images. LF sub-images are fused using the proposed weight local features fusion rule while HF sub-images are combined based on the novel sum-modified-laplacian technique. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fusion approach outperformed the recent state-of-the-art approaches in terms of entropy and feature mutual information. Subsequently, a key radiomics signature was retrieved by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression algorithm. Five machine learning classifiers were established and evaluated with the retrieved dataset, then with the fused dataset using tenfold cross-validation scheme. As a result, the random forest had the highest accuracy of 96.5% with 21 features selected from the raw data and 96.1% with 16 features selected from the fused data.

10.3390/tomography7010005,,,Identifying Robust Radiomics Features for Lung Cancer by Using In-Vivo and Phantom Lung Lesions,"We propose a novel framework for determining radiomics feature robustness by considering the effects of both biological and noise signals. This framework is preliminarily tested in a study predicting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Pairs of CT images (baseline, 3-week post therapy) of 46 NSCLC patients with known EGFR mutation status were collected and a FDA-customized anthropomorphic thoracic phantom was scanned on two vendors’ scanners at four different tube currents. Delta radiomics features were extracted from the NSCLC patient CTs and reproducible, non-redundant, and informative features were identified. The feature value differences between EGFR mutant and EGFR wildtype patients were quantitatively measured as the biological signal. Similarly, radiomics features were extracted from the phantom CTs. A pairwise comparison between settings resulted in a feature value difference that was quantitatively measured as the noise signal. Biological signals were compared to noise signals at each setting to determine if the distributions were significantly different by two-sample t-test, and thus robust. Four optimal features were selected to predict EGFR mutation status, Tumor-Mass, Sigmoid-Offset-Mean, Gabor-Energy and DWT-Energy, which quantified tumor mass, tumor-parenchyma density transition at boundary, line-like pattern inside tumor and intratumoral heterogeneity, respectively. The first three variables showed robustness across the majority of studied CT acquisition parameters. The textual feature DWT-Energy was less robust. The proposed framework was able to determine robustness of radiomics features at specific settings by comparing biological signal to noise signal. Identification of robust radiomics features may improve the generalizability of radiomics models in future studies.","Liwu Lin,Lin Lu,Lin Lu,Shen-Su Sun,Shawn H Sun,Aaron Afran,Aaron Afran,Hao Yang,Hao Yang,Zheng Feng Lu,Z Lu,J So,Zheng Feng Lu,James So,James So,Lawrence H.

This study contributes to the technical validation of radiomic features from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by evaluating the repeatability of features from four MR sequences: pre-contrast T1- and T2-weighted images, pre-contrast quantitative T1 maps (qT1), and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. Fifty-one patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases were scanned twice, up to 7 days apart. Repeatability was quantified using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and repeatability coefficient (RC), and the impact of non-Gaussian feature distributions and image normalisation was evaluated. Most radiomic features had non-Gaussian distributions, but Box–Cox transformations enabled ICCs and RCs to be calculated appropriately for an average of 97% of features across sequences. ICCs ranged from 0.30 to 0.99, with volume and other shape features tending to be most repeatable; volume ICC > 0.98 for all sequences. 19% of features from non-normalised images exhibited significantly different ICCs in pair-wise sequence comparisons. Normalisation tended to increase ICCs for pre-contrast T1- and T2-weighted images, and decrease ICCs for qT1 maps. RCs tended to vary more between sequences than ICCs, showing that evaluations of feature performance depend on the chosen metric. This work suggests that feature-specific repeatability, from specific combinations of MR sequence and pre-processing steps, should be evaluated to select robust radiomic features as biomarkers in specific studies. In addition, as different repeatability metrics can provide different insights into a specific feature, consideration of the appropriate metric should be taken in a study-specific context.","Damien J.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of magnetic field strength on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics features in neuroradiology clinical practice. Methods: T1 3D SPGR sequence was acquired on two phantoms and 10 healthy volunteers with two clinical MR devices from the same manufacturer using two different magnetic fields (1.5 and 3T). Phantoms varied in terms of gadolinium concentrations and textural heterogeneity. 27 regions of interest were segmented (phantom: 21, volunteers: 6) using the LIFEX software. 34 features were analyzed. Results: In the phantom dataset, 10 (67%) out of 15 radiomics features were significantly different when measured at 1.5T or 3T (student’s t-test, p < 0.05). Gray levels resampling, and pixel size also influence part of texture features. These findings were validated in healthy volunteers. Conclusions: According to daily used protocols for clinical examinations, radiomic features extracted on 1.5T should not be used interchangeably with 3T when evaluating texture features. Such confounding factor should be adjusted when adapting the results of a study to a different platform, or when designing a multicentric trial.","Samy Ammari,Samy Ammari,Stéphanie Pitre-Champagnat,Stéphanie Pitre-Champagnat,Laurent Dercle,Émilie Chouzenoux,Laurent Dercle,Salma Moalla,Emilie Chouzenoux,Salma Moalla,Sylvain Reuzé,Salma Moalla,Sylvain Reuzé,Hugues Talbot,Hugues Talbot,T.

From 83 patients with lung cancer who underwent SRS for brain metastasis, a total of 118 metastatic lesions were included. Two neuroradiologists independently performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based texture analysis using the Imaging Biomarker Explorer software. Inter-reader reliability as well as univariable and multivariable analyses were performed for texture features and clinical parameters to determine independent predictors for local progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Furthermore, Harrell’s concordance index (C-index) was used to assess the performance of the independent texture features. The primary tumor histology of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) was the only clinical parameter significantly associated with local PFS in multivariable analysis. Run-length non-uniformity (RLN) and short-run emphasis were the independent texture features associated with local PFS. In the non-SCLC (NSCLC) subgroup analysis, RLN and local range mean were associated with local PFS. The C-index of independent texture features was 0.79 for the all-patients group and 0.73 for the NSCLC subgroup. In conclusion, texture analysis on pre-treatment MRI of lung cancer patients with brain metastases may have a role in predicting SRS response.","Jung Hyun Park,Jung Hyun Park,Byung Se Choi,Jung Hyun Park,Byung Se Choi,Jung Ho Han,Chae Yong Kim,Jung Ho Han,Chae-Yong Kim,Jungheum Cho,Jungheum Cho,Yun Jung Bae,Yun Jung Bae,Leonard Sunwoo,Jae Hyoung Kim,Leonard Sunwoo,Jae Hyoung Kim",Journal of Clinical Medicine,2021.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS Separate water and tissue phantoms were imaged twice with the same protocol in a test-retest experiment using a 1.5-T scanner. Protocols were acquired to favour signal-to-noise ratio and resolution. Forty-six features including first order statistics and second-order texture features were extracted, and repeatability was assessed by calculating the concordance correlation coefficient. Separately, base image noise and resolution were manipulated in an in silico experiment, and robustness of features was calculated by assessing percentage coefficient of variation and linear correlation of features with noise and resolution. These simulation data were compared with the acquired data. Features were classified by their degree (high, intermediate, or low) of robustness and repeatability. RESULTS Eighty percent of the MRI features were repeatable (concordance correlation coefficient > 0.9) in the phantom test-retest experiment. The majority (approximately 90%) demonstrated a strong or intermediate correlation with image acquisition parameter, and 19/46 (41%) and 13/46 (28%) of features were highly robust to noise and resolution, respectively (coefficient of variation < 5%). Agreement between the acquired and simulation data varied, with the range of agreement within feature classes between 11 and 92%. CONCLUSION Most MRI features were repeatable in a phantom test-retest study. This phantom data may serve as a lower limit of feature MRI repeatability. Robustness of features varies with acquisition parameter, and appropriate features can be selected for clinical validation studies.","Joshua Shur,Matthew Blackledge,Joshua Shur,James A. d’Arcy,Matthew D.

The cluster label was included together with other clinical data to train an ensemble model using five predictive models (Cox, random forest, RSF, logistic regression, and logistic-elastic net). Ensemble performance was evaluated over the independent test set for both recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). The Kaplan-Meier curves for OS stratified by cluster label show significant differences for both training and testing (p val < 0.0001). When compared to the models trained using clinical data only, the inclusion of the cluster label improves AUC test performance from .62 to .79 and from .66 to .80 for OS and RFS, respectively. The extraction of a single feature, namely a cluster label, to represent the high-dimensional radiomic feature space reduces the dimensionality and sparsity of the data. Moreover, inclusion of the cluster label improves model performance compared to clinical data only and offers comparable performance to the models including raw radiomic features.","Himanshu K.

10.1038/s41598-020-79829-3,33436737.0,,Precise enhancement quantification in post-operative MRI as an indicator of residual tumor impact is associated with survival in patients with glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor. Standard therapy consists of maximum safe resection combined with adjuvant radiochemotherapy followed by chemotherapy with temozolomide, however prognosis is extremely poor. Assessment of the residual tumor after surgery and patient stratification into prognostic groups (i.e., by tumor volume) is currently hindered by the subjective evaluation of residual enhancement in medical images (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). Furthermore, objective evidence defining the optimal time to acquire the images is lacking. We analyzed 144 patients with glioblastoma, objectively quantified the enhancing residual tumor through computational image analysis and assessed the correlation with survival. Pathological enhancement thickness on post-surgical MRI correlated with survival (hazard ratio: 1.98, p<0.001). The prognostic value of several imaging and clinical variables was analyzed individually and combined (radiomics AUC 0.71, p=0.07; combined AUC 0.72, p<0.001). Residual enhancement thickness and radiomics complemented clinical data for prognosis stratification in patients with glioblastoma. Significant results were only obtained for scans performed between 24 and 72h after surgery, raising the possibility of confounding non-tumor enhancement in very early post-surgery MRI. Regarding the extent of resection, and in agreement with recent studies, the association between the measured tumor remnant and survival supports maximal safe resection whenever possible.","Alonso García-Ruiz,Pablo Naval‐Baudin,Alonso Garcia-Ruiz,Marta Ligero,Pablo Naval-Baudin,Albert Pons-Escoda,Marta Ligero,Marta Ligero,Marta Ligero,Marta Ligero,Albert Pons Escoda,Albert Pons-Escoda,Jordi Bruna,Gerard Plans,Jordi Bruna,Nahum Calvo,Gerard Plans,Nahum Calvo,Mònica Cos,Carles Majós,Mònica Cos,Carles Majós,Raquel Pérez-López,C.

METHODS A total of 230 women with early-stage invasive breast cancer were retrospectively analyzed. A radiomics signature was constructed based on preoperative multiparametric MRI from the training dataset (n = 126) of center 1, then tested in the validation cohort (n = 42) from center 1 and an external test cohort (n = 62) from center 2. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to develop a radiomics nomogram incorporating radiomics signature and predictive clinical and radiological features. The radiomics nomogram's performance was evaluated by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical use and was compared with MRI-based descriptors of primary breast tumor. RESULTS The constructed radiomics nomogram incorporating radiomics signature and MRI-determined axillary lymph node (ALN) burden showed a good calibration and outperformed the MRI-determined ALN burden alone for predicting SLN burden (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.82 vs. 0.68 [p < 0.001] in training cohort; 0.81 vs. 0.68 in validation cohort [p = 0.04]; and 0.81 vs. 0.58 [p = 0.001] in test cohort). Compared with the MRI-based breast tumor combined descriptors, the radiomics nomogram achieved a higher AUC in test cohort (0.81 vs. 0.58, p = 0.005) and a comparable AUC in training (0.82 vs. 0.73, p = 0.15) and validation (0.81 vs. 0.65, p = 0.31) cohorts. CONCLUSION A multiparametric MRI-based radiomics nomogram can be used for preoperative prediction of the SLN burden in early-stage breast cancer. KEY POINTS • Radiomics nomogram incorporating radiomics signature and MRI-determined ALN burden outperforms the MRI-determined ALN burden alone for predicting SLN burden in early-stage breast cancer. • Radiomics nomogram might have a better predictive ability than the MRI-based breast tumor combined descriptors. • Multiparametric MRI-based radiomics nomogram can be used as a non-invasive tool for preoperative predicting of SLN burden in patients with early-stage breast cancer.","Xiang Zhang,Xiang Zhang,Zehong Yang,Xiang Zhang,Zehong Yang,Wenju Cui,Chushan Zheng,Wenju Cui,Chushan Zheng,Haojiang Li,Haojiang Li,Yudong Li,Liejing Lu,Yudong Li,Jiaji Mao,Liejing Lu,Weike Zeng,Jiaji Mao,Weike Zeng,Xiaodong Yang,Xiaodong Yang,Jian Zheng,Jun Shen,Jian Zheng,Jun Shen,Jun Shen",European Radiology,2021.0

METHODS A total of 149 patients (83 men, 66 women, mean age 61years old) with pathologically proven PDAC and a preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT scan between May 2009 and January 2016 were included in this retrospective study. The cohort of patients was divided into two separate groups for the training (99 patients) and validation (50 patients) in chronological order. Radiomics features were extracted from PET/CT images using Pyradiomics implemented in Python, and the XGBoost algorithm was used to build a prediction model. Conventional PET parameters, including standardized uptake value, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis, were also measured. The quality of the proposed model was appraised by means of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and areas under the ROC curve (AUC). RESULTS The prediction model based on a twelve-feature-combined radiomics signature could stratify PDAC patients into grade 1 and grade 2/3 groups with AUC of 0.994 in the training set and 0.921 in the validation set.

10.3390/cancers13040869,,,Quantitative FDG PET Assessment for Oncology Therapy.,"Positron emission tomography (PET) has unique characteristics for quantitative assessment of tumour biology in vivo. Accumulation of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) may reflect tumour characteristics based on its metabolic activity. Quantitative assessment of FDG uptake can often be applied for treatment monitoring after chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Numerous studies indicated biochemical change assessed by FDG PET as a more sensitive marker than morphological change estimated by CT or MRI. In addition, those with complete metabolic response after therapy may show better disease-free survival and overall survival than those with other responses. Assessment of metabolic change may be performed using absolute FDG uptake in the tumour (standardized uptake value: SUV). In addition, volumetric parameters such as metabolic tumour volume (MTV) have been introduced for quantitative assessment of FDG uptake in tumour. More recently, radiomics approaches that focus on image-based precision medicine have been applied to FDG PET, as well as other radiological imaging. Among these, texture analysis extracts intratumoral heterogeneity on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Combined with various machine learning techniques, these new quantitative parameters hold a promise for assessing tissue characterization and predicting treatment effect, and could also be used for future prognosis of various tumours, although multicentre clinical trials are needed before application in clinical settings.","Kenji Hirata,Nagara Tamaki,Kenji Hirata,Nagara Tamaki",Cancers,2021.0

We retrospectively analyzed data from consecutive women who underwent breast MRI including HTR-DCE MR sequencing for abnormal enhancing lesions and who had subsequent pathological analysis at our tertiary center. Semi-quantitative enhancement parameters and textural features were extracted. Temporal change across each phase of textural features in HTR-DCE MR sequences was calculated and called “kinetic textural parameters.” Statistical analysis by LASSO logistic regression and cross validation was performed to build a model. The diagnostic performance of the radiomic model was compared to the results of BI-RADS MR score analysis. We included 117 women with a mean age of 54years (28–88). Of the 174 lesions analyzed, 75 were benign and 99 malignant. Seven semi-quantitative enhancement parameters and 57 textural features were extracted. Regression analysis selected 15 significant variables in a radiomic model (called “malignant probability score”) which displayed an AUC=0.876 (sensitivity=0.98, specificity=0.52, accuracy=0.78). The performance of the malignant probability score to distinguish benign from malignant breast lesions (AUC=0.876, 95%CI 0.825–0.925) was significantly better than that of BI-RADS analysis (AUC=0.831, 95%CI 0.769–0.892).

METHODS We reviewed imaging and clinical data of 25 patients with a first episode of optic neuritis (ON) (14 females, 11 males; 5 bilateral ON; 7 left ON; 13 right ON). All patients underwent a complete ophthalmological assessment, including visual acuity and RNFL, neurological evaluation, orbits MRI. Segmentation of the optic nerves was performed through 3D slicer open software to get radiomics analysis. All patients underwent a complete neuro-ophthalmological follow-up at 6months to assess the VO, classified as: complete recovery, partial recovery, deficit persistence/relapse, or visual worsening and were diagnosed as MS or clinically isolated syndrome. RESULTS We observed significant correlations between radiomic features and RNFL and between radiomic features and VA.

10.1101/2021.01.29.21250803,,,Radiomics Analysis of Clinical Myocardial Perfusion Stress SPECT Images to Identify Coronary Artery Calcification,"Purpose: Myocardial perfusion stress SPECT (MPSS) is an established diagnostic test for patients suspected with coronary artery disease (CAD). Meanwhile, coronary artery calcification (CAC) scoring obtained from diagnostic CT is a highly specific test, offering incremental diagnostic information in identifying patients with significant CAD yet normal MPSS scans. However, after decades of wide utilization of MPSS, CAC is not commonly reimbursed (e.g. by the CMS), nor widely deployed in community settings. We aimed to perform radiomics analysis of normal MPSS scans to investigate the potential to predict the CAC score. Methods: We collected data from 428 patients with normal (non-ischemic) MPSS (99mTc-Sestamibi; consensus reading). A nuclear medicine physician verified iteratively reconstructed images (attenuation-corrected) to be free from fixed perfusion defects and artifactual attenuation. 3D images were automatically segmented into 4 regions of interest (ROIs), including myocardium and 3 vascular segments (LAD-LCX-RCA). We used our software package, standardized environment for radiomics analysis (SERA), to extract 487 radiomic features in compliance with the image biomarker standardization initiative (IBSI). Isotropic cubic voxels were discretized using fixed bin-number discretization (8 schemes). We first performed blind-to-outcome feature selection focusing on a priori usefulness, dynamic range, and redundancy of features. Subsequently, we performed univariate and multivariate machine learning analyses to predict CAC scores from i) selected radiomic features, ii) 10 clinical features, iii) combined radiomics + clinical features. Univariate analysis invoked Spearman correlation with Benjamini-Hotchberg false-discovery correction. The multivariate analysis incorporated stepwise linear regression, where we randomly selected a 15% test set and divided the other 85% of data into 70% training and 30% validation sets. Training started from a constant (intercept) model, iteratively adding/removing features (stepwise regression), invoking Akaike information criterion (AIC) to discourage overfitting. Validation was run similarly, except that the training output model was used as the initial model. We randomized training/validation sets 20 times, selecting the best model using log-likelihood for evaluation in the test set. Assessment in the test set was performed thoroughly by running the entire operation 50 times, subsequently employing Fisher9s method to verify the significance of independent tests. Results: Unsupervised feature selection significantly reduced 8x487 features to 56. In univariate analysis, no feature survived FDR to directly correlate with CAC scores. Applying Fisher9s method to the multivariate regression results demonstrated combining radiomics with the clinical features to enhance the significance of the prediction model across all cardiac segments. The median absolute Pearson9s coefficient values / p-values for the three feature-pools (radiomics, clinical, combined) were: (0.15, 0.38, 0.41)/(0.1, 0.001, 0.0006) for myocardium,  (0.24, 0.35, 0.41)/(0.05, 0.004, 0.0007) for LAD, (0.07, 0.24, 0.28)/(0.4, 0.06, 0.02), for LCX, and (0.06, 0.16, 0.24)/(0.4, 0.2, 0.05) for RCA, demonstrating consistently enhanced correlation and significance for combined radiomics and clinical features across all cardiac segments. Conclusions: Our standardized and statistically robust multivariate analysis demonstrated significant prediction of the CAC score for all cardiac segments when combining MPSS radiomic features with clinical features, suggesting radiomics analysis can add diagnostic or prognostic value to standard MPSS for wide clinical usage.","Saeed Ashrafinia,Pejman Dalaie,Saeed Ashrafinia,Pejman Dalaie,Sadaghiani Ms,Mohammad Salehi Sadaghiani,Thomas H.

CONCLUSION This machine learning model demonstrated to be feasible and useful to select Cho-PET features for T, N, and M with valuable association with high-risk PCa patients' outcomes. KEY POINTS • Artificial intelligence applications are feasible and useful to select Cho-PET features. • Our model demonstrated the presence of specific features for T, N, and M with valuable association with high-risk PCa patients' outcomes. • Further prospective studies are necessary to confirm our results and to develop the application of artificial intelligence in PET imaging of PCa.","Pierpaolo Alongi,Pierpaolo Alongi,Alessandro Stefano,Albert Comelli,Alessandro Stefano,Albert Comelli,Riccardo Laudicella,Riccardo Laudicella,Salvatore Scalisi,Salvatore Scalisi,Giuseppe Arnone,Giuseppe Arnone,Stefano Barone,Stefano Barone,Massimiliano Spada,M.

The study aimed to explore the role of multi-parametric radiomic, dosiomic and clinical features as prognostic factors for LC in SBC patients undergoing CIRT. Before CIRT, 57 patients underwent MR and CT imaging, from which tumour contours and dose maps were obtained. MRI and CT-based radiomic, and dosiomic features were selected and fed to two survival models, singularly or by combining them with clinical factors. Adverse LC was given by in-field recurrence or tumour progression. The dataset was split in development and test sets and the models' performance evaluated using the concordance index (C-index). Patients were then assigned a low- or high-risk score. Survival curves were estimated, and risk groups compared through log-rank tests (after Bonferroni correction α = 0.0083). The best performing models were built on features describing tumour shape and dosiomic heterogeneity (median/interquartile range validation C-index: 0.80/024 and 0.79/0.26), followed by combined (0.73/0.30 and 0.75/0.27) and CT-based models (0.77/0.24 and 0.64/0.28). Dosiomic and combined models could consistently stratify patients in two significantly different groups. Dosiomic and multi-parametric radiomic features showed to be promising prognostic factors for LC in SBC treated with CIRT.","Giulia Buizza,Chiara Paganelli,G. Buizza,Chiara Paganelli,E. D’Ippolito,E.

Data from 52 patients with brain metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma (28 with mutant EGFR, 24 with wild-type EGFR) were retrospectively reviewed. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1-CE), T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR), T2WI, and DWI sequences were selected for radiomics features extraction. A total of 438 radiomics features were extracted from each MR sequence. All sequences were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts. The least absolute shrinkage selection operator was used to select informative features, a radiomics signature was built with the logistic regression model of the training cohort, and the radiomics signature performance was evaluated using the validation cohort and an independent testing data set. The radiomics signature built on 9 selected features showed good discrimination in both the training and validation cohorts for T2-FLAIR. The radiomics signature of T2-FLAIR yielded an AUC of 0.987, a classification accuracy of 0.991, sensitivity of 1.000, and specificity of 0.980 in the validation cohort. The AUC was 0.871 in the independent testing data set. The AUCs of our radiomics signature to differentiate exon 19 and exon 21 mutations were 0.529, 0.580, 0.645, and 0.406 for T1-CE, T2-FLAIR, T2WI, and DWI, respectively. We developed a T2-FLAIR radiomics signature that can be used as a noninvasive auxiliary tool for predicting EGFR mutation status in lung adenocarcinoma, which is helpful to guide therapeutic strategies.                 • MR-based radiomics signature of brain metastasis may help predict EGFR mutation status in lung adenocarcinoma, especially using T2-FLAIR. • Nine radiomics features extracted from T2-FLAIR sequence strongly correlate with EGFR mutation status. • Radiomics features reflect tumor heterogeneity through potential changes in tissue morphology caused by EGFR mutation.","Guangyu Wang,Bomin Wang,Guangyu Wang,Bomin Wang,Zhou Wang,Wenchao Li,Zhou Wang,Jianjun Xiu,Wenchao Li,Zhi Li,Jianjun Xiu,Zhi Liu,Mingyong Han,Ming-Yong Han",European Radiology,2021.0

Materials and Methods: 76 patients (36 women and 40 men; 59 years of mean age and 36–80 years as range) were included in this retrospective study. Texture metrics and parameters based on lesion morphology were calculated. Per-patient univariate and multivariate analysis were made. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, pattern recognition approaches with features selection approaches were considered. Results: Significant results were obtained for texture features while morphological parameters had not significant results to classify RAS mutation. The results showed that using a univariate analysis was not possible to discriminate accurately the RAS mutation status. Instead, considering a multivariate analysis and classification approaches, a KNN exclusively with texture parameters as predictors reached the best results (AUC of 0.84 and an accuracy of 76.9% with 90.0% of sensitivity and 67.8% of specificity on training set and an accuracy of 87.5% with 91.7% of sensitivity and 83.3% of specificity on external validation cohort).

Only robust and stable features should be used in prognostication/prediction models to improve generalizability across multiple institutions. In this study, we investigated the repeatability and reproducibility of radiomic features with respect to three different scanners, variable slice thickness, tube current, and use of intravenous (IV) contrast medium, combining phantom studies and human subjects with non-small cell lung cancer. In all, half of the radiomic features showed good repeatability (ICC>0.9) independent of scanner model. Within acquisition protocols, changes in slice thickness was associated with poorer reproducibility compared to the use of IV contrast. Broad feature classes exhibit different behaviors, with only few features appearing to be the most stable. 108 features presented both good repeatability and reproducibility in all the experiments, most of them being wavelet and Laplacian of Gaussian features.","Ashish Kumar Jha,A.

Radiogenomics combines a large volume of quantitative data extracted from medical images with individual genomic phenotypes and constructs a prediction model through deep learning to stratify patients, guide therapeutic strategies, and evaluate clinical outcomes. Recent studies of various types of tumors demonstrate the predictive value of radiogenomics. And some of the issues in the radiogenomic analysis and the solutions from prior works are presented. Although the workflow criteria and international agreed guidelines for statistical methods need to be confirmed, radiogenomics represents a repeatable and cost-effective approach for the detection of continuous changes and is a promising surrogate for invasive interventions. Therefore, radiogenomics could facilitate computer-aided diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of the prognosis in patients with tumors in the routine clinical setting.

10.1155/2021/6668510,,,To Explore MR Imaging Radiomics for the Differentiation of Orbital Lymphoma and IgG4-Related Ophthalmic Disease.,"Among orbital lymphoproliferative disorders, about 55% of diagnosed cancerous tumors are orbital lymphomas, and nearly 50% of benign cases are immunoglobulin G4-related ophthalmic disease (IgG4-ROD). However, due to nonspecific characteristics, the differentiation of the two diseases is challenging. In this study, conventional magnetic resonance imaging-based radiomics approaches were explored for clinical recognition of orbital lymphomas and IgG4-ROD. We investigated the value of radiomics features of axial T1- (T1WI-) and T2-weighted (T2WI), contrast-enhanced T1WI in axial (CE-T1WI) and coronal (CE-T1WI-cor) planes, and 78 patients (orbital lymphoma, 36; IgG4-ROD, 42) were retrospectively reviewed. The mass lesions were manually annotated and represented with 99 features. The performance of elastic net-based radiomics models using single or multiple modalities with or without feature selection was compared. The demographic features showed orbital lymphoma patients were significantly older than IgG4-ROD patients ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1""> <mi>p</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.01</mn> </math> ), and most of the patients were male (72% in the orbital lymphoma group vs. 23% in the IgG4-ROD group; <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M2""> <mi>p</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0.03</mn> </math> ). The MR imaging findings revealed orbital lymphomas were mostly unilateral (81%, <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M3""> <mi>p</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0.02</mn> </math> ) and wrapped eyeballs or optic nerves frequently (78%, <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M4""> <mi>p</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0.02</mn> </math> ). In addition, orbital lymphomas showed isointense in T1WI (100%, <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M5""> <mi>p</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.01</mn> </math> ), and IgG4-ROD was isointense (60%, <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M6""> <mi>p</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.01</mn> </math> ) or hyperintense (40%, <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M7""> <mi>p</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.01</mn> </math> ) in T1WI with well-defined shape (64%, <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M8""> <mi>p</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.01</mn> </math> ). The experimental comparison indicated that using CE-T1WI radiomics features achieved superior results, and the features in combination with CE-T1WI-cor features and the feature preselection method could further improve the classification performance.

In this multi-institutional retrospective study, a CT radiomics metastasis score (RMS) was developed from a radiomics analysis cohort (n = 184) for distant metastasis prediction. Using a gene expression analysis cohort (n = 326), radiomics-associated gene modules were identified. Based on a radiogenomics discovery cohort (n = 42), key biological pathways were enriched from the gene modules. Furthermore, a multigene signature associated with RMS was constructed and validated on an independent radiogenomics validation cohort (n = 37). The 9-feature-based RMS predicted distant metastasis with an AUC of 0.861 in validation set and was independent with clinical factors (p < 0.001). A gene module comprising 114 genes was identified to be associated with all nine radiomics features (p < 0.05). Four enriched pathways were identified, including ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, protein digestion and absorption, and PI3K-Akt pathways. Most of them play important roles in tumor progression and metastasis. A 19-gene signature was constructed from the radiomics-associated gene module and predicted metastasis with an AUC of 0.843 in the radiogenomics validation cohort. CT radiomics features can predict distant metastasis after surgical resection of localized ccRCC while the predictive radiomics phenotypes may be driven by key biological pathways related to cancer progression and metastasis.                 • Radiomics features from primary tumor in preoperative CT predicted distant metastasis after surgical resection in patients with localized ccRCC.  • CT radiomics features predictive of distant metastasis were associated with key signaling pathways related to tumor progression and metastasis.  • Gene signature associated with radiomics metastasis score predicted distant metastasis in localized ccRCC.","Yuanshen Zhao,Yuanshen Zhao,Guiqin Liu,Yuanshen Zhao,Yuanshen Zhao,Qinjun Sun,Guiqin Liu,Qiuchang Sun,Guangtao Zhai,Guangyu Wu,Guangtao Zhai,Guang-yu Wu,Zhicheng Li,Guangyu Wu,Zhicheng Li",European Radiology,2021.0

Because the computation of these features is performed highly automated on medical images acquired during routine follow-up, radiomics offers this information at low cost. Further, the radiomics features can be used alone or combined with other clinical or histomolecular parameters to generate predictive or prognostic mathematical models. These models can then be applied for various important diagnostic indications in neuro-oncology, for example, to noninvasively predict relevant biomarkers in glioma patients, to differentiate between treatment-related changes and local brain tumor relapse, or to predict treatment response. In recent years, amino acid PET has become an important diagnostic tool in patients with brain tumors. Therefore, the number of studies in patients with brain tumors investigating the potential of PET radiomics or combined PET/MRI radiomics is steadily increasing.

10.1093/noajnl/vdaa054,,,Standardization of imaging methods for machine learning in neuro-oncology.,"Abstract Radiomics is a novel technique in which quantitative phenotypes or features are extracted from medical images. Machine learning enables analysis of large quantities of medical imaging data generated by radiomic feature extraction. A growing number of studies based on these methods have developed tools for neuro-oncology applications. Despite the initial promises, many of these imaging tools remain far from clinical implementation. One major limitation hindering the use of these models is their lack of reproducibility when applied across different institutions and clinical settings. In this article, we discuss the importance of standardization of methodology and reporting in our effort to improve reproducibility. Ongoing efforts of standardization for neuro-oncological imaging are reviewed. Challenges related to standardization and potential disadvantages in over-standardization are also described. Ultimately, greater multi-institutional collaborative effort is needed to provide and implement standards for data acquisition and analysis methods to facilitate research results to be interoperable and reliable for integration into different practice environments.","Xiaotian Li,Raymond Y.

In this study, a radiomic approach was developed and applied on DBT images with the aim to reduce the number of benign calcifications addressed to biopsy and to give the radiologists a helpful decision support system during their diagnostic activity. This allows personalizing patient management on the basis of personalized risk. For this purpose, 49 patients showing microcalcifications on DBT images were retrospectively included, classified by BI-RADS (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System) and analyzed. After segmentation of microcalcifications from DBT images, radiomic features were extracted. Features were then selected with respect to their stability within different segmentations and their repeatability in test–retest studies.

This review focuses on challenges points to be clarified about how to develop AI applications as clinical decision support systems in the real-world context.    Methods  A narrative review has been performed including a critical assessment of articles published between 1989 and 2021 that guided challenging sections.

DL models are presented as multi-layered artificial/convolutional neural networks, allowing us to directly process images. The data curation section includes technical steps such as image labelling, image annotation (with segmentation as a crucial step in radiomics), data harmonization (enabling compensation for differences in imaging protocols that typically generate noise in non-AI imaging studies) and federated learning. Thereafter, we dedicate specific sections to: sample size calculation, considering multiple testing in AI approaches; procedures for data augmentation to work with limited and unbalanced datasets; and the interpretability of AI models (the so-called black box issue). Pros and cons for choosing ML versus DL to implement AI applications to medical imaging are finally presented in a synoptic way.    Conclusions  Biomedicine and healthcare systems are one of the most important fields for AI applications and medical imaging is probably the most suitable and promising domain. Clarification of specific challenging points facilitates the development of such systems and their translation to clinical practice.","Isabella Castiglioni,Leonardo Rundo,Isabella Castiglioni,Marina Codari,Leonardo Rundo,Marina Codari,Giovanni Di Leo,Christian Salvatore,Giovanni Di Leo,Christian Salvatore,Matteo Interlenghi,Matteo Interlenghi,Francesca Gallivanone,Francesca Gallivanone,Andrea Cozzi,Natascha Claudia D’Amico,Andrea Cozzi,Francesco Sardanelli,Natascha Claudia D'Amico,Francesco Sardanelli",Physica Medica,2021.0
10.1016/j.suronc.2021.101578,33866191.0,,Advanced image analytics predicting clinical outcomes in patients with colorectal liver metastases: A systematic review of the literature.,"Abstract   Background  To better select patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) for an optimal selection of treatment strategy (i.e. local, systemic or combined treatment) new prognostic models are warranted. In the last decade, radiomics has emerged as a field to create predictive models based on imaging features. This systematic review aims to investigate the current state and potential of radiomics to predict clinical outcomes in patients with CRLM.    Methods  A comprehensive literature search was conducted in the electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, according to PRISMA guidelines. Original studies reporting on radiomics predicting clinical outcome in patients diagnosed with CRLM were included. Clinical outcomes were defined as response to systemic treatment, recurrence of disease, and survival (overall, progression-free, disease-free). Primary outcome was the predictive performance of radiomics. A narrative synthesis of the results was made. Methodological quality was assessed using the radiomics quality score.    Results  In 11 out of 14 included studies, radiomics was predictive for response to treatment, recurrence of disease, survival, or a combination of outcomes. Combining clinical parameters and radiomic features in multivariate modelling often improved the predictive performance. Different types of individual features were found prognostic. Noticeable were the contrary levels of heterogeneous and homogeneous features in patients with good response. The methodological quality as assessed by the radiomics quality score varied considerably between studies.    Conclusion  Radiomics appears a promising non-invasive method to predict clinical outcome and improve personalized decision-making in patients with CRLM. However, results were contradictory and difficult to compare. Standardized prospective studies are warranted to establish the added value of radiomics in patients with CRLM.","Nina J. Wesdorp,Nina J.

The high number of detected lesions poses a significant logistic challenge in clinical practice. The aim was to evaluate a temporally and spatially resolved (4D) radiomics approach to distinguish benign from malignant enhancing breast lesions and thereby avoid unnecessary biopsies. This retrospective study included consecutive patients with MRI-suspicious findings (BI-RADS 4/5). Two blinded readers analyzed DCE images using a commercially available software, automatically extracting BI-RADS curve types and pharmacokinetic enhancement features. After principal component analysis (PCA), a neural network–derived A.I. classifier to discriminate benign from malignant lesions was constructed and tested using a random split simple approach. The rate of avoidable biopsies was evaluated at exploratory cutoffs (C1, 100%, and C2, ≥ 95% sensitivity). Four hundred seventy (295 malignant) lesions in 329 female patients (mean age 55.1 years, range 18–85 years) were examined. Eighty-six DCE features were extracted based on automated volumetric lesion analysis. Five independent component features were extracted using PCA. The A.I. classifier achieved a significant (p < .001) accuracy to distinguish benign from malignant lesion within the test sample (AUC: 83.5%; 95% CI: 76.8–89.0%). Applying identified cutoffs on testing data not included in training dataset showed the potential to lower the number of unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions by 14.5% (C1) and 36.2% (C2). The investigated automated 4D radiomics approach resulted in an accurate A.I. classifier able to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions. Its application could have avoided unnecessary biopsies.                 • Principal component analysis of the extracted volumetric and temporally resolved (4D) DCE markers favored pharmacokinetic modeling derived features. • An A.I. classifier based on 86 extracted DCE features achieved a good to excellent diagnostic performance as measured by the area under the ROC curve with 80.6% (training dataset) and 83.5% (testing dataset). • Testing the resulting A.I. classifier showed the potential to lower the number of unnecessary biopsies of benign breast lesions by up to 36.2%, p < .001 at the cost of up to 4.5% (n = 4) false negative low-risk cancers.","Nina Pötsch,Nina Pötsch,Matthias Dietzel,Panagiotis Kapetas,Matthias Dietzel,Matthias Dietzel,Matthias Dietzel,Paola Clauser,Panagiotis Kapetas,Paola Clauser,Katja Pinker,Stephan Ellmann,Katja Pinker,Michael Uder,Stephan Ellmann,Thomas H.

10.1016/j.compmedimag.2021.101894,,,An imageomics and multi-network based deep learning model for risk assessment of liver transplantation for hepatocellular cancer.,"Abstract   Introduction  Liver transplantation (LT) is an effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of primary liver cancer. Patients with small HCC ( 5cm), we developed a convergent artificial intelligence (AI) model that combines transient clinical data with quantitative histologic and radiomic features for more objective risk assessment of liver transplantation for HCC patients.    Methods  Patients who received a LT for HCC between 2008-2019 were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. All patients with post-LT recurrence were included, and those without recurrence were randomly selected for inclusion in the deep learning model. Pre- and post-transplant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and reports were compressed using CapsNet networks and natural language processing, respectively, as input for a multiple feature radial basis function network. We applied a histological image analysis algorithm to detect pathologic areas of interest from explant tissue of patients who recurred. The multilayer perceptron was designed as a feed-forward, supervised neural network topology, with the final assessment of recurrence risk. We used area under the curve (AUC) and F-1 score to assess the predictability of different network combinations.    Results  A total of 109 patients were included (87 in the training group, 22 in the testing group), of which 20 were positive for cancer recurrence. Seven models (AUC; F-1 score) were generated, including clinical features only (0.55; 0.52), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) only (0.64; 0.61), pathological images only (0.64; 0.61), MRI plus pathology (0.68; 0.65), MRI plus clinical (0.78, 0.75), pathology plus clinical (0.77; 0.73), and a combination of clinical, MRI, and pathology features (0.87; 0.84). The final combined model showed 80% recall and 89% precision. The total accuracy of the implemented model was 82%.    Conclusion  We validated that the deep learning model combining clinical features and multi-scale histopathologic and radiomic image features can be used to discover risk factors for recurrence beyond tumor size and biomarker analysis. Such a predictive, convergent AI model has the potential to alter the LT allocation system for HCC patients and expand the transplantation treatment option to patients with HCC of the highest tumor burden.","Tiancheng He,Joy Nolte Fong,Tiancheng He,Joy V.

10.1186/s40644-021-00400-y,33827699.0,,Are radiomics features universally applicable to different organs,"Background  Many studies have successfully identified radiomics features reflecting macroscale tumor features and tumor microenvironment for various organs. There is an increased interest in applying these radiomics features found in a given organ to other organs. Here, we explored whether common radiomics features could be identified over target organs in vastly different environments.  Methods  Four datasets of three organs were analyzed. One radiomics model was constructed from the training set (lungs, n = 401), and was further evaluated in three independent test sets spanning three organs (lungs, n = 59; kidneys, n = 48; and brains, n = 43). Intensity histograms derived from the whole organ were compared to establish organ-level differences. We constructed a radiomics score based on selected features using training lung data over the tumor region. A total of 143 features were computed for each tumor. We adopted a feature selection approach that favored stable features, which can also capture survival. The radiomics score was applied to three independent test data from lung, kidney, and brain tumors, and whether the score could be used to separate high- and low-risk groups, was evaluated.  Results  Each organ showed a distinct pattern in the histogram and the derived parameters (mean and median) at the organ-level. The radiomics score trained from the lung data of the tumor region included seven features, and the score was only effective in stratifying survival for other lung data, not in other organs such as the kidney and brain. Eliminating the lung-specific feature (2.5 percentile) from the radiomics score led to similar results. There were no common features between training and test sets, but a common category of features (texture category) was identified.  Conclusion  Although the possibility of a generally applicable model cannot be excluded, we suggest that radiomics score models for survival were mostly specific for a given organ; applying them to other organs would require careful consideration of organ-specific properties.","Seung-Hak Lee,Seung-Hak Lee,H.

10.3390/cancers13071524,,,Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Prostate Cancer Detection through Dual-Channel Tissue Feature Engineering.,"The optimal diagnostic and treatment strategies for prostate cancer (PCa) are constantly changing. Given the importance of accurate diagnosis, texture analysis of stained prostate tissues is important for automatic PCa detection. We used artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to classify dual-channel tissue features extracted from Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) tissue images, respectively. Tissue feature engineering was performed to extract first-order statistic (FOS)-based textural features from each stained channel, and cancer classification between benign and malignant was carried out based on important features. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods were used to identify significant features, which provided the best five features out of the extracted six features. The AI techniques used in this study for binary classification (benign vs. malignant and low-grade vs. high-grade) were support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), bagging tree, boosting tree, and dual-channel bidirectional long short-term memory (DC-BiLSTM) network. Further, a comparative analysis was carried out between the AI algorithms. Two different datasets were used for PCa classification. Out of these, the first dataset (private) was used for training and testing the AI models and the second dataset (public) was used only for testing to evaluate model performance. The automatic AI classification system performed well and showed satisfactory results according to the hypothesis of this study.","Cho-Hee Kim,Cho-Hee Kim,Subrata Bhattacharjee,Subrata Bhattacharjee,Deekshitha Prakash,Suki Kang,Deekshitha Prakash,Nam Hoon Cho,Suki Kang,Nam Hoon Cho,Heecheol Kim,Hee-Cheol Kim,Heung‐Kook Choi,Heung-Kook Choi",Cancers,2021.0

Modern radiation oncology is based on the exploitation of advanced computational methods aiming to personalization and high diagnostic and therapeutic precision. The quantity of the available imaging data and the increased developments of Machine Learning (ML), particularly Deep Learning (DL), triggered the research on uncovering “hidden” biomarkers and quantitative features from anatomical and functional medical images. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved outstanding performance and broad implementation in image processing tasks. Lately, DNNs have been considered for radiomics and their potentials for explainable AI (XAI) may help classification and prediction in clinical practice. However, most of them are using limited datasets and lack generalized applicability. In this study we review the basics of radiomics feature extraction, DNNs in image analysis, and major interpretability methods that help enable explainable AI. Furthermore, we discuss the crucial requirement of multicenter recruitment of large datasets, increasing the biomarkers variability, so as to establish the potential clinical value of radiomics and the development of robust explainable AI models.","Panagiotis Papadimitroulas,Panagiotis Papadimitroulas,Lennart Brocki,Lennart Brocki,Lennart Brocki,Neo Christopher Chung,Wistan Marchadour,Neo Christopher Chung,Wistan Marchadour,Franck Vermet,Franck Vermet,Laurent Gaubert,Laurent Gaubert,Vasilis Eleftheriadis,Vasilis Eleftheriadis,Dimitris Plachouris,Dimitris Plachouris,Dimitris Visvikis,Dimitris Visvikis,George C.

PURPOSE To investigate whether T2 mapping could improve repeatability, reproducibility, and performances of radiomics compared to conventional T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). STUDY TYPE Prospective. SUBJECTS Twenty-six healthy adults. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE Respiratory-trigged radial turbo spin echo (TSE) multiecho T2 mapping (prototype) and conventional TSE T2WI of the abdomen were acquired twice at 1.5T. ASSESSMENT T2 maps were reconstructed using a two-parameter exponential fitting model. Volumes-of-interest (VOIs) were manually drawn in six tissues: liver, kidney, pancreas, muscle, bone, and spleen. After co-registration, conventional T2WIs were processed with two IHTs (standardization [std] and histogram-matching [HM]) resulting in four paired input image types: initial T2WI, T2WIstd , T2WIHM , and T2-map. VOIs were propagated to extract 45 RFs from MRI-1 and MRI-2 of each image type (LIFEx, v5.10). STATISTICAL TESTS Influence of the input data type on RF values was evaluated with analysis of variance. RFs test-retest repeatability and reproducibility over multiple segmentations were evaluated with intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Correlations between k-means clusters and the six tissues depending on the RFs dataset were investigated with adjusted-Rand-index (ARI). RESULTS About 41 of 45 (91.1%) RFs were significantly influenced by the input image type (P values<0.05), which was the most influential factor on repeatability of RFs (P-value<0.05). Repeatability ICCs from T2-map displayed intermediate values between the initial T2WI (range: 0.407-0.736) and the T2WIHM (range: 0.724-0.817). The number of RFs with interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility ICCs≥0.90 was 37/45 (82.2%) for T2WIHM , 33/45 (73.3%) for T2WIstd , 31/45 (68.9%) for T2 map, and 25/45 (55.6%) for the initial T2WI. T2 map provided the best tissue discrimination (ARI = 0.414 vs. 0.157 with T2WIHM ). DATA CONCLUSION T2 mapping provided RFs with moderate to substantial repeatability and reproducibility ICCs, along with the most preserved discriminative information.

One hundred sixty-five patients with vertebral compression fractures were allocated to training (n = 110 [62 acute benign and 48 malignant fractures]) and validation (n = 55 [30 acute benign and 25 malignant fractures]) cohorts. Radiomics features (n = 144) were extracted from non-contrast-enhanced CT images. Radiomics score was constructed by applying least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression to reproducible features. A combined radiomics-clinical model was constructed by integrating significant clinical parameters with radiomics score using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Model performance was quantified in terms of discrimination and calibration. The model was internally validated on the independent data set. The combined radiomics-clinical model, composed of two significant clinical predictors (age and history of malignancy) and the radiomics score, showed good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, p > 0.05) and discrimination in both training (AUC, 0.970) and validation (AUC, 0.948) cohorts. Discrimination performance of the combined model was higher than that of either the radiomics score (AUC, 0.941 in training cohort and 0.852 in validation cohort) or the clinical predictor model (AUC, 0.924 in training cohort and 0.849 in validation cohort). The model stratified patients into groups with low and high risk of malignant fracture with an accuracy of 98.2% in the training cohort and 90.9% in the validation cohort. The combined radiomics-clinical model integrating clinical parameters with radiomics score could predict malignancy in vertebral compression fractures on CT with high discriminatory ability.                 • A combined radiomics-clinical model was constructed to predict malignancy of vertebral compression fractures on CT by combining clinical parameters and radiomics features.  • The model showed good calibration and discrimination in both training and validation cohorts. • The model showed high accuracy in the stratification of patients into groups with low and high risk of malignant vertebral compression fractures.","Choong Guen Chee,Choong Guen Chee,Min Ho Yoon,Min A Yoon,Kyung Won Kim,Yusun Ko,Kyung Won Kim,Su Jung Ham,Yusun Ko,Su Jung Ham,Young Chul Cho,Bumwoo Park,Young Chul Cho,Hye Won Chung,Bumwoo Park,Hye Won Chung",European Radiology,2021.0
10.2214/ajr.20.23255,33826360.0,,Comparison of Conventional Gadoxetate Disodium-Enhanced MRI Features and Radiomics Signatures With Machine Learning for Diagnosing Microvascular Invasion.,"OBJECTIVE. This study aimed to determine the best model for predicting microvascular invasion (MVI) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using conventional gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (gadoxetate disodium)-enhanced MRI features and radiomics signatures with machine learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included 269 patients with a postoperative pathologic diagnosis of HCC. Gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI features were assessed, including T1 relaxation time, tumor margin, tumor size, peritumoral enhancement, peritumoral hypointensity, and ADC. Radiomics models were constructed and validated by machine learning. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used for feature selection, and radiomics-based LASSO models were constructed with six classifiers. Predictive capability was assessed using the ROC AUC. RESULTS. Histologic examination confirmed MVI in 111 (41.3%) of the 269 patients. ADC value, nonsmooth tumor margin, and 20-minute T1 relaxation time showed diagnostic accuracy with AUC values of 0.850, 0.847, and 0.846, respectively (p < .05 for all). A total of 1395 quantitative imaging features were extracted. In the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) model, the support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression (LR) classifiers showed greater diagnostic efficiency for predicting MVI, with AUCs of 0.942, 0.938, and 0.936, respectively (p < .05 for all). CONCLUSION. ADC value, nonsmooth tumor margin, and 20-minute T1 relaxation time show high diagnostic accuracy for predicting MVI. Radiomics signatures with machine learning can further improve the ability to predict MVI and are best modeled during HBP. The SVM, XGBoost, and LR classifiers may serve as potential biomarkers to evaluate MVI.","Yidi Chen,Yuwei Xia,Yidi Chen,Parag Tolat,Yuwei Xia,Parag Tolat,Liling Long,Liling Long,Liling Long,Zijian Jiang,Zijian Jiang,Huang Zhongkui,Zhong-kui Huang,Zhongkui Huang,Qin Tang,Qin Tang",American Journal of Roentgenology,2021.0

10.3389/fonc.2020.598721,,,Deep CNN Model Using CT Radiomics Feature Mapping Recognizes EGFR Gene Mutation Status of Lung Adenocarcinoma.,"To recognize the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation status in lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) has become a prerequisite of deciding whether EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) medicine can be used. Polymerase chain reaction assay or gene sequencing is for measuring EGFR status, however, the tissue samples by surgery or biopsy are required. We propose to develop deep learning models to recognize EGFR status by using radiomics features extracted from non-invasive CT images. Preoperative CT images, EGFR mutation status and clinical data have been collected in a cohort of 709 patients (the primary cohort) and an independent cohort of 205 patients. After 1037 CT-based radiomics features are extracted from each lesion region, 784 discriminative features are selected for analysis and construct a feature mapping. One Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Convolutional Neural Network (SE-CNN) has been designed and trained to recognize EGFR status from the radiomics feature mapping. SE-CNN model is trained and validated by using 638 patients from the primary cohort, tested by using the rest 71 patients (the internal test cohort), and further tested by using the independent 205 patients (the external test cohort). Furthermore, SE-CNN model is compared with machine learning (ML) models using radiomics features, clinical features, and both features. EGFR(-) patients show the smaller age, higher odds of female, larger lesion volumes, and lower odds of subtype of acinar predominant adenocarcinoma (APA), compared with EGFR(+). The most discriminative features are for texture (614, 78.3%) and the features of first order of intensity (158, 20.1%) and the shape features (12, 1.5%) follow. SE-CNN model can recognize EGFR mutation status with an AUC of 0.910 and 0.841 for the internal and external test cohorts, respectively. It outperforms the CNN model without SE, the fine-tuned VGG16 and VGG19, three ML models, and the state-of-art models. Utilizing radiomics feature mapping extracted from non-invasive CT images, SE-CNN can precisely recognize EGFR mutation status of LADC patients. The proposed method combining radiomics features and deep leaning is superior to ML methods and can be expanded to other medical applications. The proposed SE-CNN model may help make decision on usage of EGFR-TKI medicine.","Baihua Zhang,Baihua Zhang,Baihua Zhang,Shouliang Qi,Shouliang Qi,Qi Shouliang,Pan Xu,Xiaohuan Pan,Chen Li,Yu-Dong Yao,Chen Li,Chen Li,Yu-Dong Yao,Wei Qian,Yubao Guan,Wei Qian,Yubao Guan,Yubao Guan,Yubao Guan",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0

Methods This retrospective study enrolled 592 patients with clinicopathologically confirmed GA (low-grade: n=154; high-grade: n=438) from January 2008 to March 2018 who were divided into training (n=450) and validation (n=142) sets according to the time of computed tomography (CT) examination. Radiomic features were extracted from the portal venous phase CT images. The Mann-Whitney U test and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model were used for feature selection, data dimension reduction and radiomics signature construction. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to develop the prediction model. The radiomics signature and independent clinicopathologic risk factors were incorporated and presented as a radiomics nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was assessed with respect to its calibration and discrimination. Results A radiomics signature containing 12 selected features was significantly associated with the histologic grade of GA (P<0.001 for both training and validation sets). A nomogram including the radiomics signature and tumor location as predictors was developed.

10.1101/2021.02.24.21252123,,,Development of web-based quality-assurance tool for radiotherapy target delineation for head and neck cancer: quality evaluation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"Purpose: We developed QUANNOTATE, a new web-application for rapid review of radiotherapy (RT) target volumes, and used it to evaluate the relationship between target delineation compliance with the international guidelines and treatment outcomes in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients undergoing definitive RT. Methods and Materials: The dataset used for this study consists of anonymized CT simulation scans, RT structures, and clinical data of 332 pathologically confirmed NPC patients treated with intensity-modulated RT between July 2005 and August 2017. We imported the contours of intermediate risk clinical target volumes of the primary tumor (IR-CTVp) receiving 56 Gy into QUANNOTATE. We determined inclusion of anatomic sites within IR-CTVp in accordance with 2018 International guideline for CTV delineation for NPC and correlated the results with time to local failure (TTLF) using Cox-regression. Results: At a median follow-up of 5.6 years, 5-year TTLF and overall survival rates were 93.1% and 85.9% respectively. The most frequently non-guideline compliant anatomic sites were sphenoid sinus (n = 69, 20.8%), followed by cavernous sinus (n = 38, 19.3%), left and right petrous apices (n = 37 and 32, 11.1% and 9.6%), clivus (n = 14, 4.2%), and right and left foramen rotundum (n = 14 and 12, 4.2% and 3.6%). Among 23 patients with a local failure (6.9%), the number of non-compliant cases were 8 for sphenoid sinus, 7 cavernous sinus, 4 left and 3 right petrous apices, and 2 clivus. Compared to conforming cases, cases which did not contour the cavernous sinus had a higher local failure (LF) rate (89.1% vs 93.6%, p= 0.013). Multivariable analysis confirmed that lack of cavernous sinus contouring was prognostic for LF. Conclusions: QUANNOTATE allowed rapid review of target volumes in a large patient cohort. Despite an overall high compliance with the international guidelines, undercoverage of the cavernous sinus was correlated with LF.","Jun Won Kim,J. W.

Methods  This retrospective study included 3,605 consecutive, emergent, adult noncontrast head CT scans performed between July 1, 2019, and December 30, 2019, at our institution (51% female subjects, mean age of 61 ± 21 years). Each scan was evaluated for ICH by both a certificate of added qualification certified neuroradiologist and Aidoc. We determined the diagnostic accuracy of the AI model and performed a failure mode analysis with quantitative CT radiomic image characterization.    Results  Of the 3,605 scans, 349 cases of ICH (9.7% of studies) were identified. The neuroradiologist and Aidoc interpretations were concordant in 96.9% of cases and the overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 92.3%, 97.7%, 81.3%, and 99.2%, respectively, with sensitivity and positive predictive values unexpectedly lower than in previously reported studies. Prior neurosurgery, type of ICH, and number of ICHs were significantly associated with decreased model performance. Quantitative image characterization with CT radiomics failed to reveal significant differences between concordant and discordant studies.    Discussion.  This study revealed decreased diagnostic accuracy of an AI DSS at our institution. Despite extensive evaluation, we were unable to identify the source of this discrepancy, raising concerns about the generalizability of these tools with indeterminate failure modes. These results further highlight the need for standardized study design to allow for rigorous and reproducible site-to-site comparison of emerging deep learning technologies.","Andrew F.

The MELD score is compiled solely by blood parameters, and so far, it was not investigated if extracted image-based features have the potential to reflect severity to potentially complement the calculated score. This was a retrospective study of eligible patients with cirrhosis ( $$n=90$$) who underwent a contrast-enhanced MR screening protocol for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening at a tertiary academic center from 2015 to 2018. Radiomic feature analyses were used to train four prediction models for assessing the patient’s condition at time of scan: MELD score, MELD score                                                                   $$\ge $$ 9 (median score of the cohort), MELD score                                                                   $$\ge $$ 15 (the inflection between the risk and benefit of transplant), and clinical decompensation. Liver and spleen segmentations were used for feature extraction, followed by cross-validated random forest classification. Radiomic features of the liver and spleen were most predictive of clinical decompensation (AUC 0.84), which the MELD score could predict with an AUC of 0.78. Using liver or spleen features alone had slightly lower discrimination ability (AUC of 0.82 for liver and AUC of 0.78 for spleen features only), although this was not statistically significant on our cohort. When radiomic prediction models were trained to predict continuous MELD scores, there was poor correlation. When stratifying risk by splitting our cohort at the median MELD 9 or at MELD 15, our models achieved AUCs of 0.78 or 0.66, respectively. We demonstrated that MRI-based radiomic features of the liver and spleen have the potential to predict the severity of liver cirrhosis, using decompensation or MELD status as imperfect surrogate measures for disease severity.","Jennifer Nitsch,Jennifer Nitsch,Jordan Sack,Jordan Sack,Morris Halle,Michael Halle,Michael Halle,Jan Hendrik Moltz,Jan Hendrik Moltz,April Wall,April Wall,Anna E.

10.1093/noajnl/vdab042,,,MRI-based radiomics for prognosis of pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma: an international study.,"Background Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) are lethal pediatric brain tumors. Presently, MRI is the mainstay of disease diagnosis and surveillance. We identify clinically significant computational features from MRI and create a prognostic machine learning model. Methods We isolated tumor volumes of T1-post-contrast (T1) and T2-weighted (T2) MRIs from 177 treatment-naive DIPG patients from an international cohort for model training and testing. The Quantitative Image Feature Pipeline and PyRadiomics was used for feature extraction. Ten-fold cross-validation of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression selected optimal features to predict overall survival in the training dataset and tested in the independent testing dataset. We analyzed model performance using clinical variables (age at diagnosis and sex) only, radiomics only, and radiomics plus clinical variables. Results All selected features were intensity and texture-based on the wavelet-filtered images (3 T1 gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features, T2 GLCM texture feature, and T2 first-order mean). This multivariable Cox model demonstrated a concordance of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.61-0.74) in the training dataset, significantly outperforming the clinical-only model (C = 0.57 [95% CI: 0.49-0.64]). Adding clinical features to radiomics slightly improved performance (C = 0.70 [95% CI: 0.64-0.77]). The combined radiomics and clinical model was validated in the independent testing dataset (C = 0.59 [95% CI: 0.51-0.67], Noether's test P = .02). Conclusions In this international study, we demonstrate the use of radiomic signatures to create a machine learning model for DIPG prognostication. Standardized, quantitative approaches that objectively measure DIPG changes, including computational MRI evaluation, could offer new approaches to assessing tumor phenotype and serve a future role for optimizing clinical trial eligibility and tumor surveillance.","Lydia Tam,Lydia T.

Methods The mpMRI included non-enhanced and enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), Ktrans, Kep, Ve, Vp. Regions of interest were annotated in an enhanced T1WI map and mapped to other maps in every slice. 1,132 features and top-10 principal components were extracted from every parameter map. Single-parametric and multi-parametric ML models were constructed via 10 rounds of 5-fold cross-validation. The model with the highest area under the curve (AUC) was considered as the optimal model and validated by calibration curve and decision curve. Nomogram was built with the optimal ML model and patients’ characteristics. Results This study involved 144 malignant lesions and 66 benign lesions. The average age of patients with benign and malignant lesions was 42.5 and 50.8 respectively, which were statistically different. The sixth and fourth principal components of Ktrans had more importance than others.

However, recent data demonstrating brain gadolinium deposits have raised safety concerns. We developed and validated a machine-learning (ML) method that incorporates features extracted from cine to identify HCM patients without fibrosis in whom gadolinium can be avoided.  Methods and results  An XGBoost ML model was developed using regional wall thickness and thickening, and radiomic features of myocardial signal intensity, texture, size, and shape from cine. A CMR dataset containing 1099 HCM patients collected using 1.5T CMR scanners from different vendors and centres was used for model development (n=882) and validation (n=217). Among the 2613 radiomic features, we identified 7 features that provided best discrimination between +LGE and -LGE using 10-fold stratified cross-validation in the development cohort. Subsequently, an XGBoost model was developed using these radiomic features, regional wall thickness and thickening. In the independent validation cohort, the ML model yielded an area under the curve of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.77-0.89), sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 62%, F1-score of 77%, true negatives rate (TNR) of 34%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 89%. Optimization for sensitivity provided sensitivity of 96%, F2-score of 83%, TNR of 19% and NPV of 91%; false negatives halved from 4% to 2%.

To perform a meta-analysis of machine learning studies for the prediction of intracranial meningioma grading from pre-operative brain MRI. METHODS Articles published from the year 2000 on radiomics and machine learning applications in brain imaging of meningioma patients were included. Their methodological quality was assessed by three readers with the radiomics quality score, using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) to evaluate inter-reader reproducibility. A meta-analysis of machine learning studies for the preoperative evaluation of meningioma grading was performed and their risk of bias was assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. RESULTS In all, 23 studies were included in the systematic review, 8 of which were suitable for the meta-analysis. Total (possible range, -8 to 36) and percentage radiomics quality scores were respectively 6.96 ± 4.86 and 19 ± 13% with a moderate to good inter-reader reproducibility (ICC = 0.75, 95% confidence intervals, 95%CI = 0.54-0.88). The meta-analysis showed an overall AUC of 0.88 (95%CI = 0.84-0.93) with a standard error of 0.02.

10.33612/diss.149306583,,,Methodological aspects and standardization of PET radiomics studies,"Personalized cancer therapies are one of the main promises of modern medicine. The analysis of patient genetics on the one hand and tumor phenotype extracted from medical images on the other hand could provide important information on treatment response or resistancy of a tumor and could help to guide physicians in selecting the most adequate therapy. The rapidly emerging field radiomics aims to describe the tumor phenotype by calculating a large number of image biomarkers (radiomic features) describing the tumor phenotype in a medical image. Radiomics could therefore play an important role in future clinical decision making. The imaging modality PET (Positron emission tomography) is visualizing underlying biological processes and is frequently used for cancer diagnosis, cancer staging, and prognosis. Several studies reported on the promising value of radiomic features extracted from PET images regarding diagnosis or treatment response assessment. However, to date, radiomic features are only used for scientific purposes but are not yet implemented in the clinic. This is due to several challenges coming with radiomics. One of them is the low reproducibilty of radiomic features. I.e. if the same patient would be scanned in two different hospitals, a large number of radiomic features would result in large differences across hospitals. Therefore, in each hospital the physician would draw a different conclusion. By standardizing image acquisition, reconstruction and, pre-processing, a large number of radiomic features can be harmonized so that images from different center become comparable. To standardize the steps in the radiomic workflow and to get one step closer to the clinical application of radiomics was the aim of this thesis.","Elisabeth Pfaehler,Elisabeth Pfaehler,Elisabeth Pfaehler",,2021.0

Methods: 186 rectal adenocarcinoma patients from our retrospective study cohort were randomly selected as the training (n = 123) and testing cohorts (n = 63). Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were used for feature selection and dimensionality reduction. Five support vector machine (SVM) classification models were built using selected clinical and semantic variables, single-regional radiomics features, multiregional radiomics features, and combinations, for predicting LN metastasis in rectal cancer. The performance of the five SVM models was evaluated via the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the testing cohort. Differences in the AUCs among the five models were compared using DeLong’s test. Results: The clinical, single-regional radiomics, and multiregional radiomics models showed good predictive performance and diagnostic accuracy in predicting LN metastasis with an AUC of 0.725, 0.702, and 0.736, respectively. A model with improved performance was created by combining clinical data with single-regional radiomics features (AUC = 0.827, (95% CI, 0.711–0.911), P = 0.016). Incorporating clinical data with multiregional radiomics features also improved the performance (AUC = 0.832 (95% CI, 0.717-0.915), P = 0.015). Conclusion: Multiregional-based MRI radiomics combined with clinical data can improve efficacy in predicting LN metastasis and could be a useful tool to guide surgical decision-making in patients with rectal cancer.","Xiangchun Liu,Xiangchun Liu,Qi Yang,Chunyu Zhang,Qi Yang,Chunyu Zhang,Jianqing Sun,Jianqing Sun,Kan He,Yunming Xie,Kan He,Yiying Zhang,Yunming Xie,Yiying Zhang,Yu Fu,Yu Fu,Hua Zhang,Huimao Zhang,Huimao Zhang",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0
10.21203/rs.3.rs-243430/v1,,,Multivariate radiomics models based on 18F-FDG hybrid PET/MRI for distinguishing between Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy.,"PURPOSE To construct multivariate radiomics models using hybrid 18F-FDG PET/MRI for distinguishing between Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). METHODS Ninety patients (60 with PD and 30 with MSA) were randomized to training and test sets in a 7:3 ratio. All patients underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/MRI to simultaneously obtain metabolic images (18F-FDG), structural MRI images (T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2/FLAIR)) and functional MRI images (susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient). Using PET and five MRI sequences, we extracted 1172 radiomics features from the putamina and caudate nuclei. The radiomics signatures were constructed with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm in the training set, with progressive optimization through single-sequence and double-sequence radiomics models. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to develop a clinical-radiomics model, combining the optimal multi-sequence radiomics signature with clinical characteristics and SUV values. The diagnostic performance of the models was assessed by receiver operating characteristic and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS The radiomics signatures showed favourable diagnostic efficacy. The optimal model comprised structural (T1WI), functional (SWI) and metabolic (18F-FDG) sequences (RadscoreFDG_T1WI_SWI) with the area under curves (AUCs) of the training and test sets of 0.971 and 0.957, respectively. The integrated model, incorporating RadscoreFDG_T1WI_SWI, three clinical symptoms (disease duration, dysarthria and autonomic failure) and SUVmax, demonstrated satisfactory calibration and discrimination in the training and test sets (0.993 and 0.994, respectively).

10.1007/s00259-021-05211-8,33760957.0,,PET/CT imaging for evaluation of multimodal treatment efficacy and toxicity in advanced NSCLC—current state and future directions,"PURPOSE The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionized the treatment of advanced NSCLC, leading to a string of approvals in recent years. Herein, a narrative review on the role of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) in the ever-evolving treatment landscape of advanced NSCLC is presented. METHODS This comprehensive review will begin with an introduction into current treatment paradigms incorporating ICIs; the evolution of CT-based criteria; moving onto novel phenomena observed with ICIs and the current state of hybrid imaging for diagnosis, treatment planning, evaluation of treatment efficacy and toxicity in advanced NSCLC, also taking into consideration its limitations and future directions. CONCLUSIONS The advent of ICIs marks the dawn of a new era bringing forth new challenges particularly vis-a-vis treatment response assessment and observation of novel phenomena accompanied by novel systemic side effects. While FDG PET/CT is widely adopted for tumor volume delineation in locally advanced disease, response assessment to immunotherapy based on current criteria is of high clinical value but has its inherent limitations. In recent years, modifications of established (PET)/CT criteria have been proposed to provide more refined approaches towards response evaluation. Not only a comprehensive inclusion of PET-based response criteria in prospective randomized controlled trials, but also a general harmonization within the variety of PET-based response criteria is pertinent to strengthen clinical implementation and widespread use of hybrid imaging for response assessment in NSCLC.","Chukwuka Eze,Nina-Sophie Schmidt-Hegemann,Chukwuka Eze,Nina-Sophie Schmidt-Hegemann,L Sawicki,Julian Kirchner,Lino M.

10.3390/jcm10071430,,,Pre-Processing Method for Contouring the Uptake Levels of [18F] FDG for Enhanced Specificity of PET Imaging of Solitary Hypermetabolic Pulmonary Nodules.,"Background: The paper presents a pre-processing method which, based on positron-emission tomography (PET) images of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F] FDG) hypermetabolic pulmonary nodules, makes it possible to obtain additional visual characteristics and use them to enhance the specificity of imaging. Material and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 69 FDG-PET/CT scans of solitary hypermetabolic pulmonary nodules (40 cases of lung cancer and 29 benign tumours), where in each case, the standardised uptake value of the hottest voxel within the defined volume of interest was greater than 2.5 (SUVmax > 2.5). No diagnosis could be made based on these SUVmax values. All of the PET DICOM images were transformed by means of the pre-processing method for contouring the uptake levels of [18F] FDG (PCUL-FDG). Next, a multidimensional comparative analysis was conducted using a synthetic variable obtained by calculating the similarities based on the generalised distance measure for non-metric scaling (GDM2) from the pattern object. The calculations were performed with the use of the R language. Results: The PCUL-FDG method revealed 73.9% hypermetabolic nodules definitively diagnosed as either benign or malignant lesions. As for the other 26.1% of the nodules, there was uncertainty regarding their classification (some had features suggesting malignancy, while the characteristics of others made it impossible to confirm malignancy with a high degree of certainty). Conclusions: Application of the PCUL-FDG method enhances the specificity of PET in imaging solitary hypermetabolic pulmonary nodules. Images obtained using the PCUL-FDG method can serve as point of departure for automatic analysis of PET data based on convolutional neural networks.","Piotr Szumowski,Piotr Szumowski,Artur Szklarzewski,Łukasz Żukowski,Artur Szklarzewski,Saeid Abdelrazek,Łukasz Żukowski,Saeid Abdelrazek,Małgorzata Mojsak,Katarzyna Porębska,Małgorzata Mojsak,Katarzyna Porębska,Ewa Sierko,Janusz Myśliwiec,Ewa Sierko,Janusz Myśliwiec",Journal of Clinical Medicine,2021.0

In the present study, we predicted amyloid positivity with structural MRI using a radiomics approach. From MR images (including T1, T2 FLAIR, and DTI sequences) of 440 MCI patients, we extracted radiomics features composed of histogram and texture features. These features were used alone or in combination with baseline non-imaging predictors such as age, sex, and ApoE genotype to predict amyloid positivity. We used a regularized regression method for feature selection and prediction. The performance of the baseline non-imaging model was at a fair level (AUC=0.71). Among single MR-sequence models, T1 and T2 FLAIR radiomics models also showed fair performances (AUC for test=0.71-0.74, AUC for validation=0.68-0.70) in predicting amyloid positivity. When T1 and T2 FLAIR radiomics features were combined, the AUC for test was 0.75 and AUC for validation was 0.72 (p vs. baseline model<0.001). The model performed best when baseline features were combined with a T1 and T2 FLAIR radiomics model (AUC for test=0.79, AUC for validation=0.76), which was significantly better than those of the baseline model (p<0.001) and the T1+T2 FLAIR radiomics model (p<0.001). In conclusion, radiomics features showed predictive value for amyloid positivity. It can be used in combination with other predictive features and possibly improve the prediction performance.","Jun Pyo Kim,Jong‐Hoon Kim,Jun Pyo Kim,Hyemin Jang,Jonghoon Kim,Jae-Ho Kim,Hyemin Jang,Jaeho Kim,Sung Hoon Kang,Ji Young Kim,Ji Sun Kim,Sung Hoon Kang,Jongmin Lee,Ji Sun Kim,Jongmin Lee,Duk L.

10.15537/smj.2021.42.3.20200617,33632907.0,,Prediction of squamous cell carcinoma cases from squamous cell hyperplasia in throat lesions using CT radiomics model.,"Objectives:  To differentiate squamous cell hyperplasia (SCH) (benign) from squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) malignant) using textural features extracted from CT images and thereby, facilitate the preoperative medical diagnosis and treatment of throat cancers without the need for sample biopsies.  Methods:  In total, 100 throat cancer patients were selected for this retrospective study. The cases were collected from the Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China, from June 2017 to January 2019. The patients were separated into a training and validation cohort consisting of 70 and 30 cases, respectively. The Artificial Intelligence Kit software (A.K. software) was used to extract the radiomics features from the CT images. These features were further processed using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods to obtain a subset of optimal features. The radiomics model was validated based on area-under-the-curve (AUC) values, accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity using the R-studio software.  Results:  The diagnostic accuracy, specificity, PPV, NPV, and AUC values obtained for the training cohort was 0.91, 0.9, 0.93, 0.9, and 0.96 CT angiography (CTA), 0.93, 0.93, 0.95, 0.90, and 0.96 computed tomography normal (CTN), and 0.92, 0.87, 0.91, 0.96, and 0.96 CT venogram (CTV). These values were subsequently confirmed in the validation cohort.  Conclusion:  The radiomics-based prediction model proposed in this study successfully differentiated between SCH and SCC throat cancers using CT imaging, thereby facilitating the development of accurate preoperative diagnosis based on specific biomarkers and cancer phenotypes.","Osama A.

10.3389/fonc.2021.633596,,,Preoperative Prediction of Microvascular Invasion in Hepatocellular Carcinoma via Multi-Parametric MRI Radiomics,"To systematically evaluate and compare the predictive capability for microvascular invasion (MVI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients based on radiomics from multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) including six sequences when used individually or combined, and to establish and validate the optimal combined model.A total of 195 patients confirmed HCC were divided into training (n = 136) and validation (n = 59) datasets. All volumes of interest of tumors were respectively segmented on T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient, artery phase, portal venous phase, and delay phase sequences, from which quantitative radiomics features were extracted and analyzed individually or combined. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were undertaken to construct clinical model, respective single-sequence radiomics models, fusion radiomics models based on different sequences and combined model. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated to evaluate the performance of different models.Among nine radiomics models, the model from all sequences performed best with AUCs 0.889 and 0.822 in the training and validation datasets, respectively. The combined model incorporating radiomics from all sequences and effective clinical features achieved satisfactory preoperative prediction of MVI with AUCs 0.901 and 0.840, respectively, and could identify the higher risk population of MVI (P < 0.001). The Delong test manifested significant differences with P < 0.001 in the training dataset and P = 0.005 in the validation dataset between the combined model and clinical model.The combined model can preoperatively and noninvasively predict MVI in HCC patients and may act as a usefully clinical tool to guide subsequent individualized treatment.","Yang Zhang,Yang Zhang,Zhenyu Shu,Zhenyu Shu,Zhenyu Shu,Qin Ye,Qin Ye,Junfa Chen,Junfa Chen,Jianguo Zhong,Jianguo Zhong,Hongyang Jiang,Cuiyun Wu,Hongyang Jiang,Hongyang Jiang,Tao Yu,Cuiyun Wu,Peipei Pang,Taihen Yu,Peipei Pang,Tianshi Ma,Pei-Pei Pang,Chunmiao Lin,Tianshi Ma,Chunmiao Lin",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0
10.1002/brb3.2085,33624945.0,,Prognostic prediction of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage using CT radiomics and machine learning.,"OBJECTIVES Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage remains a major cause of death and disability throughout the world. We tried to establish accurate long-term outcome prediction models for hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH) using CT radiomics and machine learning. METHODS In a retrospective study of 270 patients with HICH between June 2013 and June 2018, CT images and patients' 6-month outcome based on the modified Rankin Scale were collected. Hematomas on CT images were selected as volumes of interests (VOIs), and 1,029 radiomics features of the VOIs were extracted. Based on correlations with patients' outcome, radiomics features underwent dimensionality reduction analyses. Then, the support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and XGBoost algorithms were applied with the screened features to establish prognostic prediction models of HICH. Accuracies of all models were compared. RESULTS Eighteen radiomics features were screened as prognosis-associated radiomics signature of HICH based on the variance threshold, SelectKBest, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression models. Patients were randomly allocated into training (n=215) and validation (n=55) sets. Accuracies of all 6 machine learning algorithms in the validation set exceeded 80%. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in the validation set were 93.3%, 92.5%, and 92.7% for the RF model and 92.3%, 88.1%, and 89.1% for the XGBoost model, respectively, which were the best two among all models. CONCLUSIONS Taking advantage of radiomics and machine learning, we established accurate prognostic prediction models of HICH. The RF model and XGBoost model returned the best accuracies.","Xinghua Xu,Xinghua Xu,Jiashu Zhang,Jiashu Zhang,Kai Yang,Kai Yang,Qun Wang,Xiaolei Chen,Qun Wang,Bainan Xu,Xiaolei Chen,Bainan Xu",Brain and behavior,2021.0

10.1016/j.ctro.2021.03.006,,,Radiomic biomarkers of tumor immune biology and immunotherapy response,"Abstract   Immunotherapies are leading to improved outcomes for many cancers, including those with devastating prognoses. As therapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) become a mainstay in treatment regimens, many concurrent challenges have arisen – for instance, delineating clinical responders from non-responders. Predicting response has proven to be difficult given a lack of consistent and accurate biomarkers, heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME), and a poor understanding of resistance mechanisms. For the most part, imaging data have remained an untapped, yet abundant, resource to address these challenges. In recent years, quantitative image analyses have highlighted the utility of medical imaging in predicting tumor phenotypes, prognosis, and therapeutic response. These studies have been fueled by an explosion of resources in high-throughput mining of image features (i.e. radiomics) and artificial intelligence. In this review, we highlight current progress in radiomics to understand tumor immune biology and predict clinical responses to immunotherapies. We also discuss limitations in these studies and future directions for the field, particularly if high-dimensional imaging data are to play a larger role in precision medicine.","Jarey Wang,Jarey Wang,Jarey H.

10.3389/fonc.2020.606741,,,Radiomics Features Predict Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase Promoter Mutations in World Health Organization Grade II Gliomas via a Machine-Learning Approach.,"The detection of mutations in telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter (pTERT) is important since preoperative diagnosis of pTERT status helps with evaluating prognosis and determining the surgical strategy. Here, we aimed to establish a radiomics-based machine-learning algorithm and evaluated its performance with regard to the prediction of mutations in pTERT in patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade II gliomas. In total, 164 patients with WHO grade II gliomas were enrolled in this retrospective study. We extracted a total of 1,293 radiomics features from multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging scans. Elastic net (used for feature selection) and support vector machine with linear kernel were applied in nested 10-fold cross-validation loops. The predictive model was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall analyses. We performed an unpaired t-test to compare the posterior predictive probabilities among patients with differing pTERT statuses. We selected 12 valuable radiomics features using nested 10-fold cross-validation loops. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.8446 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7735–0.9065) with an optimal summed value of sensitivity of 0.9355 (95% CI, 0.8802–0.9788) and specificity of 0.6197 (95% CI, 0.5071–0.7371). The overall accuracy was 0.7988 (95% CI, 0.7378–0.8598). The F1-score was 0.8406 (95% CI, 0.7684–0.902) with an optimal precision of 0.7632 (95% CI, 0.6818–0.8364) and recall of 0.9355 (95% CI, 0.8802–0.9788). Posterior probabilities of pTERT mutations were significantly different between patients with wild-type and mutant TERT promoters. Our findings suggest that a radiomics analysis with a machine-learning algorithm can be useful for predicting pTERT status in patients with WHO grade II glioma and may aid in glioma management.","Fang Sun,Shengyu Fang,Ziwen Fan,Ziwen Fan,Zimin Sun,Zhiyan Sun,Yiming Li,Xing Liu,Yiming Li,Yiming Li,Xing Liu,Yuan Liang,Yuchao Liang,Yukun Liu,Chunyao Zhou,Yukun Liu,Chunyao Zhou,Qiang Zhu,Qiang Zhu,Hong Zhang,Tianshi Li,Hong Zhang,Shaowu Li,Tianshi Li,Tao Jiang,Shaowu Li,Yinyan Wang,Tao Jiang,Yongjun Wang,Yinyan Wang,Lei Wang,Lei Wang",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0
10.21037/tlcr-20-708,,,Radiomics and artificial intelligence in lung cancer screening,"Lung cancer is responsible for more fatalities than any other cancer worldwide, with 1.76 million associated deaths reported in 2018. The key issue in the fight against this disease is the detection and diagnosis of all pulmonary nodules at an early stage. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms play a vital role in the automated detection, segmentation, and computer-aided diagnosis of malignant lesions. Among the existing algorithms, radiomics and deep-learning-based types appear to show the most promise. Radiomics is a growing field related to the extraction of a set of features from an image, which allows for automated classification of medical images into a predefined group. The process comprises a series of consecutive steps including image acquisition and pre-processing, segmentation of the desired region of interest, calculation of defined features, feature engineering, and construction of the classification model. The features calculated in this process are mainly shape features, as well as first- and higher-order texture features. To date, more than 100 features have been defined, although this number varies depending on the application. The greatest challenge in radiomics is building a cross-validated model based on a selected set of calculated features known as the radiomic signature. Numerous radiomic signatures have successfully been developed; however, reproducibility and clinical validity of the results obtained constitutes a considerable challenge of modern radiomics. Deep learning algorithms are another rapidly evolving technique and are recognized as a valuable tool in the field of medical image analysis for the detection, characterization, and assessment of lesions. Such an approach involves the design of artificial neural network architecture while upholding the goal of high classification accuracy. This paper illuminates the evolution and current state of artificial intelligence methods in lung imaging and the detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules, with a particular emphasis on radiomics and deep learning methods.","F.

10.1093/jbi/wbab014,,,Radiomics: A Primer for Breast Radiologists,"Abstract Radiomics has a long-standing history in breast imaging with computer-aided detection (CAD) for screening mammography developed in the late 20th century. Although conventional CAD had widespread adoption, the clinical benefits for experienced breast radiologists were debatable due to high false-positive marks and subsequent increased recall rates. The dramatic growth in recent years of artificial intelligence–based analysis, including machine learning and deep learning, has provided numerous opportunities for improved modern radiomics work in breast imaging. There has been extensive radiomics work in mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis, MRI, ultrasound, PET-CT, and combined multimodality imaging. Specific radiomics outcomes of interest have been diverse, including CAD, prediction of response to neoadjuvant therapy, lesion classification, and survival, among other outcomes. Additionally, the radiogenomics subfield that correlates radiomics features with genetics has been very proliferative, in parallel with the clinical validation of breast cancer molecular subtypes and gene expression assays. Despite the promise of radiomics, there are important challenges related to image normalization, limited large unbiased data sets, and lack of external validation. Much of the radiomics work to date has been exploratory using single-institution retrospective series for analysis, but several promising lines of investigation have made the leap to clinical practice with commercially available products. As a result, breast radiologists will increasingly be incorporating radiomics-based tools into their daily practice in the near future. Therefore, breast radiologists must have a broad understanding of the scope, applications, and limitations of radiomics work.","Lars J. Grimm,Lars J. Grimm",Journal of Biogeography,2021.0

PURPOSE To investigate the sensitivity of myocardial radiomic features to changes in imaging parameters in cardiac MR images. STUDY TYPE Prospective. POPULATION A total of 11 healthy participants/five patients. FIELD STRENGTH/ SEQUENCE A 3T/cine balanced steady-state free-precession, T1 -weighted spoiled gradient-echo, T2 -weighted turbo spin-echo, and quantitative T1 and T2 mapping. For each sequence, the flip angle, in-plane resolution, slice thickness, and parallel imaging technique were varied to study the sensitivity of radiomic features to alterations in imaging parameters. ASSESSMENT Myocardial contours were manually delineated by experienced readers, and a total of 1023 radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics with 11 image filters and six feature families. STATISTICAL TESTS Sensitivity was defined as the standardized mean difference (D effect size), and the robust features were defined at sensitivity<0.2. Sensitivity analysis was performed on predefined sets of reproducible features. The analysis was performed using the entire cohort of 16 subejcts. RESULTS 64% of radiomic features were robust (sensitivity<0.2) to changes in any imaging parameter. In qualitative sequences, radiomic features were most sensitive to changes in in-plane spatial resolution (spatial resolution: 0.6 vs. flip angle: 0.19, parallel imaging: 0.18, slice thickness: 0.07; P<0.01 for all); in quantitative sequences, radiomic features were least sensitive to changes in spatial resolution (spatial resolution: 0.07 vs. slice thickness: 0.16, flip angle: 0.24; P<0.01 for all). In an individual feature level, no singular feature family/image filter was identified as robust (sensitivity<0.2) across sequences; however, highly sensitive features were predominantly associated with high-frequency wavelet filters across all sequences (32/50 features).

10.3390/cancers13081848,,,The Effects of In-Plane Spatial Resolution on CT-Based Radiomic Features' Stability with and without ComBat Harmonization.,"While handcrafted radiomic features (HRFs) have shown promise in the field of personalized medicine, many hurdles hinder its incorporation into clinical practice, including but not limited to their sensitivity to differences in acquisition and reconstruction parameters. In this study, we evaluated the effects of differences in in-plane spatial resolution (IPR) on HRFs, using a phantom dataset (n = 14) acquired on two scanner models. Furthermore, we assessed the effects of interpolation methods (IMs), the choice of a new unified in-plane resolution (NUIR), and ComBat harmonization on the reproducibility of HRFs. The reproducibility of HRFs was significantly affected by variations in IPR, with pairwise concordant HRFs, as measured by the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), ranging from 42% to 95%. The number of concordant HRFs (CCC > 0.9) after resampling varied depending on (i) the scanner model, (ii) the IM, and (iii) the NUIR. The number of concordant HRFs after ComBat harmonization depended on the variations between the batches harmonized. The majority of IMs resulted in a higher number of concordant HRFs compared to ComBat harmonization, and the combination of IMs and ComBat harmonization did not yield a significant benefit. Our developed framework can be used to assess the reproducibility and harmonizability of RFs.","Abdalla Ibrahim,Abdalla Ibrahim,Sergey Primakov,Bruno Barufaldi,Sergey Primakov,Raymond J.

Methods 140 patients with pathologically confirm edrectal cancer were included in the study. They underwent baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between April 2015 and May 2018 before receiving any treatment. According to the results of liver biopsy, surgical pathology, and imaging, patients were put into two groups, the patients with hepatic metastasis and those without. T2 weighted images (T2WI), diffusion weighted images (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images were used to draw the region of interest (ROI) of primary lesions on consecutive slices on ITK-SNAP. 3-D ROIs were generated and loaded into Artificial Intelligent Kit for extraction of radiomics features and 396 features were extracted for each sequence. The feature data were preprocessed on Python and the samples were oversampled, using Support Vector Machine-Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SVM-SMOTE) to balance the number of samples in the group with liver metastasis and the group with no liver metastasis at the end of the follow-up. Then, the samples were divided into the training cohort and the test cohort at a ratio of 2∶1. The logistic regression models were developed with selected radionomic features on R software. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and calibration curves were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Results In total, 52 patients with liver metastasis and 88 patients without liver metastasis at the end of follow-up were enrolled. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and T stage and N stage evaluated on the MRI images showed statistically significant difference between the two groups ( P<0.05). After data preprocessing and selecting, except for 17 non-radiomic features, the model combining T2WI, DWI and ADC features, the model of T2WI features alone, the model of DWI features alone and the model of ADC features alone were developed with 32 features, 10 features, 30 features and 15 features, respectively. The combined model (T2WI+DWI+ADC), the T2WI model, and the ADC model can assess hepatic metastasis accurately, with the area under curve ( AUC) on the train set reaching 93.5%, 89.2%, 90.6% and that of the test set reaching 80.8%, 80.5%, 81.4%, respectively. The combined model did not show a higher AUC than those of the T2WI and ADC alone models. Model based on DWI features has a slightly insufficient AUC of 90.3% in the train set and 75.1% in the test set. The calibration curve showed the smallest fluctuation in the combined model, which is closest fit to the diagonal reference line. The fluctuation in the three independent data set models were similar. The calibration curves of all the four models showed that as the risk increased, the prediction of the models turned from an underestimation to an overestimating the risk. In brief, the combined model showed the best performance, with the best fit to the diagonal reference line in calibration curve and high AUC comparable to the AUC of the T2WI model and ADC model. The performance of T2WI and ADC alone models were second to that of the combined model, while the DWI alone model showed relatively poor performance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Catphan® 504 was imaged using the default IGRT OBI CBCT imaging protocols and CT scanner. Seven known density image regions of the phantom were segmented and image feature was extracted by Imaging Biomarker Explorer (IBEX) software. The 49 selected features from four feature categories were analyzed by considering each region of interest (ROI) segment as individual image set. Correlation was studies using interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS The ICC of the three feature categories, namely intensity, GLCM, and GLRLM was significant (p-value<0.05) in comparison with CT, while the ICC of the fourth feature category, NID, was no significant. The average absolute Pearson's correlation coefficient from the features of the images was as follows: CT: r=0.679±0.257, CBCThead: r=0.707±0.231, CBCTthorax: r=0.643±0.260, and CBCTpelvis: r=0.594±0.276. CONCLUSION  It seems that the various densities of Catphan® 504 ROI image segments of the CT radiomics are reproducible with CBCT radiomics and CBCT radiomics can be used as an independent modality.","Dharmendran Palani,Dharmendran Palani,Senthilkumar Shanmugam,Senthilkumar Shanmugam,Kesavan Govindaraj,Kesavan Govindaraj",Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention,2021.0
10.3389/fnagi.2021.632138,,,Artificial Intelligence Can Effectively Predict Early Hematoma Expansion of Intracerebral Hemorrhage Analyzing Noncontrast Computed Tomography Image.,"Significant early hematoma expansion in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage is an independent predictor of poor functional outcomes. Therefore, the identification of the possible enlargement of hematoma and prescription of treatment in accordance would facilitate the improvement of the prognosis of patients. Studies have demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity via computed tomographic angiography for predicting hematoma enlargement. However, the conditions of most of the patients do not allow complete examination in time. On the other hand, the use of non-contrast computed tomography is more convenient and popular in clinical settings. The signs of non-contrast computed tomography indicating hematoma enlargement needs to be recognized by doctors manually, as the outcome has high specificity, but low sensitivity. Therefore, it is extremely significant to predict hematoma enlargement more rapidly and accurately by using non-contrast computed tomography imaging. Considering these, we conducted a study to research whether hematoma enlargement can be predicted with non-contrast computed tomography images based on artificial intelligence. A total of 1899 non-contrast computed tomography images of cerebral hemorrhage patients were retrospectively analyzed to establish a predicting model, and 1117 to validate the model. And a total of 118 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criterions so as to validate the value of the model for clinical prediction. The baseline non-contrast computed tomography images within 6 h of intracerebral hemorrhage onset, and the second non-contrast computed tomography performed at 24 ± 3 h from the onset were used to evaluate the prediction of intracerebral hemorrhage growth. In the validation dataset 1, AUC was 0.778 (95% CI, 0.768-0.786), sensitivity was 0.818 (95% CI, 0.790-0.843), and specificity was 0.601 (95% CI, 0.565-0.632). In the validation dataset 2, AUC was 0.780 (95% CI, 0.761-0.798), sensitivity was 0.732 (95% CI, 0.682-0.788), and specificity was 0.709 (95% CI, 0.658-0.759). The sensitivity of intracerebral hemorrhage hematoma expansion as predicted by artificial intelligence imaging system was 89.3%, with the specificity of 77.8%, positive predictive value of 55.6%, negative predictive value of 95.9%, and a Yoden index of 0.671, which were much higher than those based on the manually labeled non-contrast computed tomography signs.","Linyang Teng,Qianwei Ren,Linyang Teng,Pingye Zhang,Qianwei Ren,Zhenzhou Wu,Pingye Zhang,Zhenzhou Wu,Wei Guo,Tianhua Ren,Wei Guo,Tianhua Ren",Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,2021.0
10.3748/wjg.v27.i16.1664,,,Artificial intelligence in gastroenterology and hepatology: Status and challenges.,"Originally proposed by John McCarthy in 1955, artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved a breakthrough and revolutionized the processing methods of clinical medicine with the increasing workloads of medical records and digital images. Doctors are paying attention to AI technologies for various diseases in the fields of gastroenterology and hepatology. This review will illustrate AI technology procedures for medical image analysis, including data processing, model establishment, and model validation. Furthermore, we will summarize AI applications in endoscopy, radiology, and pathology, such as detecting and evaluating lesions, facilitating treatment, and predicting treatment response and prognosis with excellent model performance. The current challenges for AI in clinical application include potential inherent bias in retrospective studies that requires larger samples for validation, ethics and legal concerns, and the incomprehensibility of the output results. Therefore, doctors and researchers should cooperate to address the current challenges and carry out further investigations to develop more accurate AI tools for improved clinical applications.","Jiasheng Cao,Ziyi Lu,Jiasheng Cao,Mingyu Chen,Zi-Yi Lu,Bin Zhang,Mingyu Chen,Sarun Juengpanich,Bin Zhang,Bin Zhang,Sarun Juengpanich,Jiahao Hu,Sarun Juengpanich,Shijie Li,Jiahao Hu,Win Topatana,Shijie Li,Win Topatana,Xue-Yin Zhou,Xue-Yin Zhou,Feng Xu,Jiliang Shen,Xu Feng,Yu Liu,Jiliang Shen,Yu Liu,Xiujun Cai,Xiujun Cai",World Journal of Gastroenterology,2021.0

Nonstandard techniques can cause undesirable variability that impedes result reproducibility and limits clinical utility. Objective: The purpose of this study is to measure agreement of texture metrics extracted by 6 software packages. Methods: This retrospective study included 40 renal cell carcinomas with contrast-enhanced CT from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Imaging Archive. Images were analyzed by 7 readers at 6 sites. Each reader used 1 of 6 software packages to extract commonly studied texture features. Inter and intra-reader agreement for segmentation was assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients. First-order (available in 6 packages) and second-order (available in 3 packages) texture features were compared between software pairs using Pearson correlation. Results: Inter- and intra-reader agreement was excellent (ICC 0.93-1). First-order feature correlations were strong (r>0.8, p<0.001) between 75% (21/28) of software pairs for mean and standard deviation, 48% (10/21) for entropy, 29% (8/28) for skewness, and 25% (7/28) for kurtosis. Of 15 second-order features, only co-occurrence matrix correlation, grey-level non-uniformity, and run-length non-uniformity showed strong correlation between software packages (0.90-1, p<0.001). Conclusion: Variability in first and second order texture features was common across software configurations and produced inconsistent results. Standardized algorithms and reporting methods are needed before texture data can be reliably used for clinical applications. Clinical Impact: It is important to be aware of variability related to texture software processing and configuration when reporting and comparing outputs.","Ankur M. Doshi,Ankur M.

10.1186/s12967-021-02818-1,33902640.0,,Automatic identification of myopic maculopathy related imaging features in optic disc region via machine learning methods.,"Background  Myopic maculopathy (MM) is the most serious and irreversible complication of pathologic myopia, which is a major cause of visual impairment and blindness. Clinic proposed limited number of factors related to MM. To explore additional features strongly related with MM from optic disc region, we employ a machine learning based radiomics analysis method, which could explore and quantify more hidden or imperceptible MM-related features to the naked eyes and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of MM and therefore may assist to distinguish the high-risk population in an early stage.  Methods  A total of 457 eyes (313 patients) were enrolled and were divided into severe MM group and without severe MM group. Radiomics analysis was applied to depict features significantly correlated with severe MM from optic disc region. Receiver Operating Characteristic were used to evaluate these features' performance of classifying severe MM.  Results  Eight new MM-related image features were discovered from the optic disc region, which described the shapes, textural patterns and intensity distributions of optic disc region. Compared with clinically reported MM-related features, these newly discovered features exhibited better abilities on severe MM classification. And the mean values of most features were markedly changed between patients with peripapillary diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (PDCA) and macular diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (MDCA).  Conclusions  Machine learning and radiomics method are useful tools for mining more MM-related features from the optic disc region, by which complex or even hidden MM-related features can be discovered and decoded. In this paper, eight new MM-related image features were found, which would be useful for further quantitative study of MM-progression. As a nontrivial byproduct, marked changes between PDCA and MDCA was discovered by both new image features and clinic features.","Yuchen Du,Qiuying Chen,Yuchen Du,Ying Fan,Qiuying Chen,Ying Fan,Jianfeng Zhu,Jianfeng Zhu,Jiangnan He,Haidong Zou,Jiangnan He,Haidong Zou,Dazhen Sun,Dazhen Sun,Bowen Xin,Bowen Xin,Bowen Xin,Bowen Xin,David Dagan Feng,Michael Fulham,David Dagan Feng,Xiuying Wang,Michael J.

10.1186/s13244-021-01008-3,34076740.0,,CT and MRI radiomics of bone and soft-tissue sarcomas: a systematic review of reproducibility and validation strategies,"BACKGROUND Feature reproducibility and model validation are two main challenges of radiomics. This study aims to systematically review radiomic feature reproducibility and predictive model validation strategies in studies dealing with CT and MRI radiomics of bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. The ultimate goal is to promote achieving a consensus on these aspects in radiomic workflows and facilitate clinical transferability. RESULTS Out of 278 identified papers, forty-nine papers published between 2008 and 2020 were included. They dealt with radiomics of bone (n=12) or soft-tissue (n=37) tumors. Eighteen (37%) studies included a feature reproducibility analysis. Inter-/intra-reader segmentation variability was the theme of reproducibility analysis in 16 (33%) investigations, outnumbering the analyses focused on image acquisition or post-processing (n=2, 4%). The intraclass correlation coefficient was the most commonly used statistical method to assess reproducibility, which ranged from 0.6 and 0.9. At least one machine learning validation technique was used for model development in 25 (51%) papers, and K-fold cross-validation was the most commonly employed. A clinical validation of the model was reported in 19 (39%) papers. It was performed using a separate dataset from the primary institution (i.e., internal validation) in 14 (29%) studies and an independent dataset related to different scanners or from another institution (i.e., independent validation) in 5 (10%) studies. CONCLUSIONS The issues of radiomic feature reproducibility and model validation varied largely among the studies dealing with musculoskeletal sarcomas and should be addressed in future investigations to bring the field of radiomics from a preclinical research area to the clinical stage.","Salvatore Gitto,Salvatore Gitto,Renato Cuocolo,Renato Cuocolo,Domenico Albano,Domenico Albano,Francesco Morelli,Lorenzo Pescatori,Francesco Morelli,Carmelo Messina,Lorenzo Carlo Pescatori,Carmelo Messina,Massimo Imbriaco,Massimo Imbriaco,Luca Maria Sconfienza,Luca Maria Sconfienza",Insights Into Imaging,2021.0
10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103407,34051442.0,,CT radiomics-based machine learning classification of atypical cartilaginous tumours and appendicular chondrosarcomas.,"Abstract   Background  Clinical management ranges from surveillance or curettage to wide resection for atypical to higher-grade cartilaginous tumours, respectively. Our aim was to investigate the performance of computed tomography (CT) radiomics-based machine learning for classification of atypical cartilaginous tumours and higher-grade chondrosarcomas of long bones.    Methods  One-hundred-twenty patients with histology-proven lesions were retrospectively included. The training cohort consisted of 84 CT scans from centre 1 (n=55 G1 or atypical cartilaginous tumours; n=29 G2-G4 chondrosarcomas). The external test cohort consisted of the CT component of 36 positron emission tomography-CT scans from centre 2 (n=16 G1 or atypical cartilaginous tumours; n=20 G2-G4 chondrosarcomas). Bidimensional segmentation was performed on preoperative CT. Radiomic features were extracted. After dimensionality reduction and class balancing in centre 1, the performance of a machine-learning classifier (LogitBoost) was assessed on the training cohort using 10-fold cross-validation and on the external test cohort. In centre 2, its performance was compared with preoperative biopsy and an experienced radiologist using McNemar's test.    Findings  The classifier had 81% (AUC=0.89) and 75% (AUC=0.78) accuracy in identifying the lesions in the training and external test cohorts, respectively. Specifically, its accuracy in classifying atypical cartilaginous tumours and higher-grade chondrosarcomas was 84% and 78% in the training cohort, and 81% and 70% in the external test cohort, respectively. Preoperative biopsy had 64% (AUC=0.66) accuracy (p=0.29). The radiologist had 81% accuracy (p=0.75).

METHODS Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who underwent longitudinal chest CT between January 01 and February 18, 2020 were included. A total of 1316 radiomic features were extracted from the lung parenchyma window for each CT. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Relief, Las Vegas Wrapper (LVW), L1-norm-Support Vector Machine (L1-norm-SVM), and recursive feature elimination (RFE) were applied to select the features that associated with rapid progression. Four machine learning classifiers were used for modeling, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Decision Tree (DT). Accordingly, 20 radiomic models were developed on the basis of 296 CT scans and validated in 74 CT scans. Model performance was determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS A total of 107 patients (median age, 49.0 years, interquartile range, 35-54) were evaluated. The patients underwent a total of 370 chest CT scans with a median interval of 4 days (interquartile range, 3-5 days). The combination methods of L1-norm SVM and SVM with 17 radiomic features yielded the highest performance in predicting the likelihood of rapid progression of pneumonia lesions on next CT scan, with an AUC of 0.857 (95% CI: 0.766-0.947), sensitivity of 87.5%, and specificity of 70.7%. CONCLUSIONS Our radiomic model based on longitudinal chest CT data could predict the rapid progression of pneumonia lesions, which may facilitate the CT follow-up intervals and reduce the radiation. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE Radiomic features extracted from the current chest CT have potential in predicting the likelihood of rapid progression of pneumonia lesions on the next chest CT, which would improve clinical decision-making regarding timely treatment.","Bin Zhang,Bin Zhang,Bin Zhang,Mayidili Nijiati,Ruike Yan,Ma-Yi-di-Li Ni-Jia-Ti,Nan An,Ruike Yan,Nan An,Chen Lv,Lv Chen,Shuyi Liu,Luyan Chen,Shuyi Liu,Luyan Chen,Justin Chen,Minmin Li,Qiuying Chen,Zhuozhi Chen,Minmin Li,Zhuozhi Chen,Jungmok You,Yang Dong,Jingjing You,Yuhao Dong,Yuhao Dong,Yuhao Dong,Zhiyuan Xiong,Shuixing Zhang,Zhiyuan Xiong,Zhiyuan Xiong,Shuixing Zhang",British Journal of Radiology,2021.0

We collected 643 H&E-stained BCa images from Shanghai General Hospital and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We constructed and cross-verified automatic diagnosis and prognosis models by performing a machine learning algorithm based on pathomics data. Our study indicated that high diagnostic efficiency of the machine learning-based diagnosis model was observed in patients with BCa, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 96.3%, 89.2%, and 94.1% in the training cohort, test cohort, and external validation cohort, respectively. Our diagnosis model also performed well in distinguishing patients with BCa from patients with glandular cystitis, with an AUC value of 93.4% in the General cohort. Significant differences were found in overall survival in TCGA cohort (hazard ratio (HR)=2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.56-2.81, P<.0001) and the General cohort (HR=5.32, 95% CI: 2.95-9.59, P<.0001) comparing patients with BCa of high risk vs low risk stratified by risk score, which was proved to be an independent prognostic factor for BCa. The integration nomogram based on our risk score and clinicopathologic characters displayed higher prediction accuracy than current tumor stage/grade systems, with AUC values of 77.7%, 83.8%, and 81.3% for 1-, 3-, and 5-y overall survival prediction of patients with BCa.

The secondary purpose was to search for any other variables associated with FPE.  Materials and methods  Patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for anterior circulation large vessel stroke in a single center were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: FPE and non-FPE. Two observers extracted RFs from the clot on pretreatment noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) images. Demographic, clinical, periprocedural, and RFs were compared between the groups and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent predictors of FPE.  Results  Fifty-two patients (27 female, 25 male; mean age 64.50 ± 15.15) who were treated by stent retrievers as the first option were included in the study. FPE was achieved in 25 patients (25/52, 48.1%). Twelve RFs were significantly different between patients with FPE and non-FPE. The long-run low gray-level emphasis (odds ratio = 44.24, p = 0.003) and the zone percentage (odds ratio = 16.88, p = 0.017) were found as independent predictors of FPE. Female sex and a baseline ASPECT score of >8.5 were the other independent variables to predict FPE. The diagnostic accuracy to predict FPE was observed as 83% when using all independent predictors in our predictive model.  Conclusions  Clot-based RFs on NCCT may help to estimate the success of the intended outcome of MT in patients with AIS.","Orkun Sarıoğlu,Orkun Sarioglu,Fatma Ceren Sarıoğlu,Fatma Ceren Sarioglu,Fatma Ceren Sarıoğlu,Ahmet Ergin Çapar,Demet Fb Sokmez,Ahmet Ergin Capar,Berna Dirim Mete,Demet Fb Sokmez,Ümit Belet,Ümit Belet,Berna Dirim Mete,Umit Belet",Interventional Neuroradiology,2021.0

We aimed to develop a computed tomography–based radiomic model and validate its usefulness in the prediction of normal-sized LNM at node level in cervical cancer.    Methods  A total of 273 LNs of 219 patients from 10 centers were evaluated in this study. We randomly divided the LNs from the 2 centers with the largest number of LNs into the training and internal validation cohorts, and the rest as the external validation cohort. Radiomic features were extracted from the arterial and venous phase images. We trained an artificial neural network (ANN) to develop two single-phase models. A radiomic model reflecting the features of two-phase images was also built for directly predicting LNM in cervical cancer. Moreover, four state-of-the-art methods were used for comparison. The performance of all models was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).    Results  Among the models we built, the models combining the features of two phases surpassed the single-phase models, and the models generated by ANN had better performance than the others. We found that the radiomic model achieved the highest AUCs of 0.912 and 0.859 in the training and internal validation cohorts, respectively. In the external validation cohort, the AUC of the radiomic model was 0.800.    Conclusion  We constructed a radiomic model that exhibited great ability in the prediction of LNM.

10.1063/5.0051135,,,Determination of image features in cone beam computerized tomography used in lung stereotactic radiotherapy: A phantom study,"Introduction The extraction of features from different medical images can provide information on the changes induced in tumor tissue when patients undergo radiotherapy treatments [1]. One of the imaging modalities in daily use to ensure accurate positioning in lung cancer patients undergoing stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). In this study we propose a method to extract potentially useful quantitative features from CBCT images in a phantom chest. We also analyze the degree of repeatability and reproducibility that can be achieved in each of the features. Materials and method After the implementation of a CBCT quality control protocol [2] to the On-Board Imaging System (OBI) of a Novalis Tx (Varian Medical Systems) medical linear accelerator at the American British Cowdray Medical Center in the City of Mexico, CBCT images of a phantom of the thorax were acquired with different inserts made of thermoplastic material. Using open access software, 2D and 3D shape features, features based on a statistic of first order and texture features (features based on a statistic of second order) were extracted. Results and discussion From the analyzed CBCT images, a total of 107 features were extracted. The methodology was selected according to semi-automatic segmentation procedures to reduce user-dependent results, starting with threshold Hounsfield unit values in a window range for lung tissue. The degree of reproducibility and repeatability of the extracted features and the possible viability of CBCT images for possible radiomics studies in patients with lung cancer and undergoing radiosurgery are analyzed. Conclusions This work describes a methodology for the extraction of reproducible and repeatable features in CBCT images that can potentially be used to asses lung radiotherapy treatment effect in tumor tissue when the methodology is extrapolated to real images of patients. However, the prognostic value of the reported characteristics should be investigated in further studies.","David Valdes-Corona,David Valdes-Corona,Mariana Hernández-Bojórquez,Alberto E.

This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for preoperative prediction of LN metastasis in LUAD based on a radiomics signature and deep learning signature. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included a training cohort of 200 patients, an internal validation cohort of 40 patients, and an external validation cohort of 60 patients. Radiomics features were extracted from conventional computed tomography (CT) images. T-test and extra-trees were performed for feature selection, and the selected features were combined using logistic regression to build the radiomics signature. The features and weights of the last fully connected layer of a convolutional neural network (CNN) were combined to obtain a deep learning signature. By incorporating clinical risk factors, the prediction model was developed using a multivariable logistic regression analysis, based on which the nomogram was developed. The calibration, discrimination and clinical values of the nomogram were evaluated. Results: Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the radiomics signature, deep learning signature, and CT-reported LN status were independent predictors. The prediction model developed by all the independent predictors showed good discrimination (C-index, 0.820; 95% CI, 0.762 to 0.879) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, p=0.193) capabilities for the training cohort. Additionally, the model achieved satisfactory discrimination (C-index, 0.861; 95% CI, 0.769 to 0.954) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, p=0.775) when applied to the external validation cohort. An analysis of the decision curve showed that the nomogram had potential for clinical application. Conclusions: This study presents a prediction model using a radiomics signature, deep learning signature, and CT-reported LN status, that can be used to predict preoperative LN metastasis in patients with LUAD.","Ru Jia,Jia Ran,R.

We aim to develop and evaluate CT-based radiomics signature to preoperatively predict invasive behavior in pSPN. Methods Eighty-five patients who had pathologically confirmed pSPN and preoperative contrasted-enhanced CT imaging in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed (invasive: 24; non-invasive: 61). 1316 radiomics features were separately extracted from delineated 2D or 3D ROIs in arterial and venous phases. 200% (SMOTE) was used to generate balanced dataset (invasive: 72, non-invasive: 96) for each phase, which was for feature selection and modeling. The model was internally validated in the original dataset. Inter-observer consistency analysis, spearman correlation, univariate analysis, LASSO regression and backward stepwise logical regression were mainly applied to screen the features, and 6 logistic regression models were established based on multi-phase features from 2D or 3D segmentations. The ROC analysis and Delong’s test were mainly used for model assessment and AUC comparison. Results It retained 11，8，7 and 7 features to construct 3D-arterial, 3D-venous, 2D-arterial and 2D-venous model. Based on 3D ROIs, the arterial model (AUC: 0.914) performed better than venous (AUC: 0.815) and the arterial-venous combined model was slightly improved (AUC: 0.918). Based on 2D ROIs, the arterial model (AUC: 0.814) performed better than venous (AUC:0.768), while the arterial-venous combined model (AUC:0.893) performed better than any single-phase model. In addition, the 3D arterial model performed better than the best combined 2D model. The Delong’s test showed that the significant difference of model AUC existed in arterial models in original dataset (p = 0.019) while not in arterial-venous combined model (p=0.49) as comparing 2D and 3D ROIs. Conclusion The arterial radiomics model constructed by 3D-ROI feature is potential to predict the invasiveness of pSPN preoperatively.","Wei Huang,Si-Yun Liu,Wenpeng Huang,Si-yun Liu,Yijing Han,Yi-jing Han,Liming Li,Pan Liang,Li-ming Li,Pan Liang,Jianbo Gao,Jianbo Gao",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0
10.1007/978-3-030-65245-6_17,,,Fundamentals of Radiomics in Nuclear Medicine and Hybrid Imaging,"Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) are nuclear diagnostic imaging modalities for different diseases including cardiac failures and cancer. They hold the advantage of detecting disease-related biochemical and physiologic abnormalities in advance of anatomical changes, thus widely used for staging of disease progression, identification of the treatment gross tumor volume, monitoring of disease, as well as prediction of outcomes and personalization of treatment regimens. Among the arsenal of different functional imaging modalities, nuclear imaging has benefited from early adoption of quantitative image analysis starting from simple standard uptake value (SUV) normalization to more advanced extraction of complex imaging uptake patterns; thanks chiefly to application of sophisticated image processing and machine learning algorithms. In this chapter, we discuss the application of image processing and machine/deep learning techniques to PET/SPECT imaging with special focus on the oncological radiotherapy domain as a case study. We will start from basic feature extraction to application in image-based outcome modeling in the radiomics and the deep learning fields.","Lin-Hung Wei,Issam El Naqa,Lise Wei,Issam El Naqa,Issam El Naqa",,2021.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS One-hundred-and-fifty-four patients were enrolled (74 individuals with SCCs and 80 with lymphomas). After feature analysis and feature selection with variance threshold and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods, an MRI-based radiomics model with the support vector machine (SVM) classifier was constructed in differentiation between lymphomas and SCCs. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the MRI-based radiomics model were compared with those of radiologists using Delong test. RESULTS Five features (T1 original shape Compactness2, T1 wavelet-HHH first-order Total Energy, T2 wavelet-HLH GLCM Informational Measure of Correlation1, T1 wavelet-LHL GLCM Inverse Variance and T1 square GLRLM Long Run Low Gray Level Emphasis) were finally selected in the radiomics model. The AUC values in differentiation between lymphomas and SCCs were 0.94 for the training dataset and 0.85 for the validation dataset, respectively. For all the patient datasets, the AUC values of radiomics model, readers 1, 2 and 3 were 0.92, 0.76, 0.77 and 0.80, respectively. For the validation datasets, no significant difference was found between the AUCs of the radiomics model and those of the three radiologist (P=0.459, 0.469, 0.738 for radiologist 1, 2 and 3, respectively). CONCLUSION An MRI-based radiomics model can help to differentiate sinonasal lymphomas from SCCs with high accuracy.","Xinyan Wang,Xinyan Wang,Shuangfeng Dai,Shuangfeng Dai,Qian Wang,Qian Wang,Xiaodong Chai,Xian Jian,Xiangfei Chai,Junfang Xian",Japanese Journal of Radiology,2021.0
10.3390/cancers13102447,,,MRI-Based Radiomics Analysis for the Pretreatment Prediction of Pathologic Complete Tumor Response to Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy in Breast Cancer Patients: A Multicenter Study.,"This retrospective study investigated the value of pretreatment contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based radiomics for the prediction of pathologic complete tumor response to neoadjuvant systemic therapy in breast cancer patients. A total of 292 breast cancer patients, with 320 tumors, who were treated with neo-adjuvant systemic therapy and underwent a pretreatment MRI exam were enrolled. As the data were collected in two different hospitals with five different MRI scanners and varying acquisition protocols, three different strategies to split training and validation datasets were used. Radiomics, clinical, and combined models were developed using random forest classifiers in each strategy. The analysis of radiomics features had no added value in predicting pathologic complete tumor response to neoadjuvant systemic therapy in breast cancer patients compared with the clinical models, nor did the combined models perform significantly better than the clinical models. Further, the radiomics features selected for the models and their performance differed with and within the different strategies. Due to previous and current work, we tentatively attribute the lack of improvement in clinical models following the addition of radiomics to the effects of variations in acquisition and reconstruction parameters. The lack of reproducibility data (i.e., test-retest or similar) meant that this effect could not be analyzed. These results indicate the need for reproducibility studies to preselect reproducible features in order to properly assess the potential of radiomics.","R. Granzier,Abdalla Ibrahim,R. W. Y.

10.1259/bjr.20201212,33882240.0,,MRI-based radiomics as response predictor to radiochemotherapy for metastatic cervical lymph node in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"OBJECTIVE To establish and substantiate MRI-based radiomic models to predict the treatment response of metastatic cervical lymph node to radiochemotherapy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS A total of 145 consecutive patients with NPC were enrolled including 102 in primary cohort and 43 in validation cohort. Metastatic lymph nodes were diagnosed according to radiologic criteria and treatment response was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. A total of 2704 radiomic features were extracted from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) for each patient, and were selected to construct radiomic signatures for CE-T1WI, T2WI, and combined CE-T1WI and T2WI, respectively. The area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were used to estimate the performance of these radiomic models in predicting treatment response of metastatic lymph node. RESULTS No significant difference of AUC was found among radiomic signatures of CE-T1WI, T2WI, and combined CE-T1WI and T2WI in the primary and validation cohorts (all p > 0.05). For combined CE-T1WI and T2WI dataset, 12 features were selected to develop the radiomic signature. The AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 0.927 (0.878-0.975), 0.911 (0.804-0.970), 0.826 (0.686-0.922), and 0.872 (0.792-0.930) in primary cohort, and were 0.772 (0.624-0.920), 0.792 (0.578-0.929), 0.790 (0.544-0.939), and 0.791 (0.640-0.900) in validation cohort. CONCLUSION MRI-based radiomic models were developed to predict the treatment response of metastatic cervical lymph nodes to radiochemotherapy in patients with NPC, which might facilitate individualized therapy for metastatic lymph nodes before treatment. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE Predicting the response in patients with NPC before treatment may allow more individualizing therapeutic strategy and avoid unnecessary side-effects and costs. Radiomic features extracted from metastatic cervical lymph nodes showed promising application for predicting the treatment response in NPC.","Hao Xu,Xu Hao,Jieke Liu,Ying Huang,Hao Xu,Ying Huang,Jieke Liu,Peng Zhou,Ying Huang,Jing Ren,Peng Zhou,Jing Ren",British Journal of Radiology,2021.0

Although radiographic pneumatosis intestinalis is relatively common, there is no validated clinical tool to guide surgical management.    Methods  Using a retrospective cohort of 300 pneumatosis intestinalis cases from a single institution, we developed 3 machine learning models for 2 clinical tasks: (1) the distinction of benign from pathologic pneumatosis intestinalis cases and (2) the determination of patients who would benefit from an operation. The 3 models are (1) an imaging model based on radiomic features extracted from computed tomography scans, (2) a clinical model based on clinical variables, and (3) a combination model using both the imaging and clinical variables.    Results  The combination model achieves an area under the curve of 0.91 (confidence interval: 0.87–0.94) for task I and an area under the curve of 0.84 (confidence interval: 0.79–0.88) for task II.

Purpose  To construct and cross-validate a machine learning model based on radiomics features from T2 -weighted imaging (T2 WI) of PI-RADS 3 lesions to identify clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), that is, pathological Grade Group ≥ 2.  Study type  Single-center retrospective study.  Population  A total of 240 patients were included (training cohort, n = 188, age range 43-82 years; test cohort, n = 52, age range 41-79 years). Eligibility criteria were 1) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsy between 2015 and 2020; 2) PI-RADS 3 index lesion identified on multiparametric MRI; (3) biopsy performed within 1 year of MRI. The percentages of csPCa lesions were 10.6% and 15.4% in the training and test cohorts, respectively.  Field strength/sequence  A 3 T; T2 WI turbo-spin echo, diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo planar imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with time-resolved T1-weighted imaging.  Assessment  Multislice volumes-of-interest (VOIs) were drawn in the PI-RADS 3 index lesions on T2 WI. A total of 107 radiomics features (first-order histogram and second-order texture) were extracted from the segmented lesions.  Statistical tests  A random forest classifier using the radiomics features as input was trained and validated for prediction of csPCa. The performance of the machine learning classifier, prostate specific antigen (PSA) density, and prostate volume for csPCa prediction was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.  Results  The trained random forest classifier constructed from the T2 WI radiomics features good and statistically significant area-under-the-curves (AUCs) of 0.76 (P = 0.022) for prediction of csPCa in the test set. Prostate volume and PSA density showed moderate and nonsignificant performance (AUC 0.62, P = 0.275 and 0.61, P = 0.348, respectively) for csPCa prediction in the test set.

10.1007/s00330-021-07902-0,33864139.0,,Noninvasive prediction of residual disease for advanced high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma by MRI-based radiomic-clinical nomogram,"OBJECTIVES To develop a preoperative MRI-based radiomic-clinical nomogram for prediction of residual disease (RD) in patients with advanced high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). METHODS In total, 217 patients with advanced HGSOC were enrolled from January 2014 to June 2019 and randomly divided into a training set (n = 160) and a validation set (n = 57). Finally, 841 radiomic features were extracted from each tumor on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI) sequence, respectively. We used two fusion methods, the maximal volume of interest (MV) and the maximal feature value (MF), to fuse the radiomic features of bilateral tumors, so that patients with bilateral tumors have the same kind of radiomic features as patients with unilateral tumors. The radiomic signatures were constructed by using mRMR method and LASSO classifier. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to develop a radiomic-clinical nomogram incorporating radiomic signature and conventional clinico-radiological features. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated on the validation set. RESULTS In total, 342 tumors from 217 patients were analyzed in this study. The MF-based radiomic signature showed significantly better prediction performance than the MV-based radiomic signature (AUC = 0.744 vs. 0.650, p = 0.047). By incorporating clinico-radiological features and MF-based radiomic signature, radiomic-clinical nomogram showed favorable prediction ability with an AUC of 0.803 in the validation set, which was significantly higher than that of clinico-radiological signature and MF-based radiomic signature (AUC = 0.623, 0.744, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The proposed MRI-based radiomic-clinical nomogram provides a promising way to noninvasively predict the RD status. KEY POINTS • MRI-based radiomic-clinical nomogram is feasible to noninvasively predict residual disease in patients with advanced HGSOC. • The radiomic signature based on MF showed significantly better prediction performance than that based on MV. • The radiomic-clinical nomogram showed a favorable prediction ability with an AUC of 0.803.","Haiming Li,Rui Zhang,Hai-Ming Li,Rui Zhang,Rui Zhang,Ruimin Li,Rui Zhang,Wei Xia,Ruimin Li,Wei Xia,Xiaojun Chen,Xiaojun Chen,Jiayi Zhang,Songqi Cai,Jiayi Zhang,Songqi Cai,Yong'ai Li,Songqi Cai,Shufang Zhao,Yongai Li,Shu-Hui Zhao,Jin Wei Qiang,Jin Wei Qiang,Weijun Peng,Jinwei Qiang,Yajia Gu,Weijun Peng,Xin Gao,Yajia Gu,Yajia Gu,Xin Gao,Xin Gao",European Radiology,2021.0

The model was developed using a training cohort (N=626) and validated with an independent testing cohort (N=270). Radiomics features and clinical predictors were selected using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and multivariate analysis. The radiomics score (Rad-score) was calculated through linear combination of selected features multiplied by their respective LASSO coefficients. The support vector machine (SVM) method was used to construct the model. IVH growth was experienced by 13.4% and 13.7% of patients in the training and testing cohorts, respectively. The Rad-score was associated with severe IVH and poor outcome. Independent predictors of IVH growth included hypercholesterolemia (odds ratio [OR], 0.12 [95%CI, 0.02-0.90]; p=0.039), baseline Graeb score (OR, 1.26 [95%CI, 1.16-1.36]; p<0.001), time to initial CT (OR, 0.70 [95%CI, 0.58-0.86]; p<0.001), international normalized ratio (OR, 4.27 [95%CI, 1.40, 13.0]; p=0.011), and Rad-score (OR, 2.3 [95%CI, 1.6-3.3]; p<0.001). In the training cohort, the model achieved an AUC of 0.78, sensitivity of 0.83, and specificity of 0.66. In the testing cohort, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.71, 0.81, and 0.64, respectively.

Materials and methods  Eighty-two patients with 127 CRLM were included. Radiomics features (with different filters) were extracted from the AZ and a 10mm periablational rim (PAR)on portal-venous-phase CT up to 8 weeks after ablation. Multivariable stepwise Cox regression analyses were used to predict LTP based on clinical and radiomics features. Performance (concordance [c]-statistics) of the different models was compared and performance in an ‘independent’ dataset was approximated with bootstrapped leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV).    Results  Thirty-three lesions (26 %) developed LTP. Median follow-up was 21 months (range 6−115).

Methods: From January 2012 to June 2018, 402 patients with pathology-confirmed lung adenocarcinoma who had two or more thin-layer CT follow-up images were retrospectively analyzed, involving 407 nodules. Two complete preoperative CT images and complete clinical data were evaluated. Training and validation sets were randomly assigned according to an 8:2 ratio. All cases were divided into fast-growing and slow-growing groups. Researchers extracted 1218 radiomics features from each region of interest (ROI). Then, radiomics features were selected by repeatability analysis and AVONA; Based on the Univariate and multivariate analyses, the significant radiographic features is selected in training set. A decision tree algorithm was conducted to establish the radiographic model, radiomics model and the combined radiographic-radiomics model. Model performance was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) obtained by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: Sixty-two radiomics features and one radiographic features were selected for predicting the growth rate of pulmonary nodules. The combined radiographic-radiomics model (AUC 0.78) performed better than the radiographic model (0.727) and the radiomics model (0.710) in the validation set.

We aim to predict PNI status in rectal cancer using multi-modality radiomics. In total, 396 radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted images (T2WIs), diffusion-weighted images (DWIs), and portal venous phase of contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT) respectively of 94 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed rectal cancer. T2WI score, DWI score, and CT score were calculated via the radiomics features selection and optimization. Discrimination, calibration, and clinical benefit ability were used to evaluate the performance of the radiomics scores in both training and testing datasets. CT score and T2WI score were independent risk predictors [CT score, OR (95% CI) = 4.218 (1.070-16.620); T2WI score, OR (95% CI) = 105.721 (3.091-3615.790)].

Random survival forests (RSF), as an accurate classifier, sort all candidate variables as the rank of importance values. There was no study concerning on finding radiomic predictors in patients with extremity and trunk wall soft-tissue sarcomas using RSF. This study aimed to determine associations between radiomic features and overall survival (OS) by RSF analysis. To identify radiomic features with important values by RSF analysis, construct predictive models for OS incorporating clinical characteristics, and evaluate models' performance with different method. We collected clinical characteristics and radiomic features extracted from plain and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) from 353 patients with extremity and trunk wall soft-tissue sarcomas treated with surgical resection. All radiomic features were analyzed by Cox proportional hazard (CPH) and followed RSF analysis. The association between radiomics-predicted risks and OS was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. All clinical features were screened by CPH analysis. Prognostic clinical and radiomic parameters were fitted into RSF and CPH integrative models for OS in the training cohort, respectively. The concordance indexes (C-index) and Brier scores of both two models were evaluated in both training and testing cohorts. The model with better predictive performance was interpreted with nomogram and calibration plots. Among all 86 radiomic features, there were three variables selected with high importance values. The RSF on these three features distinguished patients with high predicted risks from patients with low predicted risks for OS in the training set (P < 0.001) using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Age, lymph node involvement and grade were incorporated into the combined models for OS (P < 0.05). The C-indexes in both two integrative models fluctuated above 0.80 whose Brier scores maintained less than 15.0 in the training and testing datasets. The RSF model performed little advantages over the CPH model that the calibration curve of the RSF model showed favorable agreement between predicted and actual survival probabilities for the 3-year and 5-year survival prediction. The multimodality RSF model including clinical and radiomic characteristics conducted high capacity in prediction of OS which might assist individualized therapeutic regimens.

Materials and methods  Seven hundred fifty-four radiomics-based features were extracted from 1732 scans derived from the TICH-2 multicentre clinical trial. Features were harmonised and a correlation-based feature selection was applied. Different elastic-net parameterisations were tested to assess the predictive performance of the selected radiomics-based features using grid optimisation. For comparison, the same procedure was run using radiological signs and clinical factors separately. Models trained with radiomics-based features combined with radiological signs or clinical factors were tested. Predictive performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score.  Results  The optimal radiomics-based model showed an AUC of 0.693 for haematoma expansion and an AUC of 0.783 for poor functional outcome. Models with radiological signs alone yielded substantial reductions in sensitivity. Combining radiomics-based features and radiological signs did not provide any improvement over radiomics-based features alone. Models with clinical factors had similar performance compared to using radiomics-based features, albeit with low sensitivity for haematoma expansion. Performance of radiomics-based features was boosted by incorporating clinical factors, with time from onset to scan and age being the most important contributors for haematoma expansion and poor functional outcome prediction, respectively.  Conclusion  Radiomics-based features perform better than radiological signs and similarly to clinical factors on the prediction of haematoma expansion and poor functional outcome. Moreover, combining radiomics-based features with clinical factors improves their performance.  Key points  • Linear models based on CT radiomics-based features perform better than radiological signs on the prediction of haematoma expansion and poor functional outcome in the context of intracerebral haemorrhage. • Linear models based on CT radiomics-based features perform similarly to clinical factors known to be good predictors.

10.1093/cercor/bhab061,33884402.0,,Quantitative Radiomic Features as New Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease: An Amyloid PET Study.,"Growing evidence indicates that amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation is one of the most common neurobiological biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The primary aim of this study was to explore whether the radiomic features of Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) images are used as predictors and provide a neurobiological foundation for AD. The radiomics features of Aβ PET imaging of each brain region of the Brainnetome Atlas were computed for classification and prediction using a support vector machine model. The results showed that the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.93 for distinguishing AD (N=291) from normal control (NC; N=334). Additionally, the AUC was 0.83 for the prediction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) converting (N=88) (vs. no conversion, N=100) to AD. In the MCI and AD groups, the systemic analysis demonstrated that the classification outputs were significantly associated with clinical measures (apolipoprotein E genotype, polygenic risk scores, polygenic hazard scores, cerebrospinal fluid Aβ, and Tau, cognitive ability score, the conversion time for progressive MCI subjects and cognitive changes). These findings provide evidence that the radiomic features of Aβ PET images can serve as new biomarkers for clinical applications in AD/MCI, further providing evidence for predicting whether MCI subjects will convert to AD.","Yanhui Ding,Yanhui Ding,Kun Zhao,Kun Zhao,Tongtong Che,Kun Zhao,Tongtong Che,Kai Du,Tongtong Che,Kai Du,Hongzan Sun,Shu Liu,Hongzan Sun,Yilong Yin,Yuanjie Zheng,Shu Liu,Shuyu Li,Yuanjie Zheng,Bing Liu,Shuyu Li,Yong Liu,Bing Liu,Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative,Yong Liu,Yong Liu,Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative",Cerebral Cortex,2021.0

Methods: Data of 244 patients with sinonasal tumor (training set, n=192; test set, n=52) who had undergone pre-contrast MRI, and 101 patients who underwent post-contrast MRI (training set, n=74; test set, n=27) were retrospectively analyzed. Independent predictors of malignancy were identified and their performance were evaluated. Seven radiomics signatures (RSs) using maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR), and the least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were established. The radiomics nomograms, comprising the clinical model and the RS algorithms were built: one based on pre-contrast MRI (RNWOC); the other based on pre-contrast and post-contrast MRI (RNWC). The performances of the models were evaluated with area under the curve (AUC), calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA) respectively. Results: The efficacy of the clinical model (AUC=0.81) of RNWC was higher than that of the model (AUC=0.76) of RNWOC in the test set. There was no significant difference in the AUC of radiomic algorithms in the test set. The RS-T1T2 (AUC=0.74) and RS-T1T2T1C(RSWC, AUC=0.81) achieved a good distinction efficacy in the test set. The RNWC and the RNWOC showed excellent distinction (AUC=0.89 and 0.82 respectively) in the test set. The DCA of the nomograms showed better clinical usefulness than the clinical models and radiomics signatures. Conclusions: The radiomics nomograms combining the clinical model and RS can be accurately, safely, and efficiently used to distinguish between benign and malignant sinonasal tumors.","Shucheng Bi,Shu-cheng Bi,Han Zhang,Han Zhang,Hexiang Wang,Hexiang Wang,Hexiang Wang,Yubin Ge,Yaqiong Ge,Peng Zhang,Peng Zhang,Zhenchang Wang,Dapeng Hao,Zhenchang Wang,Zhen-chang Wang,Dapeng Hao",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0

Consecutive patients (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, January 2018–March 2020; Medical University Vienna, from January 2011–August 2014) with a suspicious enhancing breast tumor on breast MRI categorized as BI-RADS 4 and who subsequently underwent image-guided biopsy were included. In 93 patients (mean age: 49 years ± 12 years; 100% women), there were 104 lesions (mean size: 22.8 mm; range: 7–99 mm), 46 malignant and 58 benign. Radiomics features were calculated. Subsequently, the five most significant features were fitted into multivariable modeling to produce a robust ML model for discriminating between benign and malignant lesions. A medium Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) model with five-fold cross validation was developed for each modality. A model based on DWI-extracted features achieved an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.70–0.88), whereas a model based on DCE-extracted features yielded an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.75–0.91). A multiparametric radiomics model combining DCE- and DWI-extracted features showed the best AUC (0.85; 95% CI: 0.77–0.92) and diagnostic accuracy (81.7%; 95% CI: 73.0–88.6). In conclusion, radiomics analysis coupled with ML of multiparametric MRI allows an improved evaluation of suspicious enhancing breast tumors recommended for biopsy on clinical breast MRI, facilitating accurate breast cancer diagnosis while reducing unnecessary benign breast biopsies.","Isaac Daimiel Naranjo,Isaac Daimiel Naranjo,Peter Gibbs,Peter Gibbs,Jeffrey S.

A robust feature set sensitive to incorrect contouring would provide an ideal quantitative index to drive autocontouring optimization.    Methods  Twenty-five cardiac sub-structures were contoured as regions of interest in 36 CTs. Radiomic features were extracted from manually-contoured (MC) and Hierarchical-Clustering automatic-contouring (AC) structures. A robust feature-set was identified from correctly contoured CT datasets. Features variation was analyzed over a MC/AC dataset. A supervised-learning approach was used to train an Artificial-Intelligence (AI) classifier; incorrect contouring cases were generated from the gold-standard MC datasets with translations, expansions and contractions. ROC curves and confusion matrices were used to evaluate the AI-classifier performance.    Results  Twenty radiomics features, were found to be robust across structures, showing a good/excellent intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) index comparing MC/AC. A significant correlation was obtained with quantitative indexes (Dice-Index, Hausdorff-distance). The trained AI-classifier detected correct contours (CC) and not correct contours (NCC) with an accuracy of 82.6% and AUC of 0.91. True positive rate (TPR) was 85.1% and 81.3% for CC and NCC. Detection of NCC at this point of the development still depended strongly on degree of contouring imperfection.    Conclusions  A set of radiomics features, robust on “gold-standard” contour and sensitive to incorrect contouring was identified and implemented in an AI-workflow to quantify segmentation accuracy. This workflow permits an automatic assessment of segmentation quality and may accelerate expansion of an existing autocontouring atlas database as well as improve dosimetric analyses of large treatment plan databases.","N.

Recently, promising results were achieved in management of cancer patients by extracting mineable high-dimensional data from medical images, supporting clinicians in decision-making process in the new era of target therapy and personalized medicine. Radiomics could provide quantitative data, extracted from medical images, that could reflect microenvironmental tumor heterogeneity, which might be a useful information for treatment tailoring. Thus, it could be helpful to overcome the main limitations of traditional tumor biopsy, often affected by bias in tumor sampling, lack of repeatability and possible procedure complications. This quantitative approach has been widely investigated as a non-invasive and an objective imaging biomarker in cancer patients; however, it is not applied as a clinical routine due to several limitations related to lack of standardization and validation of images acquisition protocols, features segmentation, extraction, processing, and data analysis. This field is in continuous evolution in each type of cancer, and results support the idea that in the future Radiomics might be a reliable application in oncologic imaging. The first part of this review aimed to describe some radiomic technical principles and clinical applications to gastrointestinal oncologic imaging (CT and MRI) with a focus on diagnosis, prediction prognosis, and assessment of response to therapy.","Damiano Caruso,Michela Polici,Damiano Caruso,Marta Zerunian,Michela Polici,Marta Zerunian,Francesco Pucciarelli,Gisella Guido,Francesco Pucciarelli,Tiziano Polidori,Gisella Guido,Tiziano Polidori,Federica Landolfi,Federica Landolfi,Matteo Nicolai,Elena Lucertini,Matteo Nicolai,Elena Lucertini,Mariarita Tarallo,Mariarita Tarallo,Benedetta Bracci,Benedetta Bracci,Ilaria Nacci,Carlotta Rucci,Ilaria Nacci,Carlotta Rucci,Elsa Iannicelli,Elsa Iannicelli,Andréa Laghi,Andrea Laghi",Cancers,2021.0

This approach was tested on two radiomic feature sets generated using two different reconstruction methods on computed tomography (CT) scans from a cohort of 47 lung cancer patients. The largest common network component between the two networks was tested on phantom data consisting of five cancer samples. To further investigate whether radiomic features found can identify phenotypes, we propose a k-means clustering algorithm coupled with the optimal mass transport theory. This approach following the regularized partial correlation network analysis was tested on CT scans from 77 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients in the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and validated using an independent dataset.Results: A set of common radiomic features was found in relatively large network components between the resultant two partial correlation networks resulting from a cohort of lung cancer patients. The reliability and reproducibility of those radiomic features were further validated on phantom data using the Wasserstein distance. Further analysis using the network-based Wasserstein k-means algorithm on the TCIA HNSCC data showed that the resulting clusters separate tumor subsites as well as HPV status, and this was validated on an independent dataset.Conclusion: We showed that a network-based analysis enables identifying reproducible radiomic features and use of the selected set of features can enhance clustering results.","Jung Hun Oh,Aditya Apte,Jung Hun Oh,Aditya Apte,Evangelia Katsoulakis,Evangelia Katsoulakis,Nadeem Riaz,Nadeem Riaz,Vaios Hatzoglou,Vaios Hatzoglou,Yao Yu,Yao Yu,Usman Mahmood,Usman Mahmood,Harini Veeraraghavan,Harini Veeraraghavan,Maryam Pouryahya,Maryam Pouryahya,Aditi Iyer,Aditi Iyer,Amita Shukla‐Dave,Allen Tannenbaum,Amita Shukla-Dave,Nancy Y.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of TCGA-TCIA (The Cancer Genome Atlas and The Cancer Imaging Archive)-based CT radiomics for noninvasive prediction of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status in gastric cancer (GC). MATERIALS AND METHODS. A total of 133 patients with pathologically confirmed GC (94 in the training cohort and 39 in the validation cohort) who were identified from the TCGA-TCIA public data repository and two hospitals were retrospectively enrolled in the study. Two-dimensional and 3D radiomics features were extracted to construct corresponding radiomics signatures. Then, 2D and 3D nomograms were built by combining radiomics signatures and clinical information on the basis of multivariable analysis. Their performance and clinical practicability were determined, validated, and compared with respect to discrimination, calibration, reclassification, and time spent on tumor segmentation. RESULTS. Both 2D and 3D nomograms were robust and showed good calibration. The AUCs of the 2D and 3D nomograms showed no significant difference in the training cohort (0.919 vs 0.945, respectively; p = .41) or validation cohort (0.939 vs 0.955, respectively; p = .71). The net reclassification index showed that the 3D nomogram revealed no significant improvement in risk reclassification when compared with the 2D nomogram in the training cohort (net reclassification index, 0.68%; p = .14) and the validation cohort (net reclassification index, 6.06%; p = .08). Of note, the time spent on 3D segmentation (median, 907 seconds) was higher than that spent on 2D segmentation (median, 129 seconds). CONCLUSION. The 2D and 3D radiomics nomograms might have the potential to be used as effective tools for prediction of EBV in GC. When time spent on segmentation is considered, the 2D nomogram is more highly recommended for clinical application.","Huifang Zhao,Weiwei Li,Huiping Zhao,Peijie Lyu,Wei-Wei Li,Peijie Lyu,Xiao Zhang,Xiao Zhang,Huan Liu,Pan Liang,Huan Liu,Pan Liang,Jianbo Gao,Jianbo Gao",American Journal of Roentgenology,2021.0
10.3390/molecules26082201,,,"The Future of Cancer Diagnosis, Treatment and Surveillance: A Systemic Review on Immunotherapy and Immuno-PET Radiotracers","Immunotherapy is an effective therapeutic option for several cancers. In the last years, the introduction of checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has shifted the therapeutic landscape in oncology and improved patient prognosis in a variety of neoplastic diseases. However, to date, the selection of the best patients eligible for these therapies, as well as the response assessment is still challenging. Patients are mainly stratified using an immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of antigens on biopsy specimens, such as PD-L1 and PD-1, on tumor cells, on peritumoral immune cells and/or in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recently, the use and development of imaging biomarkers able to assess in-vivo cancer-related processes are becoming more important. Today, positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) is used routinely to evaluate tumor metabolism, and also to predict and monitor response to immunotherapy. Although highly sensitive, FDG-PET in general is rather unspecific. Novel radiopharmaceuticals (immuno-PET radiotracers), able to identify specific immune system targets, are under investigation in pre-clinical and clinical settings to better highlight all the mechanisms involved in immunotherapy. In this review, we will provide an overview of the main new immuno-PET radiotracers in development. We will also review the main players (immune cells, tumor cells and molecular targets) involved in immunotherapy. Furthermore, we report current applications and the evidence of using [18F]FDG PET in immunotherapy, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI).","Virginia Liberini,Riccardo Laudicella,Virginia Liberini,Riccardo Laudicella,Martina Capozza,Riccardo Laudicella,Martina Capozza,Martin W.

10.1371/journal.pone.0251147,33961646.0,,The application of a workflow integrating the variable reproducibility and harmonizability of radiomic features on a phantom dataset.,"Radiomics-the high throughput extraction of quantitative features from medical images and their correlation with clinical and biological endpoints- is the subject of active and extensive research. Although the field shows promise, the generalizability of radiomic signatures is affected significantly by differences in scan acquisition and reconstruction settings. Previous studies reported on the sensitivity of radiomic features (RFs) to test-retest variability, inter-observer segmentation variability, and intra-scanner variability. A framework involving robust radiomics analysis and the application of a post-reconstruction feature harmonization method using ComBat was recently proposed to address these challenges. In this study, we investigated the reproducibility of RFs across different scanners and scanning parameters using this framework. We analysed thirteen scans of a ten-layer phantom that were acquired differently. Each layer was subdivided into sixteen regions of interest (ROIs), and the scans were compared in a pairwise manner, resulting in seventy-eight different scenarios. Ninety-one RFs were extracted from each ROI. As hypothesized, we demonstrate that the reproducibility of a given RF is not a constant but is dependent on the heterogeneity found in the data under analysis. The number (%) of reproducible RFs varied across the pairwise scenarios investigated, having a wide range between 8 (8.8%) and 78 (85.7%) RFs. Furthermore, in contrast to what has been previously reported, and as hypothesized in the robust radiomics analysis framework, our results demonstrate that ComBat cannot be applied to all RFs but rather on a percentage of those-the ""ComBatable"" RFs-which differed depending on the data being harmonized. The number (%) of reproducible RFs following ComBat harmonization varied across the pairwise scenarios investigated, ranging from 14 (15.4%) to 80 (87.9%) RFs, and was found to depend on the heterogeneity in the data. We conclude that the standardization of image acquisition protocols remains the cornerstone for improving the reproducibility of RFs, and the generalizability of the signatures developed. Our proposed approach helps identify the reproducible RFs across different datasets.","Abdalla Ibrahim,Abdalla Ibrahim,Ralph T.H. Leijenaar,Sergey Primakov,Ralph T.H.

The Google scholar database was interrogated to find additional studies. Seven studies were ultimately included in the systematic review and summarized in two relevant clinical sections: (1) primary staging and (2) restaging. In primary staging, RFs, extracted from 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET may characterize intraprostatic radiotracer hotspots in patients with high- and intermediate-risk, discriminate between Gleason Score (GS) 7 and≥8 and between pN1 and pN0 disease, and suggest presence of intraprostatic lesions missed at visual PET examination. Machine learning (ML) may help selecting RFs able to predict risk classification (low vs. high), lymph node involvement, presence of nodal or distant metastasis, GS and extracapsular extension. At restaging, PET_Kurtosis may correlate with OS in patients with advanced PCa scheduled for 177Lu-PSMA treatment, whereas ML may assist discrimination of malignant lesions from physiologic/unspecific tracer accumulation, and predict disease progression. To date, although PET literature appears still too narrow to draw definitive conclusions, PET-derived RFs appear promising in PCa. ML seems an important tool that may contribute to the widespread use of radiomics and subsequent implementation in the clinical setting.","Natale Quartuccio,Natale Quartuccio,Maurizio Marrale,Maurizio Marrale,Riccardo Laudicella,Pierpaolo Alongi,Riccardo Laudicella,Massimiliano Siracusa,Pierpaolo Alongi,Letterio Sturiale,Massimiliano Siracusa,Giuseppe Arnone,Letterio Sturiale,Giuseppe Cutaia,Giuseppe Arnone,Giuseppe Cutaia,Giuseppe Salvaggio,Massimo Midiri,Giuseppe Salvaggio,Massimo Midiri,Sergio Baldari,Gaspare Arnone,Sergio Baldari,Gaspare Arnone",Clinical and Translational Imaging,2021.0

METHODS For this retrospective study, 121 lung adenocarcinomas appearing as ground-glass nodules on thin-section CT were evaluated. Quantitative radiomic features were extracted from the peritumoral parenchymal region of 2 mm and 5 mm on CT imaging, and the radiomic models of External2 and External5 were constructed. The ROC curves were used to evaluate the performance of different models. Differences between the AUCs were evaluated using DeLong's method. RESULTS The radiomic scores of IAC were statistically higher than those of MIA/AIS in both the External2 and External5 models. The AUCs of the External2 and External5 models were 0.882, 0.778 in the training cohort and 0.888, 0.804 in the validation cohort, respectively. The AUC of the External2 model was not statistically different from the External5 model both in the training cohort (p = 0.116) and validation cohort (p = 0.423). CONCLUSIONS The radiomic features extracted from the peritumoral region of 2 mm and 5 mm at thin-section CT showed good predictive values to differentiate the IAC from AIS/MIA. The radiomic features from the peritumoral region of 5 mm provide no additional benefit in distinguishing IAC from MIA/AIS than that of the 2 mm region. KEY POINTS • The radiomic models from various peritumoral lung parenchyma were developed and validated to predict invasiveness of adenocarcinoma. • The peritumoral parenchyma of lung adenocarcinoma may contain useful information. • Radiomics from peritumoral lung parenchyma of 5 mm provides no added efficiency of the prediction for invasiveness of lung adenocarcinoma.","Linyu Wu,Linyu Wu,Chen Gao,Jianfeng Ye,Chen Gao,Jingying Tao,Jianfeng Ye,Neng Wang,Jingying Tao,Peipei Pang,Neng Wang,Ping Xiang,Peipei Pang,Maosheng Xu,Ping Xiang,Maosheng Xu",European Radiology,2021.0

S-1 is a recently emerged oral antitumour agent recommended by the guidelines. However, which population would benefit from S-1 needs to be determined, and predictors of chemotherapy response are needed for personalized precision medicine. This pilot study aimed to initially identify whether whole-tumour evaluation with MRI and radiomics features could be used for predicting the efficacy of S-1 and to find potential predictors of the efficacy of S-1 as evidence to assist personalized precision treatment.  Methods  Forty-six patients with PDAC (31 in the primary cohort and 15 in the validation cohort) who underwent curative resection and subsequently adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 were included. Pre-operative abdominal contrast-enhanced MRI was performed, and radiomics features of the whole PDAC were extracted from the primary cohort. After univariable analysis and radiomics features selection, a multivariable Cox regression model for survival analysis was subsequently used to select statistically significant factors associated with postoperative disease-free survival (DFS). Predictive capacities of the factors were tested on the validation cohort by using Kaplan-Meier method.  Results  Multivariable Cox regression analysis identified the probability of T1WI_NGTDM_Strength and tumour location as independent predictors of the efficacy of S-1 for adjuvant chemotherapy of PDAC (p = 0.005 and 0.013) in the primary cohort, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.289 and 0.293, respectively. Further survival analysis showed that patients in the low-T1WI_NGTDM_Strength group had shorter DFS (median = 5.1 m) than those in the high-T1WI_NGTDM_Strength group (median = 13.0 m) (p = 0.006), and patients with PDAC on the pancreatic head exhibited shorter DFS (median = 7.0 m) than patients with tumours in other locations (median = 20.0 m) (p = 0.016). In the validation cohort, the difference in DFS between patients with low-T1WI_NGTDM_Strength and high-T1WI_NGTDM_Strength and the difference between patients with PDAC on the pancreatic head and that in other locations were approved, with marginally significant (p = 0.073 and 0.050), respectively.  Conclusions  Whole-tumour radiomics feature of T1WI_NGTDM_Strength and tumour location were potential predictors of the efficacy of S-1 and for the precision selection of S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for PDAC.","Liang Liang,Ying Ding,Liang Liang,Yiyi Yu,Ying Ding,Kai Li,Yiyi Yu,Kai Liu,Kai Liu,Sheng-Xiang Rao,Yubin Ge,Sheng-Xiang Rao,Yingqian Ge,Mengsu Zeng,Mengsu Zeng",BMC Medical Imaging,2021.0

The distinction between diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers is made and emphasis placed on the need to assess clinical utility within the context of a multivariable model. Such models should not be restricted to imaging biomarkers and must include relevant disease and patient characteristics likely to be clinically useful. Biomarker utility is based on whether its addition to the basic clinical model improves diagnosis or prediction. Approaches to both model development and evaluation are explained and the need for adequate amounts of representative data stressed so as to avoid underpowering and overfitting. Advice is provided regarding how to report the research correctly. KEY POINTS: • Imaging biomarker research is common but methodological errors are encountered frequently that may mean the research is not clinically useful. • The clinical utility of imaging biomarkers is best assessed by their additive effect on multivariable models based on clinical factors known to be important. • The data used to develop such models should be sufficient for the number of variables investigated and the model should be evaluated, preferably using data unrelated to development.","Steve Halligan,Y.

10.3390/diagnostics11061047,,,A Cascaded Neural Network for Staging in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Using Pre-Treatment CT.,"Background and aim: Tumor staging in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is important for treatment and prognosis. Staging involves expert interpretation of imaging, which we aim to automate with deep learning (DL). We proposed a cascaded DL method comprised of two steps to classification between early- and advanced-stage NSCLC using pretreatment computed tomography. Methods: We developed and tested a DL model to classify between early- and advanced-stage using training (n = 90), validation (n = 8), and two test (n = 37, n = 26) cohorts obtained from the public domain. The first step adopted an autoencoder network to compress the imaging data into latent variables and the second step used the latent variable to classify the stages using the convolutional neural network (CNN). Other DL and machine learning-based approaches were compared. Results: Our model was tested in two test cohorts of CPTAC and TCGA. In CPTAC, our model achieved accuracy of 0.8649, sensitivity of 0.8000, specificity of 0.9412, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8206 compared to other approaches (AUC 0.6824–0.7206) for classifying between early- and advanced-stages. In TCGA, our model achieved accuracy of 0.8077, sensitivity of 0.7692, specificity of 0.8462, and AUC of 0.8343. Conclusion: Our cascaded DL model for classification NSCLC patients into early-stage and advanced-stage showed promising results and could help future NSCLC research.","Ji Eun Choi,Jieun Choi,H.

10.3389/fonc.2021.634879,,,A Clinical-Radiomic Nomogram Based on Unenhanced Computed Tomography for Predicting the Risk of Aldosterone-Producing Adenoma.,"Purpose  To develop and validate a clinical-radiomic nomogram for the preoperative prediction of the aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) risk in patients with unilateral adrenal adenoma.  Patients and methods  Ninety consecutive primary aldosteronism (PA) patients with unilateral adrenal adenoma who underwent adrenal venous sampling (AVS) were randomly separated into training (n = 62) and validation cohorts (n = 28) (7:3 ratio) by a computer algorithm. Data were collected from October 2017 to June 2020. The prediction model was developed in the training cohort. Radiomic features were extracted from unenhanced computed tomography (CT) images of unilateral adrenal adenoma. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used to reduce data dimensions, select features, and establish a radiomic signature. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used for the predictive model development, the radiomic signature and clinical risk factors integration, and the model was displayed as a clinical-radiomic nomogram. The nomogram performance was evaluated by its calibration, discrimination, and clinical practicability. Internal validation was performed.  Results  Six potential predictors were selected from 358 texture features by using the LASSO regression model. These features were included in the Radscore. The predictors included in the individualized prediction nomogram were the Radscore, age, sex, serum potassium level, and aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR). The model showed good discrimination, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.900 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.807 to 0.993], and good calibration. The nomogram still showed good discrimination [AUC, 0.912 (95% CI, 0.761 to 1.000)] and good calibration in the validation cohort. Decision curve analysis presented that the nomogram was useful in clinical practice.  Conclusions  A clinical-radiomic nomogram was constructed by integrating a radiomic signature and clinical factors. The nomogram facilitated accurate prediction of the probability of APA in patients with unilateral adrenal nodules and could be helpful for clinical decision making.","Keng He,Zhaotao Zhang,Keng He,Zhao-Tao Zhang,Zhenhua Wang,Zhen-Hua Wang,Yu Wang,Yu Wang,Yixi Wang,Yi-Xi Wang,Hongzhou Zhang,Hong-Zhou Zhang,Dong Yan,Xinlan Xiao,Yi-Fei Dong,Xin-Lan Xiao",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0
10.1155/2021/6641384,,,A Nanoradiomics Approach for Differentiation of Tumors Based on Tumor-Associated Macrophage Burden.,"Objective. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) within the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) of solid tumors play an important role in treatment resistance and disease recurrence. The purpose of this study was to investigate if nanoradiomics (radiomic analysis of nanoparticle contrast-enhanced images) can differentiate tumors based on TAM burden. Materials and Methods. In vivo studies were performed in transgenic mouse models of neuroblastoma with low (N=11) and high (N=10) tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) burden. Animals underwent delayed nanoparticle contrast-enhanced CT (n-CECT) imaging at 4 days after intravenous administration of liposomal-iodine agent (1.1g/kg). CT imaging-derived conventional tumor metrics (tumor volume and CT attenuation) were computed for segmented tumor CT datasets. Nanoradiomic analysis was performed using a PyRadiomics workflow implemented in the quantitative image feature pipeline (QIFP) server containing 900 radiomic features (RFs). RF selection was performed under supervised machine learning using a nonparametric neighborhood component method. A 5-fold validation was performed using a set of linear and nonlinear classifiers for group separation. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal–Wallis test. Results. N-CECT imaging demonstrated heterogeneous patterns of signal enhancement in low and high TAM tumors. CT imaging-derived conventional tumor metrics showed no significant differences (                         )   in tumor volume between low and high TAM tumors. Tumor CT attenuation was not significantly different (                         )   between low and high TAM tumors. Machine learning-augmented nanoradiomic analysis revealed two RFs that differentiated (                            )   low TAM and high TAM tumors. The RFs were used to build a linear classifier that demonstrated very high accuracy and further confirmed by 5-fold cross-validation. Conclusions. Imaging-derived conventional tumor metrics were unable to differentiate tumors with varying TAM burden; however, nanoradiomic analysis revealed texture differences and enabled differentiation of low and high TAM tumors.","Zbigniew Starosolski,Zbigniew Starosolski,Amy N.

METHODS 638 patients confirmed as axSpA (n= 424) or non-axSpA (n = 214) who were randomly divided into training (n = 447) and validation cohorts (n = 191). Optimal radiomics signatures were constructed from the 3.0T SIJ-MRI using maximum relevance-minimum redundancy (mRMR) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm in the training cohort. We also included six clinical risk predictors to build clinical model. Incorporating the independent clinical factors and Rad-score, a nomogram model was constructed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. The performance of the clinical, Rad-score, and nomogram model were evaluated by ROC analysis, calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS 1316 features were extracted and reduced to 15 features to build the Rad-score. The Rad-score allowed a good discrimination in the training (AUC, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.77-0.86) and the validation cohort (AUC, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76-0.88). The clinical-radiomics nomogram model also showed favorable discrimination in the training (AUC, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.93) and the validation cohort (AUC, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85-0.94). Calibration curves (p>0.05) and DCA demonstrated the nomogram was useful for axSpA diagnosis in the clinical environment. CONCLUSION The study proposed a radiomics model was able to separate axSpA and non-axSpA. The clinical-radiomics nomogram can increase the efficacy for differentiating axSpA, which might facilitate clinical decision-making process.","Lusi Ye,Lusi Ye,Shouliang Miao,Shouliang Miao,Qin Xiao,Yuncai Liu,Qinqin Xiao,Yuncai Liu,Hongyan Tang,Hongyan Tang,Bingyu Li,Jinjin Liu,Bingyu Li,Dan Chen,Jinjin Liu,Dan Chen",Rheumatology,2021.0

10.1371/journal.pone.0253653,34197503.0,,A transfer learning approach to facilitate ComBat-based harmonization of multicentre radiomic features in new datasets.,"PURPOSE To facilitate the demonstration of the prognostic value of radiomics, multicenter radiomics studies are needed. Pooling radiomic features of such data in a statistical analysis is however challenging, as they are sensitive to the variability in scanner models, acquisition protocols and reconstruction settings, which is often unavoidable in a multicentre retrospective analysis. A statistical harmonization strategy called ComBat was utilized in radiomics studies to deal with the ""center-effect"". The goal of the present work was to integrate a transfer learning (TL) technique within ComBat-and recently developed alternate versions of ComBat with improved flexibility (M-ComBat) and robustness (B-ComBat)-to allow the use of a previously determined harmonization transform to the radiomic feature values of new patients from an already known center. MATERIAL AND METHODS The proposed TL approach were incorporated in the four versions of ComBat (standard, B, M, and B-M ComBat). The proposed approach was evaluated using a dataset of 189 locally advanced cervical cancer patients from 3 centers, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images, with the clinical endpoint of predicting local failure. The impact performance of the TL approach was evaluated by comparing the harmonization achieved using only parts of the data to the reference (harmonization achieved using all the available data). It was performed through three different machine learning pipelines. RESULTS The proposed TL technique was successful in harmonizing features of new patients from a known center in all versions of ComBat, leading to predictive models reaching similar performance as the ones developed using the features harmonized with all the data available. CONCLUSION The proposed TL approach enables applying a previously determined ComBat transform to new, previously unseen data.","Ronrick Da-ano,François Lucia,R. Da-ano,Ingrid Masson,F.

METHODS The clinical data of 12 patients with rare malignant mesenchymal tumours of the maxillofacial region (6 cases of sarcoma and 6 cases of lymphoma) treated in the hospital from May 2018 to June 2020 and were confirmed by postoperative pathology were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were all examined by 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging. PyRadiomics were used to extract radiomics imaging first-order features. Group differences in quantitative variables were examined using independent-samples t-tests. RESULTS The voxels number of ADCmean and ADCmedian of sarcoma tissues were 44.9124 and 44.2064, respectively, significantly higher than those in lymphoma tissues (ADCmean (-68.8379) and ADCmedian (-74.0045)), the difference considered statistically significant, so do the ADCkurt and ADCskew. CONCLUSIONS The statistical difference of ADCmean and ADCmedian is significant, it is consistent with the outcome of the manual measurement of the ADC mean value of the most significant cross-section of twelve cases of lymphoma. Development of tumour volume based on the ADC parameter map of DWI demonstrates that the first-order ADC radiomics features analysis can provide new imaging markers for the differentiation of maxillofacial sarcoma and lymphoma. Therefore, first-order ADC features of ADCkurt combined ADCskew may improve the diagnosis level.","Baoting Yu,Chencui Huang,Baoting Yu,Shuo Liu,Chencui Huang,Shuo Liu,Tong Li,Tong Liu,Yuyao Guan,Yuyao Guan,Tong Li,Yuyao Guan,Xiange Zheng,Xuewei Zheng,Junjun Ding,Jun Ding",,2021.0

10.1155/2021/5566885,,,Assessment of MRI-Based Radiomics in Preoperative T Staging of Rectal Cancer: Comparison between Minimum and Maximum Delineation Methods.,"The manual delineation of the lesion is mainly used as a conventional segmentation method, but it is subjective and has poor stability and repeatability. The purpose of this study is to validate the effect of a radiomics model based on MRI derived from two delineation methods in the preoperative T staging of patients with rectal cancer (RC). A total of 454 consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed RC who underwent preoperative MRI between January 2018 and December 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. RC patients were grouped according to whether the muscularis propria was penetrated. Two radiologists segmented lesions, respectively, by minimum delineation (Method 1) and maximum delineation (Method 2), after which radiomics features were extracted. Inter- and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of all features was evaluated. After feature reduction, the support vector machine (SVM) was trained to build a prediction model. The diagnostic performances of models were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Then, the areas under the curve (AUCs) were compared by the DeLong test. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to evaluate clinical benefit. Finally, 317 patients were assessed, including 152 cases in the training set and 165 cases in the validation set. Moreover, 1288/1409 (91.4%) features of Method 1 and 1273/1409 (90.3%) features of Method 2 had good robustness (                          ).   The AUCs of Model 1 and Model 2 were 0.808 and 0.903 in the validation set, respectively (                             ).   DCA showed that the maximum delineation yielded more net benefit. MRI-based radiomics models derived from two segmentation methods demonstrated good performance in the preoperative T staging of RC. The minimum delineation had better stability in feature selection, while the maximum delineation method was more clinically beneficial.","Haidi Lu,Yuan Yuan,Haidi Lu,Yuan Yuan,Zhen Zhou,Xiaolu Ma,Zhen Zhou,Shoukuan Fu,Xiaolu Ma,Fu Shen,Yuwei Xia,Yuwei Xia,Jianping Lu,Jianping Lu,Jianping Lu",BioMed Research International,2021.0
10.1088/1361-6560/ac1458,34261044.0,,CT radiomic features of photodynamic priming in clinical pancreatic adenocarcinoma treatment.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers localized focal ablation in unresectable pancreatic tumors while tissues surrounding the treatment volume experience a lower light dose, termed photodynamic priming (PDP). While PDP does not cause tissue damage, it has been demonstrated to promote vascular permeability, improve drug delivery, alleviate tumor cell density, and reduce desmoplasia and the resultant internal pressure in pre-clinical evaluation. Preclinical data supports PDP as a neoadjuvant therapy beneficial to subsequent chemotherapy or immunotherapy, yet it is challenging to quantify PDP effects in clinical treatment without additional imaging and testing. This study investigated the potential of radiomic analysis using CT scans acquired before and after PDT to identify areas experiencing PDT-induced necrosis as well as quantify PDP effects in the surrounding tissues. A total of 235 CT tumor slices from 7 patients undergoing PDT for pancreatic tumors were examined. Radiomic features assessed included intensity metrics (CT number in Hounsfield Units) and texture analysis using several Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) parameters. Pre-treatment scans of tumor areas that resulted in PDT-induced necrosis showed statistically significant differences in intensity and texture-based features that could be used to predict the regions that did respond (paired t-test, response vs no response, p < 0.001). Evaluation of PDP effects on the surrounding tissues also demonstrated statistically significant differences, in tumor mean value, standard deviation, and GLCM parameters of contrast, dissimilarity and homogeneity (t-test, pre vs post, p < 0.001). Using leave-one-out cross validation, six intensity and texture-based features were combined into a support-vector machine model which demonstrated reliable prediction of treatment effects for 6 out of 7 patients (ROC curve, AUC = 0.93).

Materials and Methods: Retrospective evaluation of the imaging was conducted for a study cohort of uterine cervical cancer, candidates for radical treatment with chemo radiation. ADC values were calculated from the darkest part of the tumor, both before (labeled preADC) and post treatment (labeled postADC) with chemo radiation. Post extraction of 851 Radiomics features and feature selection analysis—by taking the union of the features that had Pearson correlation >0.35 for recurrence, >0.49 for lymph node and >0.40 for metastasis—was performed to predict clinical outcomes. Results: The study enrolled 52 patients who presented with variable FIGO stages in the age range of 28–79 (Median = 53 years) with a median follow-up of 26.5 months (range: 7–76 months). Disease recurrence occurred in 12 patients (23%). Metastasis occurred in 15 patients (28%). A model generated with 24 radiomics features and preADC using a monotone multi-layer perceptron neural network to predict the recurrence yields an AUC of 0.80 and a Kappa value of 0.55 and shows that the addition of radiomics features to ADC values improves the statistical metrics by approximately 40% for AUC and approximately 223% for Kappa. Similarly, the neural network model for prediction of metastasis returns an AUC value of 0.84 and a Kappa value of 0.65, thus exceeding performance expectations by approximately 25% for AUC and approximately 140% for Kappa. There was a significant input of GLSZM features (SALGLE and LGLZE) and GLDM features (SDLGLE and DE) in correlation with clinical outcomes of recurrence and metastasis. Conclusions: The study is an effort to bridge the unmet need of translational predictive biomarkers in the stratification of uterine cervical cancer patients based on prognosis.","Ankush Jajodia,Ayushi Gupta,Ankush Jajodia,A.

We conducted a retrospective analysis to explore and validate radiomics model based on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) to predict recurrence of locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell cancer (SCC) within 2 years after trimodal therapy. This study collected CECT and clinical data of consecutive 220 patients with pathology-confirmed locally advanced oesophageal SCC (154 in the training cohort and 66 in the validation cohort). Univariate statistical test and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method were performed to select the optimal radiomics features. Logistic regression was conducted to build radiomics model, clinical model, and combined model of both the radiomics and clinical features. Predictive performance was judged by the area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), accuracy, and F1-score in the training and validation cohorts. Ten optimal radiomics features and/or 7 clinical features were selected to build radiomics model, clinical model, and the combined model. The integrated model of radiomics and clinical features was superior to radiomics model or clinical model in predicting recurrence of locally advanced oesophageal SCC within 2 years in the training (AUC: 0.879 vs 0.815 or 0.763; accuracy: 0.844 vs 0.773 or 0.740; and F1-score: 0.886 vs 0.839 or 0.815, respectively) and validation (AUC: 0.857 vs 0.720 or 0.750; accuracy: 0.788 vs 0.700 or 0.697; and F1-score: 0.851 vs 0.800 or 0.787, respectively) cohorts.

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to develop and validate a radiomics model to discriminate patients with pancreatic cancer and liver metastases from those with other metastatic patterns. METHODS We evaluated 77 patients who had APC and performed texture analysis on the region of interest. 58 patients and 19 patients were allocated randomly into the training and validation cohorts with almost the same proportion of liver metastases. An independentsamples t-test was used for feature selection in the training cohort. Random forest classifier was used to construct models based on these features and a radiomics signature (RS) was derived. A nomogram was constructed based on RS and CA19-9, and was validated with calibration plot and decision curve. The prognostic value of RS was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier methods. RESULTS The constructed nomogram demonstrated good discrimination in the training (AUC = 0.93) and validation (AUC = 0.81) cohorts. In both cohorts, patients with RS > 0.61 had much poorer overall survival than patients with RS < 0.61. CONCLUSIONS This study presents a radiomics nomogram incorporating RS and CA19-9 to discriminate patients who have APC with liver metastases from patients with other metastatic patterns.","Tianliang Zhang,Tianliang Zhang,Xiao Dong,Yang Zhou,Xiao Dong,Muhan Liu,Yang Zhou,Junjie Hang,Muhan Liu,Lixia Wu,Junjie Hang,Lixia Wu",Cancer Biomarkers,2021.0

The purpose of our study was to develop a radiomics model based on preoperative MRI and clinical information for predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with advanced high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study enrolled 117 patients with HGSOC, including 90 patients with recurrence and 27 without recurrence; 1046 radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted images and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images using a manual segmentation method. L1 regularization-based least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was performed to select features, and the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was used to balance our dataset. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to build the classification model. To validate the performance of the proposed models, we applied a leave-one-out cross-validation method to train and test the classifier. Cox proportional hazards regression, Harrell concordance index (C-index), and Kaplan-Meier plots analysis were used to evaluate the associations between radiomics signatures and RFS. RESULTS. The fusion radiomics-based model yielded a significantly higher AUC value of 0.85 in evaluating RFS than the model using contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging features alone or T2-weighted imaging features alone (AUC = 0.79 and 0.74 and p = .02 and .01, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed significant differences between high and low recurrence risk in patients with HGSOC by different models. The fusion model combining radiomics features and clinical information showed higher performance than the clinical model (C-index = 0.62 and 0.60, respectively). CONCLUSION. The proposed MRI-based radiomics signatures may provide a potential way to develop a prediction model and can help identify patients with advanced HGSOC who have a high risk of recurrence.","Hai Ming Li,Jing Gong,Hai Ming Li,Rui Min Li,Jing Gong,Rui Min Li,Ze Bin Xiao,Ze Bin Xiao,Jin Wei Qiang,Jin Wei Qiang,Wei Peng,Yajuan Gu,Wei Jun Peng,Ya Jia Gu",American Journal of Roentgenology,2021.0

Preoperative assessments and predictions, including risk stratification, responses to therapy, long-term clinical outcomes, and gene mutation status, are crucial to guide the optimization of personalized treatment strategies. Radiomics is a novel approach that enables the evaluation of the heterogeneity and biological behavior of tumors by quantitative extraction of features from medical imaging. As these extracted features cannot be captured by visual inspection, the field holds significant promise. Recent studies have proved the rapid development of radiomics and validated its diagnostic and predictive efficacy. Nonetheless, existing radiomics research on RC is highly heterogeneous due to challenges in workflow standardization and limitations of objective cohort conditions. Here, we present a summary of existing research based on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.

10.1109/access.2021.3088234,,,Genotype-Guided Radiomics Signatures for Recurrence Prediction of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a serious disease and has a high recurrence rate after the surgery. Recently, many machine learning methods have been proposed for recurrence prediction. The methods using gene data have high prediction accuracy but require high cost. Although the radiomics signatures using only CT image are not expensive, its accuracy is relatively low. In this paper, we propose a genotype-guided radiomics method (GGR) for obtaining high prediction accuracy with low cost. We used a public radiogenomics dataset of NSCLC, which includes CT images and gene data. The proposed method is a two-step method, which consists of two models. The first model is a gene estimation model, which is used to estimate the gene expression from radiomics features and deep features extracted from computer tomography (CT) image. The second model is used to predict the recurrence using the estimated gene expression data. The proposed GGR method designed based on hybrid features which is combination of handcrafted-based and deep learning-based. The experiments demonstrated that the prediction accuracy can be improved significantly from 78.61% (existing radiomics method) and 79.14% (deep learning method) to 83.28% by the proposed GGR.","Panyanat Aonpong,Panyanat Aonpong,Yutaro Iwamoto,Yutaro Iwamoto,Xian-Hua Han,Lanfen Lin,Xian-Hua Han,Yen Wei Chen,Lanfen Lin,Lanfen Lin,Lanfen Lin,Yen-Wei Chen,Yen-Wei Chen",IEEE Access,2021.0

The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of applying handcrafted radiomics (HCR) and deep learning-based radiomics (DLR) for the accurate preoperative classification of glioblastoma (GBM) and solitary brain metastasis (BM). Methods. A retrospective analysis of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 140 patients (110 in the training dataset and 30 in the test dataset) with GBM and 128 patients (98 in the training dataset and 30 in the test dataset) with BM confirmed by surgical pathology was performed. The regions of interest (ROIs) on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and contrast-enhanced T1WI (T1CE) were drawn manually, and then, HCR and DLR analyses were performed. On this basis, different machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared to find the optimal modeling method. The final classifiers were identified and validated for different MRI modalities using HCR features and HCR+DLR features. By analyzing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to evaluate the predictive efficacy of different methods. Results. In multiclassifier modeling, random forest modeling showed the best distinguishing performance among all MRI modalities. HCR models already showed good results for distinguishing between the two types of brain tumors in the test dataset (T1WI, AUC=0.86; T2WI, AUC=0.76; T1CE, AUC=0.93). By adding DLR features, all AUCs showed significant improvement (T1WI, AUC=0.87; T2WI, AUC=0.80; T1CE, AUC=0.97;                          ).   The T1CE-based radiomic model showed the best classification performance (AUC=0.99 in the training dataset and AUC=0.97 in the test dataset), surpassing the other MRI modalities (                         ).   The multimodality radiomic model also showed robust performance (AUC=1 in the training dataset and AUC=0.84 in the test dataset). Conclusion. Machine learning models using MRI radiomic features can help distinguish GBM from BM effectively, especially the combination of HCR and DLR features.","Zhiyuan Liu,Zekun Jiang,Zhiyuan Liu,Zekun Jiang,Zekun Jiang,Meng Li,Jun Yang,Jun Yang,Li Meng,Jun Yang,Ying Liu,Yingying Zhang,Ying Liu,Haiqin Peng,Yingying Zhang,Jiahui Li,Haiqin Peng,Jiahui Li,Gang Xiao,Zijian Zhang,Gang Xiao,Rongrong Zhou,Zijian Zhang,Rongrong Zhou",Journal of Oncology,2021.0

However, there exists limited consensus on which patients with a negative prostate mpMRI could avoid prostate biopsy. PURPOSE To identify which patient could safely avoid prostate biopsy when the prostate mpMRI is negative, via a radiomics-based machine learning approach. STUDY TYPE Retrospective. SUBJECTS Three hundred thirty patients with negative prostate 3T mpMRI between January 2016 and December 2018 were included. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE A 3.0T/T2-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) imaging (T2 WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). ASSESSMENT The integrative machine learning (iML) model was trained to predict negative prostate biopsy results, utilizing both radiomics and clinical features. The final study cohort comprised 330 consecutive patients with negative mpMRI (PI-RADS<3) who underwent systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) or MR-ultrasound fusion (MRUS) biopsy within 6months. A secondary analysis of biopsy naive subcohort (n=227) was also conducted. STATISTICAL TESTS The Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-Squared test were utilized to evaluate the significance of difference of clinical features between prostate biopsy positive and negative groups. The model performance was validated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and measured by AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV). RESULTS Overall, 306/330 (NPV 92.7%) of the final study cohort patients had negative biopsies, and 207/227 (NPV 91.2%) of the biopsy naive subcohort patients had negative biopsies. Our iML model achieved NPVs of 98.3% and 98.0% for the study cohort and subcohort, respectively, superior to prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD)-based risk assessment with NPVs of 94.9% and 93.9%, respectively. DATA CONCLUSION The proposed iML model achieved high performance in predicting negative prostate biopsy results for patients with negative mpMRI. With improved NPVs, the proposed model can be used to stratify patients who in whom we might obviate biopsies, thus reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies.

10.1155/2021/5566508,,,Investigation of Radiation-Induced Toxicity in Head and Neck Cancer Patients through Radiomics and Machine Learning: A Systematic Review.,"Background. Radiation-induced toxicity represents a crucial concern in oncological treatments of patients affected by head and neck neoplasms, due to its impact on survivors’ quality of life. Published reports suggested the potential of radiomics combined with machine learning methods in the prediction and assessment of radiation-induced toxicities, supporting a tailored radiation treatment management. In this paper, we present an update of the current knowledge concerning these modern approaches. Materials and Methods. A systematic review according to PICO-PRISMA methodology was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE databases until June 2019. Studies assessing the use of radiomics combined with machine learning in predicting radiation-induced toxicity in head and neck cancer patients were specifically included. Four authors (two independently and two in concordance) assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using the Radiomic Quality Score (RQS). The overall score for each analyzed study was obtained by the sum of the single RQS items; the average and standard deviation values of the authors’ RQS were calculated and reported. Results. Eight included papers, presenting data on parotid glands, cochlea, masticatory muscles, and white brain matter, were specifically analyzed in this review. Only one study had an average RQS was≤30% (50%), while 3 studies obtained a RQS almost≤25%. Potential variability in the interpretations of specific RQS items could have influenced the inter-rater agreement in specific cases. Conclusions. Published radiomic studies provide encouraging but still limited and preliminary data that require further validation to improve the decision-making processes in preventing and managing radiation-induced toxicities.","Roberta Carbonara,Pierluigi Bonomo,Roberta Carbonara,Alessia Di Rito,Pierluigi Bonomo,Vittorio Didonna,Alessia Di Rito,Vittorio Didonna,Fabiana Gregucci,Vittorio Didonna,Maria Paola Ciliberti,Fabiana Gregucci,A.

10.1038/s41582-021-00510-y,34149051.0,,MRI biomarkers in neuro-oncology.,"The central role of MRI in neuro-oncology is undisputed. The technique is used, both in clinical practice and in clinical trials, to diagnose and monitor disease activity, support treatment decision-making, guide the use of focused treatments and determine response to treatment. Despite recent substantial advances in imaging technology and image analysis techniques, clinical MRI is still primarily used for the qualitative subjective interpretation of macrostructural features, as opposed to quantitative analyses that take into consideration multiple pathophysiological features. However, the field of quantitative imaging and imaging biomarker development is maturing. The European Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (EIBALL) and Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA) are setting standards for biomarker development, validation and implementation, as well as promoting the use of quantitative imaging and imaging biomarkers by demonstrating their clinical value. In parallel, advanced imaging techniques are reaching the clinical arena, providing quantitative, commonly physiological imaging parameters that are driving the discovery, validation and implementation of quantitative imaging and imaging biomarkers in the clinical routine. Additionally, computational analysis techniques are increasingly being used in the research setting to convert medical images into objective high-dimensional data and define radiomic signatures of disease states. Here, I review the definition and current state of MRI biomarkers in neuro-oncology, and discuss the clinical potential of quantitative image analysis techniques. MRI is an important tool in neuro-oncology but is still predominantly used in a qualitative manner.

METHODS This retrospective study included patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer from 2009 to 2015. Three radiologists independently segmented mesorectal fat on baseline T2-weighted axial MRI. Radiomics features were extracted from segmented volumes and calculated using CERR software, with adaptive synthetic sampling being employed to combat large class imbalances. Outcome variables included pathologic complete response (pCR), local recurrence, distant recurrence, clinical T-category (cT), post-treatment T category (ypT), and post-treatment N category (ypN). A maximum of eight most important features were selected for model development using support vector machines and fivefold cross-validation to predict each outcome parameter via elastic net regularization. Diagnostic metrics of the final models were calculated, including sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, and AUC. RESULTS The study included 236 patients (54 ± 12 years, 135 men). The AUC, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy for each clinical outcome were as follows: for pCR, 0.89, 78.0%, 85.1%, 52.5%, 94.9%, 83.9%; for local recurrence, 0.79, 68.3%, 80.7%, 46.7%, 91.2%, 78.3%; for distant recurrence, 0.87, 80.0%, 88.4%, 58.3%, 95.6%, 87.0%; for cT, 0.80, 85.8%, 56.5%, 89.1%, 49.1%, 80.1%; for ypN, 0.74, 65.0%, 80.1%, 52.7%, 87.0%, 76.3%; and for ypT, 0.86, 81.3%, 84.2%, 96.4%, 46.4%, 81.8%. CONCLUSION Radiomics features of mesorectal fat can predict pathological complete response and local and distant recurrence, as well as post-treatment T and N categories.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This monocentric retrospective study included 75 TN female patients with MRI (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast enhancement images) performed before NAC. For each patient, the tumor(s) and the parenchyma were independently segmented and analyzed with radiomic analysis to extract shape, size, and texture features. Several sets of features were realized based on the 4 different sequence images. Performances of 4 classifiers (random forest, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine (SVM) with linear or quadratic kernel) were compared based on pathological complete response (defined on the excised tissues), on 100 draws with 75% as training set and 25% as test. RESULTS The combination of features extracted from different MR images improved the classifier performance (more precisely, the features from T1W, T2W and DWI). The SVM with quadratic kernel showed the best performance with a mean AUC of 0.83, a sensitivity of 0.85 and a specificity of 0.75 in the test set. CONCLUSION MRI-based radiomics may be relevant to predict NAC response in TN cancer.

10.1109/jbhi.2021.3095476,34236971.0,,Multimodal Disentangled Variational Autoencoder with Game Theoretic Interpretability for Glioma grading.,"Effective fusion of multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is of great significance to boost the accuracy of glioma grading thanks to the complementary information provided by different imaging modalities. However, how to extract the common and distinctive information from MRI to achieve complementarity is still an open problem in information fusion research. In this study, we propose a deep neural network model termed as multimodal disentangled variational autoencoder (MMD-VAE) for glioma grading based on radiomics features extracted from preoperative multimodal MRI images. Specifically, the radiomics features are quantized and extracted from the region of interest for each modality. Then, the latent representations of variational autoencoder for these features are disentangled into common and distinctive representations to obtain the shared and complementary data among modalities. Afterward, cross-modality reconstruction loss and common-distinctive loss are designed to ensure the effectiveness of the disentangled representations. Finally, the disentangled common and distinctive representations are fused to predict the glioma grades, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is adopted to quantitatively interpret and analyze the contribution of the important features to grading. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MMD-VAE model achieves encouraging predictive performance (AUC:0.9939) on a public dataset, and good generalization performance (AUC:0.9611) on a cross-institutional private dataset. These quantitative results and interpretations may help radiologists understand gliomas better and make better treatment decisions for improving clinical outcomes.","Jianhong Cheng,Jianhong Cheng,Min Gao,Min Gao,Jin Liu,Jin Liu,Hailin Yue,Jin Liu,Hulin Kuang,Hailin Yue,Hulin Kuang,Jun Li,Jianxin Wang,Jun Liu,Jun Liu,Jianxin Wang",IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,2021.0

Materials and methods  Contrast enhanced venous phase CT images of 163 patients with pathological diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma (n = 125), gastric lymphoma (n = 12) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (n = 26) were retrospectively analyzed. Pixel size adjustment, gray-level discretization and gray-level normalization procedures were applied as pre-processing steps. Region of interest (ROI) was determined from the axial slice that represented the largest lesion area and a total of 40 texture features were calculated for each patient. Texture features were compared between the tumor subtypes and between adenocarcinoma grades. Statistically significant texture features were combined into a single parameter by logistic regression analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of these features and the combined parameter were measured to differentiate tumor subtypes by receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis.  Results  Classifications between adenocarcinoma versus lymphoma, adenocarcinoma vs. gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and well-differentiated adenocarcinoma versus poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma using texture features yielded successful results with high sensitivity (98, 91, 96%, respectively) and specificity (75, 77, 80%, respectively).

Methods: The local responses of 98 patients were categorized into two groups (complete response and noncomplete response). We performed a radiomics analysis using five segmentations created on FDG PET images, resulting in 4250 features per patient. To construct a machine learning model, we used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to extract radiomics features optimal for the prediction. Then, a prediction model was constructed by using a neural network classifier. The training model was evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation. Results: By the LASSO analysis of the training data, 22 radiomics features were extracted. In the testing data, the average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score of the five prediction models were 89.6%, 92.7%, 89.5%, and 0.95, respectively.

DL models were developed and tested to classify the early- and advanced-stage using training (n = 58), validation (n = 7), and testing (n = 17) cohorts obtained from public domains. The network consists of three parts of encoder, decoder, and classification layer. Encoder and decoder layers are trained to reconstruct original images. Classification layers are trained to classify early- and advanced-stage NSCLC patients with a dense layer. Other machine learning-based approaches were compared.

10.3389/fonc.2021.646190,,,Predictive Radiomic Models for the Chemotherapy Response in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer based on Computerized-Tomography Images.,"The heterogeneity and complexity of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors mean that NSCLC patients at the same stage can have different chemotherapy prognoses. Accurate predictive models could recognize NSCLC patients likely to respond to chemotherapy so that they can be given personalized and effective treatment. We propose to identify predictive imaging biomarkers from pre-treatment CT images and construct a radiomic model that can predict the chemotherapy response in NSCLC. This single-center cohort study included 280 NSCLC patients who received first-line chemotherapy treatment. Non-contrast CT images were taken before and after the chemotherapy, and clinical information were collected. Based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and clinical criteria, the responses were classified into two categories: response (n = 145) and progression (n = 135), then all data were divided into two cohorts: training cohort (224 patients) and independent test cohort (56 patients). In total, 1629 features characterizing the tumor phenotype were extracted from a cube containing the tumor lesion cropped from the pre-chemotherapy CT images. After dimensionality reduction, predictive models of the chemotherapy response of NSCLC with different feature selection methods and different machine-learning classifiers (support vector machine, random forest, and logistic regression) were constructed. For the independent test cohort, the predictive model based on a random-forest classifier with 20 radiomic features achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of 85.7% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.941 (95% confidence interval, 0.898-0.982). Of the 20 selected features, four were first-order statistics of image intensity and the others were texture features. For nine features, there were significant differences between the response and progression groups (p < 0.001). In the response group, three features, indicating heterogeneity, were overrepresented and one feature indicating homogeneity was underrepresented. The proposed radiomic model with pre-chemotherapy CT features can predict the chemotherapy response of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. This radiomic model can help to stratify patients with NSCLC, thereby offering the prospect of better treatment.","Runsheng Chang,Shouliang Qi,Runsheng Chang,Yong Yue,Shouliang Qi,Yong Yue,Xiaoye Zhang,Xiaoye Zhang,Jiangdian Song,Jiangdian Song,Jiangdian Song,Jiangdian Song,Wei Qian,Wei Qian",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0

To address issues due to the invasiveness of clinical preoperative evaluation of microsatellite status, we investigated the value of preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics with machine learning for predicting the microsatellite status of colorectal cancer patients. Methods: 173 patients that underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT scans before operations were retrospectively analyzed in this study. The microsatellite status for each patient was identified as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or microsatellite stable (MSS), according to the test for mismatch repair gene proteins with immunohistochemical staining methods. There were 2492 radiomic features in total extracted from 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging. Then, radiomic features were selected through multivariate random forest selection and univariate relevancy tests after handling the imbalanced dataset through the random under-sampling method. Based on the selected features, we constructed a BalancedBagging model based on Adaboost classifiers to identify the MSI status in patients with CRC. The model performance was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy on the validation dataset. Results: The ensemble model was constructed based on two radiomic features and achieved an 82.8% AUC for predicting the MSI status of colorectal cancer patients. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 83.3%, 76.3%, and 76.8%, respectively. The significant correlation of the selected two radiomic features with multiple effective clinical features was identified (p < 0.05).

10.1038/s42256-021-00377-0,,,Radiological tumour classification across imaging modality and histology,"Radiomics refers to the high-throughput extraction of quantitative features from radiological scans and is widely used to search for imaging biomarkers for the prediction of clinical outcomes. Current radiomic signatures suffer from limited reproducibility and generalizability, because most features are dependent on imaging modality and tumour histology, making them sensitive to variations in scan protocol. Here, we propose novel radiological features that are specially designed to ensure compatibility across diverse tissues and imaging contrast. These features provide systematic characterization of tumour morphology and spatial heterogeneity. In an international multi-institution study of 1,682 patients, we discover and validate four unifying imaging subtypes across three malignancies and two major imaging modalities. These tumour subtypes demonstrate distinct molecular characteristics and prognoses after conventional therapies. In advanced lung cancer treated with immunotherapy, one subtype is associated with improved survival and increased tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes compared with the others. Deep learning enables automatic tumour segmentation and reproducible subtype identification, which can facilitate practical implementation. The unifying radiological tumour classification may inform prognosis and treatment response for precision medicine. Radiomics has been used to discover imaging signatures that predict therapy response and outcomes, but clinical translation has been slow. Using machine learning methods, the authors report tumour subtypes that are applicable across major imaging modalities and three cancer types. The tumour subtypes have distinct radiological and molecular features, as well as survival outcomes after conventional therapies.","Jia Wu,Chao Li,Jia Wu,Jia Wu,Michael F.

Material: A group of 301 NSCLC patients were retrospectively reviewed. The EGFR mutation status was determined by ARMS PCR analysis. All patients underwent nonenhanced CT before surgery. Radiomic features were extracted (GE healthcare). The maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) and LASSO, were used to select features. We incorporated the independent clinical features into the radiomic feature model and formed a joint model (i.e., the radiomic feature-based nomogram). The performance of the joint model was compared with that of the other two models. Results: In total, 396 radiomic features were extracted. A radiomic signature model comprising 9 selected features was established for discriminating patients with EGFR-activating mutations from wild-type EGFR. The radiomic score (Radscore) in the two groups was significantly different between patients with wild-type EGFR and EGFR-activating mutations (training cohort: P<0.0001; validation cohort: P=0.0061).

Compared to the radiomic feature model alone, the nomogram incorporating the clinical features and Radscore exhibited improved sensitivity and discrimination for predicting EGFR-activating mutations (sensitivity: training cohort: 0.84, validation cohort: 0.76; AUC: training cohort: 0.81, validation cohort: 0.75). Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the nomogram was clinically useful and surpassed traditional clinical and radiomic features. Conclusions: The joint model showed favourable performance in the individualized, noninvasive prediction of EGFR-activating mutations in NSCLC patients.","Qiaoyou Weng,Qiaoyou Weng,Hui Jing,Qiaoyou Weng,Junguo Hui,Hailin Wang,Chuanqiang Lan,Wang Hailin,Jiansheng Huang,Chuanqiang Lan,Jiansheng Huang,Chun Zhang,Zheng Lu,Chun Zhao,Shiji Fang,Liyun Zheng,Liyun Zheng,Minjiang Chen,Shiji Fang,Lu Chen,Minjiang Chen,Minjiang Chen,Chenying Lu,Yu Bao,Chenying Lu,Yuyan Bao,Peipei Pang,Min Xu,Peipei Pang,Min Xu,Weijian Mao,Weibo Mao,Zufei Wang,Weibo Mao,Zufei Wang,Jianfei Tu,Jianfei Tu,Yuan Huang,Jianfei Tu,Yuan Huang,Yuan Huang,Jiansong Ji,Jiansong Ji,Jiansong Ji",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0

This prospective study examined 291 invasive cancers in 288 patients who underwent breast MRI at 3 T before treatment between May 2017 and July 2019. Texture and perfusion analyses were performed and a total of 160 parameters for each cancer were extracted. Relationships between MRI parameters and prognostic biomarkers were analyzed using five machine learning algorithms. Each model was built using only texture features, only perfusion features, or both. Model performance was compared using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the DeLong method, and the importance of MRI parameters in prediction was derived. Texture parameters were associated with the status of hormone receptors, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and Ki67, tumor size, grade, and molecular subtypes (p < 0.002). Perfusion parameters were associated with the status of hormone receptors and Ki67, grade, and molecular subtypes (p < 0.003). The random forest model integrating texture and perfusion parameters showed the highest performance (AUC = 0.75). The performance of the random forest model was the best with a special scale filter of 0 (AUC = 0.80). The important parameters for prediction were texture irregularity (entropy) and relative extracellular extravascular space (Ve). Radiomic machine learning that integrates tumor heterogeneity and angiogenesis properties on MRI has the potential to noninvasively predict prognostic factors of breast cancer. • Machine learning, integrating tumor heterogeneity and angiogenesis properties on MRI, can be applied to predict prognostic biomarkers and molecular subtypes in breast cancer. • The random forest model showed the best predictive performance among the five machine learning models (logistic regression, decision tree, naive Bayes, random forest, and artificial neural network). • The most important MRI parameters for predicting prognostic factors in breast cancer were texture irregularity (entropy) among texture parameters and relative extracellular extravascular space (Ve) among perfusion parameters.","Ji Young Lee,Ji Young Lee,Kwang-Sig Lee,Bo Kyoung Seo,Kwang-Sig Lee,Bo Kyoung Seo,Kyu Ran Cho,Ok Hee Woo,Kyu Ran Cho,Sung Eun Song,Ok Hee Woo,Sung Eun Song,Min Jung Kim,Eun Kyung Kim,Hye Yoon Lee,Jung Sun Kim,Hye Yoon Lee,Jung Sun Kim,Jaehyung Cha,Jaehyung Cha,Jaehyung Cha",European Radiology,2021.0
10.1259/bjro.20200073,,,Radiomics AI prediction for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) prognosis and recurrence with target volume approach.,"Objectives To evaluate the performance of radiomics features extracted from planning target volume (PTV) and gross tumor volume (GTV) in the prediction of the death prognosis and cancer recurrence rate for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Methods 188 HNSCC patients' planning CT images with radiotherapy structures sets were acquired from Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The 3D slicer (v. 4.10.2) with the PyRadiomics extension (Computational Imaging and Bioinformatics Lab, Harvard medical School) was used to extract radiomics features from the radiotherapy planning images. An in-house developed deep learning artificial neural networks (DL-ANN) model was used to predict death prognosis and cancer recurrence rate based on the features extracted from GTV and PTV of the CT images. Results The PTV radiomics features with DL-ANN model could achieve 77.7% accuracy with overall AUC equal to 0.934 and 0.932 when predicting HNSCC-related death prognosis and cancer recurrence respectively. Furthermore, the DL-ANN model can achieve an accuracy of 74.3% with AUC equal to 0.947 and 0.956 for the HNSCC-related death prognosis and cancer recurrence respectively using GTV features. Conclusion Using both GTV and PTV radiomics features in the DL-ANN model, can aid in predicting HNSCC-related death prognosis and cancer recurrence. Clinicians may find it helpful in formulating different treatment regimens and facilitate personized medicine based on the predicted outcome when performing GTV and PTV delineation. Advances in knowledge Radiomics features of GTV and PTV are reliable prognosis and recurrence predicting tools, which may help clinicians in GTV and PTV delineation to facilitate delivery of personalized treatment.","Tang Fh,Tang Fh,Chu Cyw,Tang Fh,Chu Cyw,Eva Y.W.

10.3390/diagnostics11061011,,,Radiomics Score Combined with ACR TI-RADS in Discriminating Benign and Malignant Thyroid Nodules Based on Ultrasound Images: A Retrospective Study.,"This study aimed to explore the ability of combination model of ultrasound radiomics score (Rad-score) and the thyroid imaging, reporting and data system by the American College of Radiology (ACR TI-RADS) in predicting benign and malignant thyroid nodules (TNs). Up to 286 radiomics features were extracted from ultrasound images of TNs. By using the lowest probability of classification error and average correlation coefficients (POE + ACC) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), we finally selected four features to establish Rad-score (Vertl-RLNonUni, Vertl-GLevNonU, WavEnLH-s4 and WavEnHL-s5). DeLong’s test and decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that the method of combining Rad-score and ACR TI-RADS had the best performance (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC = 0.913 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.881–0.939) and 0.899 (95%CI, 0.840–0.942) in the training group and verification group, respectively), followed by ACR TI-RADS (AUC = 0.898 (95%CI, 0.863–0.926) and 0.870 (95%CI, 0.806–0.919) in the training group and verification group, respectively), and followed by Rad-score (AUC = 0.750 (95%CI, 0.704–0.792) and 0.750 (95%CI, 0.672–0.817) in the training group and verification group, respectively). We concluded that the ability of ultrasound Rad-score to distinguish benign and malignant TNs was not as good as that of ACR TI-RADS, and the ability of the combination model of Rad-score and ACR TI-RADS to discriminate benign and malignant TNs was better than ACR TI-RADS or Rad-score alone. Ultrasound Rad-score might play a potential role in improving the differentiation of malignant TNs from benign TNs.","Peng Luo,Fang Zheng,Peng Luo,Ping Zhang,Zheng Fang,Ping Zhang,Yang Yang,Hua Zhang,Yang Yang,Hua Zhang,Hua Zhang,Lei Su,Lei Su,Zhigang Wang,Lei Su,Wang Zhigang,Jianli Ren,Zhigang Wang,Jianli Ren,Jianli Ren",,2021.0
10.21037/qims-21-86,,,Radiomics feature reliability assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient: a systematic review,"Radiomics research is rapidly growing in recent years, but more concerns on radiomics reliability are also raised. This review attempts to update and overview the current status of radiomics reliability research in the ever expanding medical literature from the perspective of a single reliability metric of intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). To conduct this systematic review, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. After literature search and selection, a total of 481 radiomics studies using CT, PET, or MRI, covering a wide range of subject and disease types, were included for review. In these highly heterogeneous studies, feature reliability to image segmentation was much more investigated than reliability to other factors, such as image acquisition, reconstruction, post-processing, and feature quantification. The reported ICCs also suggested high radiomics feature reliability to image segmentation. Image acquisition was found to introduce much more feature variability than image segmentation, in particular for MRI, based on the reported ICC values. Image post-processing and feature quantification yielded different levels of radiomics reliability and might be used to mitigate image acquisition-induced variability. Some common flaws and pitfalls in ICC use were identified, and suggestions on better ICC use were given. Due to the extremely high study heterogeneities and possible risks of bias, the degree of radiomics feature reliability that has been achieved could not yet be safely synthesized or derived in this review. More future researches on radiomics reliability are warranted.","Cindy Xue,Cindy Xue,Jing Yuan,Gladys Lo,Jing Yuan,Gladys Gloh Lo,Artemis Chang,Gladys Lo,Amy T. Y. Chang,Darren M.C. Poon,Darren M.C.

A total of 190 cases with RCC confirmed by pathology were retrospectively analyzed, with the patients being randomly divided into two groups, including the training set and testing set according to the ratio of 7:3. A total of 396 radiomic features were computationally obtained and analyzed with the Correlation between features, Univariate Logistics and Multivariate Logistics. Finally, 4 features were selected, and three machine models (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR)) were established to discriminate RCC subtypes. The radiomics performance was compared with that of radiologist diagnosis. In the testing set, the RF model had an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.909, a sensitivity of 0.956, and a specificity of 0.538. The SVM model had an AUC value of 0.841, a sensitivity of 1.0, and a specificity of 0.231, in the testing set. The LR model had an AUC value of 0.906, a sensitivity of 0.956, and a specificity of 0.692, in the testing set. The sensitivity and specificity of radiologist diagnosis to differentiate ccRCC from non-ccRCC were 0.850 and 0.581, respectively, with the AUC value of the radiologist diagnosis as 0.69.

Skin biopsy as the gold standard causes ulceration, bleeding, or infection. This study aimed to develop radiomic methods using CT as a noninvasive method for calciphylaxis diagnosis. The confirmed calciphylaxis patients (Group I), pathologically confirmed non-calciphylaxis patients (Group II), and CKD patients (Group III) from October 1, 2017, to November 30, 2019, were enrolled. Training: 70% of patients of Group I and all Group III. Test: 30% of patients of Group I and all Group II. ROI was set at the skin lesion including the soft tissue. First-order and texture features were extracted from each lesion unit. CT-based radiomic models were on the basis of logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM). Additionally, model performance was evaluated in the test dataset and compared with the plain radiography and bone scintigraphy. In total, 124 lesions and 38 lesions were identified in training and test datasets. Radiomic models were effective in detecting calciphylaxis in patients with CKD, with AUCs of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.924-0.953) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.921-0.953) (SVM and LR) in test. The SVM model manifested a sensitivity and specificity of 0.89 and 0.8, and 0.78 and 0.90, at high-sensitivity and high-specificity operating points, respectively. Similar performance was found in the LR model. Radiomic models were more effective than plain radiography and bone scintigraphy (Delong test, P<0.05). Verification studies showed the features which manifested the real variability of lesions. In this research, it primarily developed a radiomic method for noninvasive detection of calciphylaxis in patients with CKD.

Precise diagnosis of tumor phenotypes and recurrence risk is of vital importance in the clinical management of BCa. Although imaging modalities such as CT and multiparametric MRI have played an essential role in the noninvasive diagnosis and prognosis of BCa, radiomics has also shown great potential in the precise diagnosis of BCa and preoperative prediction of the recurrence risk. Radiomics-empowered image interpretation can amplify the differences in tumor heterogeneity between different phenotypes, i.e., high-grade vs. low-grade, early-stage vs. advanced-stage, and nonmuscle-invasive vs. muscle-invasive. With a multimodal radiomics strategy, the recurrence risk of BCa can be preoperatively predicted, providing critical information for the clinical decision making. We thus reviewed the rapid progress in the field of medical imaging empowered by the radiomics for decoding the phenotype and recurrence risk of BCa during the past 20 years, summarizing the entire pipeline of the radiomics strategy for the definition of BCa phenotype and recurrence risk including region of interest definition, radiomics feature extraction, tumor phenotype prediction and recurrence risk stratification. We particularly focus on current pitfalls, challenges and opportunities to promote massive clinical applications of radiomics pipeline in the near future.","Xiaopan Xu,Xiaopan Xu,Huanjun Wang,Huanjun Wang,Huanjun Wang,Yan Guo,Xi Zhang,Yan Guo,Yan Guo,Baojuan Li,Xi Zhang,Peng Du,Baojuan Li,Baojuan Li,Yang Liu,Peng Du,Hongbing Lu,Yang Liu,Hongbing Lu",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0

10.3390/diagnostics11071296,,,The Influence of the Exclusion of Central Necrosis on [18F]FDG PET Radiomic Analysis,"Background: Central necrosis can be detected on [18F]FDG PET/CT as a region with little to no tracer uptake. Currently, there is no consensus regarding the inclusion of regions of central necrosis during volume of interest (VOI) delineation for radiomic analysis. The aim of this study was to assess how central necrosis affects radiomic analysis in PET. Methods: Forty-three patients, either with non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC, n = 12) or with pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas (PPGL, n = 31), were included retrospectively. VOIs were delineated with and without central necrosis. From all VOIs, 105 radiomic features were extracted. Differences in radiomic features between delineation methods were assessed using a paired t-test with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction. In the PPGL cohort, performances of the radiomic models to predict the noradrenergic biochemical profile were assessed by comparing the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for both delineation methods. Results: At least 65% of the features showed significant differences between VOIvital-tumour and VOIgross-tumour (65%, 79% and 82% for the NSCLC, PPGL and combined cohort, respectively). The AUCs of the radiomic models were not significantly different between delineation methods. Conclusion: In both tumour types, almost two-third of the features were affected, demonstrating that the impact of whether or not to include central necrosis in the VOI on the radiomic feature values is significant. Nevertheless, predictive performances of both delineation methods were comparable. We recommend that radiomic studies should report whether or not central necrosis was included during delineation.","Wyanne A. Noortman,Wyanne A.

Materials and Methods Preoperative contrast enhanced abdominal CT scan of ccRCC patients along with pathological grade/stage, gene mutation status, and survival outcomes were retrieved from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) /The Cancer Genome Atlas - Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-KIRC) database, a publicly available dataset. A semi-automatic segmentation method was applied to segment ccRCC tumors, and 1160 radiomics features were extracted from each segmented tumor on the CT images. Non-parametric principal component decomposition (PCD) and unsupervised hierarchical clustering were applied to build the radiomics signature models. The factors confounding the radiomics signature were investigated and controlled sequentially. Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox regression analyses were performed to test the association between radiomics signatures and survival outcomes. Results 183 patients of TCGA-KIRC cohort with available imaging, pathological, and clinical outcomes were included in this study. All 1160 radiomics features were included in the first radiomics signature. Three additional radiomics signatures were then modelled in successive steps removing redundant radiomics features first, removing radiomics features biased by CT slice thickness second, and removing radiomics features dependent on tumor size third. The final radiomics signature model was the most parsimonious, unbiased by CT slice thickness, and independent of tumor size. This final radiomics signature stratified the cohort into radiomics phenotypes that are different by cancer-specific and recurrence-free survival; HR (95% CI) = 3.0 (1.5-5.7), p < 0.05 and HR (95% CI) = 6.6 (3.1-14.1), p < 0.05, respectively. Conclusion Radiomics signature can be confounded by multiple factors, including feature redundancy, image acquisition parameters like slice thickness, and tumor size. Attention to and proper control for these potential confounders are necessary for a reliable and clinically valuable radiomics signature.","Lin Lü,Lin Lu,Firas S. Ahmed,Lin Lu,Oğuz Akın,Firas S.

Images were acquired using an 8-channel breast coil in the axial plane. The rationale behind this study is to show the feasibility of a radiomics-powered model that could be integrated into the clinical practice by exploiting only standard-of-care DCE-MRI with the goal of reducing the required image pre-processing (ie, normalization and quantitative imaging map generation). MATERIALS AND METHODS 107 radiomic features were extracted from a manually annotated dataset of 111 patients, which was split into discovery and test sets. A feature calibration and pre-processing step was performed to find only robust non-redundant features. An in-depth discovery analysis was performed to define a predictive model: for this purpose, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was trained in a nested 5-fold cross-validation scheme, by exploiting several unsupervised feature selection methods. The predictive model performance was evaluated in terms of Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC), specificity, sensitivity, PPV and NPV. The test was performed on unseen held-out data. RESULTS The model combining Unsupervised Discriminative Feature Selection (UDFS) and SVMs on average achieved the best performance on the blinded test set: AUROC=0.725±0.091, sensitivity=0.709±0.176, specificity=0.741±0.114, PPV=0.72±0.093, and NPV=0.75±0.114.

10.2139/ssrn.3900665,,,A Deep Learning System for Classifying T Stage and Predicting Prognosis of Colorectal Cancer via Preoperative Computed Tomography Images,"Background: Preoperative evaluation of the T stage and prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) is vital for patients' management. Some of the known limitations of conventional computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of CRC needs to be resolved. Therefore, a deep learning system was developed by using patients' preoperative CT images to classify T stage and predict prognosis of CRC. Methods: Resnet50 (R), Inception-V3 (I), and Efficientnet-B5 (E) were adopted as the base model, and the three base model accepted CT images as multi-model image inputs and the output probabilities of the three networks were averaged to form an colorectal cancer ensemble model (CRCEM). This deep learning system was developed based on preoperative CT images of 654 patients (training cohort, n=393; validation cohort, n=131; test cohort, n=130). The performance of classifying T stage was assessed by our model, such as CRCEM (T1-2, T3, T4), CRCEM (T1-2, T3-4), and CRCEM (T1-3, T4). Then an observed study was conducted to evaluate our scheme performance in classifying T stage with two experienced radiologists. Furthermore, the output images of T stage were used as input and determined whether the tumor in the input CT images had a good or poor prognosis by using selected 284 patients (training cohort, n=228; test cohort, n=56), and this model was named as CRCEM (prognosis). Findings: Area under the curve (AUC) of classifying T stage in CRCEM (T1-2, T3, T4), CECEM (T1-2, T3-4), and CRCEM (T1-3, T4) was 0.859, 0.925, and 0.958, respectively. The AUC of classifying T1-2 vs. T3-4 was 0.749 and 0.763 in radiologist 1 and radiologist 2, respectively, and the AUC of classifying T1-3 vs. T4 was 0.774 and 0.765 in radiologist 1 and radiologist 2, respectively. Kappa value for inter-radiologist agreement was 0.792, (P<0.001). Meanwhile, AUC in classifying prognosis of CRC was 0.872. Interpretation: This study suggested that an effective method for classifying T stage and prognosis had been developed based on preoperative CT images, and held great potential for precise treatment of CRC.

10.2147/ott.s316994,34611410.0,,A Radiomic Approach to Access Tumor Immune Status by CD8+TRMs on Surgically Resected Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.,"Purpose Immunotherapy has made breakthroughs in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, only a subset of patients achieved long-term survival, so it is of great importance to find a biomarker of lung cancer thus guide immunotherapy. Studies have shown that the infiltration level of tissue resident memory CD8+ T cells (CD8+ TRMs) is positively correlated with lung cancer prognosis and can be an ideal biomarker for assessing the tumor local immune status. We screened the radiomic features associated with CD8+ TRMs as targets in NSCLC surgical specimens by radiomic approaches, and established a radiomic predictive model to assess the local immune status, which may provide a scientific reference for lung cancer treatment strategies. Patients and Methods We retrospectively analyzed the NSCLC surgical specimens immune cell database and extracted CD8+ TRMs cell data, preoperative CT scan data were achieved. A total of 97 patients containing complete preoperative data were included, radiomic features were extracted from the preoperative CT image data. All the patients were divided into two groups, namely high-CD8+ TRMs infiltrated group and low-CD8+ TRMs infiltrated group, based on the proportion of CD8+ TRMs cells subset in the immune cell population. The most valuable radiomic features and semantic features were extracted and selected, and a neural network model was established to predict the level of CD8+ TRMs cell infiltration level to assess the tumor local immune status. Results The NSCLC tumor immune status predictive model was built to discriminate high- from low-CD8+ TRMs with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.788 (95% CI) in the training set and 0.753 (95% CI) in the validation set. Conclusion The radiomic models using CT image data showed a good predictive performance for accessing NSCLC immune status thus has great potential for personalized therapeutic decision making.","Jie Min,Fei Dong,Jie Min,Fei Dong,Pin Wu,Pin Wu,Xiaopei Xu,Xiao-Pei Xu,Yimin Wu,Yimin Wu,Yinuo Tan,Fan Yang,Yanbin Tan,Fan Yang,Ying Chai,Fan Yang,Ying Chai",OncoTargets and Therapy,2021.0
10.3389/fmolb.2021.662366,,,A Radiomics Signature-Based Nomogram to Predict the Progression-Free Survival of Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization Plus Radiofrequency Ablation.,"Objective The study aimed to establish and evaluate an MRI-based radiomics signature-based nomogram for predicting the progression-free survival (PFS) of intermediate and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Materials and Methods 113 intermediate and advanced HCC patients treated with TACE and RFA were eligible for this study. Patients were classified into a training cohort (n=78 cases) and a validation cohort (n=35 cases). Radiomics features were extracted from T1WI images. Dimension reduction was conducted to select optimal features using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). A Rad-score was calculated and used to classify the patients into high-risk and low-risk groups and further integrated into multivariate Cox analysis. Three prediction models and a nomogram were established, and the area under the curve (AUC) of operating characteristics, the concordance index (C-index), a calibration curve, a decision curve and a clinical impact curve were determined to verify their accuracy. Results The AUC of the radiomics signature-based model for PFS in the training cohort was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.93) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.96) in the validation cohort. The median PFS of the low-risk group (30.4 (95% CI: 19.41-41.38)) was higher than that of the high-risk group (8.1 (95% CI: 4.41-11.79)) in the training cohort (log rank test, z=16.58, P<0.001) and was verified in the validation cohort. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that BCLC stage, AFP level, time interval and radiomics signatures were independent prognostic factors of PFS in the training cohort. The AUC of the clinical model based on clinical factors for PFS in the training cohort was 0.838 (95% CI: 0.731-0.946) and 0.830 (95% CI: 0.669-0.990) in the validation cohort. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.722 (95% CI: 0.657-0.786) in the training cohort and 0.821 (95% CI: 0.726-0.915) in the validation cohort. The calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact curve showed that the nomogram can be used to accurately predict the PFS of patients. Conclusion A nomogram combining radiomics and clinical factors accurately predicted the PFS of intermediate and advanced HCC treated with TACE plus RFA.","Shiji Fang,Shiji Fang,Linqiang Lai,Shiji Fang,Linqiang Lai,Jinyu Zhu,Jinyu Zhu,Zheng Lu,Liyun Zheng,Liyun Zheng,Yuanyuan Xu,Yuanyuan Xu,Weiqian Chen,Weiqian Chen,Fazong Wu,Fazong Wu,Fazong Wu,Xia Wu,Minjiang Chen,Xulu Wu,Xulu Wu,Qiaoyou Weng,Minjiang Chen,Jiansong Ji,Qiaoyou Weng,Zhongwei Zhao,Zhongwei Zhao,Jiansong Ji,Zhongwei Zhao,Jianfei Tu,Jianfei Tu,Jianfei Tu",Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences,2021.0

10.3389/fonc.2021.721591,,,Analysis of EPID Transmission Fluence Maps Using Machine Learning Models and CNN for Identifying Position Errors in the Treatment of GO Patients.,"Purpose: To find a suitable method for analyzing electronic portal imaging device (EPID) transmission fluence maps for the identification of position errors in the in vivo dose monitoring of patients with Graves’ ophthalmopathy (GO). Methods: Position errors combining 0-, 2-, and 4-mm errors in the left-right (LR), anterior-posterior (AP), and superior-inferior (SI) directions in the delivery of 40 GO patient radiotherapy plans to a human head phantom were simulated and EPID transmission fluence maps were acquired. Dose difference (DD) and structural similarity (SSIM) maps were calculated to quantify changes in the fluence maps. Three types of machine learning (ML) models that utilize radiomics features of the DD maps (ML 1 models), features of the SSIM maps (ML 2 models), and features of both DD and SSIM maps (ML 3 models) as inputs were used to perform three types of position error classification, namely a binary classification of the isocenter error (type 1), three binary classifications of LR, SI, and AP direction errors (type 2), and an eight-element classification of the combined LR, SI, and AP direction errors (type 3). Convolutional neural network (CNN) was also used to classify position errors using the DD and SSIM maps as input. Results: The best-performing ML 1 model was XGBoost, which achieved accuracies of 0.889, 0.755, 0.778, 0.833, and 0.532 in the type 1, type 2-LR, type 2-AP, type 2-SI, and type 3 classification, respectively. The best ML 2 model was XGBoost, which achieved accuracies of 0.856, 0.731, 0.736, 0.949, and 0.491, respectively. The best ML 3 model was linear discriminant classifier (LDC), which achieved accuracies of 0.903, 0.792, 0.870, 0.931, and 0.671, respectively. The CNN achieved classification accuracies of 0.925, 0.833, 0.875, 0.949, and 0.689, respectively. Conclusion: ML models and CNN using combined DD and SSIM maps can analyze EPID transmission fluence maps to identify position errors in the treatment of GO patients. Further studies with large sample sizes are needed to improve the accuracy of CNN.","Guyu Dai,Guyu Dai,Xiangbin Zhang,Xiangbin Zhang,Wenjie Liu,Liu Wenjie,Zhibin Li,Zhibin Li,Guangyu Wang,Yaxin Liu,Guangyu Wang,Qing Xiao,Yaxin Liu,Qing Xiao,Lian Duan,Duan Lian,Jing Li,Jing Li,Xinyu Song,Xinyu Song,Guangjun Li,Guangjun Li,Song Bai,Sen Bai",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0
10.21037/jtd-21-864,,,Artificial intelligence-assisted decision making for prognosis and drug efficacy prediction in lung cancer patients: a narrative review,"In this review, we aim to present frontier studies in patients with lung cancer as it related to artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted decision-making and summarize the latest advances, challenges and future trend in this field.Despite increasing survival rate in cancer patients over the last decades, lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The early diagnosis, accurate evaluation and individualized treatment are vital approaches to improve the survival rate of patients with lung cancer. Thus, decision making based on these approaches requires accuracy and efficiency beyond manpower. Recent advances in AI and precision medicine have provided a fertile environment for the development of AI-based models. These models have the potential to assist radiologists and oncologists in detecting lung cancer, predicting prognosis and developing personalized treatment plans for better outcomes of the patients.We searched literature from 2000 through July 31th, 2021 in Medline/PubMed, the Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, ACM Digital Library, INSPEC and EMBASE. Key words such as ""artificial intelligence"", ""AI"", ""deep learning"", ""lung cancer"", ""NSCLC"", ""SCLC"" were combined to identify related literatures. These literatures were then selected by two independent authors. Articles chosen by only one author will be examined by another author to determine whether this article was relative and valuable. The selected literatures were read by all authors and discussed to draw reliable conclusions.AI, especially for those based on deep learning and radiomics, is capable of assisting clinical decision making from many aspects, for its quantitatively interpretation of patients' information and its potential to deal with the dynamics, individual differences and heterogeneity of lung cancer.

However, diagnosis on radiological imaging is challenging. In this study, we developed a radiomics model based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to distinguish the most common malignant and benign primary solid liver lesions, and externally validated the model in two centers. Approach & Results: Datasets were retrospectively collected from three tertiary referral centers (A, B and C) including data from affiliated hospitals sent for revision. Patients with malignant (hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) and benign (hepatocellular adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia) lesions were included. For each patient, only a T2-weighted MRI was included. A radiomics model was developed on dataset A using a combination of machine learning approaches, and internally evaluated on dataset A through cross-validation. Next, the model was externally validated on datasets B and C, and compared to scoring by two experienced abdominal radiologists on dataset C. In the resulting dataset, in total, 486 patients were included (A: 187, B: 98 and C: 201). Despite substantial MRI acquisition heterogeneity, the radiomics model developed on dataset A had a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78 in the internal validation on dataset A, and a similar AUC in the external validations (B: 0.74, C: 0.76). In dataset C, the two radiologists showed moderate agreement (Cohens κ: 0.61) and achieved AUCs of 0.86 and 0.82, respectively.Conclusions: Our radiomics model using T2-weighted MRI only can non-invasively distinguish malignant from benign primary solid liver lesions. External validation indicated that our model is generalizable despite substantial differences in the acquisition protocols.","Martijn P.A. Starmans,Razvan L. Miclea,M. P. A.

10.1148/radiol.2021203281,34519578.0,,Biologic Pathways Underlying Prognostic Radiomics Phenotypes from Paired MRI and RNA Sequencing in Glioblastoma.,"Background The biologic meaning of prognostic radiomics phenotypes remains poorly understood, hampered in part by lack of multicenter reproducible evidence. Purpose To uncover the biologic meaning of individual prognostic radiomics phenotypes in glioblastomas using paired MRI and RNA sequencing data and to validate the reproducibility of the identified radiogenomics linkages externally. Materials and Methods This retrospective multicenter study included four data sets gathered between January 2015 and December 2016. From a radiomics analysis set, a 13-feature radiomics signature was built using preoperative MRI for overall survival prediction. Using a radiogenomics training set with both MRI and RNA sequencing, biologic pathways were enriched and correlated with each of the 13 radiomics phenotypes. Radiomics-correlated key genes were identified to derive a prognostic radiomics gene expression (RadGene) score. The reproducibility of identified pathways and genes was validated with an external test set and a public data set (The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA]). A log-rank test was performed to assess prognostic significance. Results A total of 435 patients (mean age, 55 years ± 15 [standard deviation]; 263 men) were enrolled. The radiomics signature was associated with overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 3.68; 95% CI: 2.08, 6.52; P < .001) in the radiomics validation subset. Four types of prognostic radiomics phenotypes were correlated with distinct pathways: immune, proliferative, treatment responsive, and cellular functions (false-discovery rate < 0.10). Thirty radiomics-correlated genes were identified. The prognostic significance of the RadGene score was confirmed in an external test set (HR, 2.02; 95% CI: 1.19, 3.41; P = .01) and a TCGA test set (HR, 1.43; 95% CI: 1.001, 2.04; P = .048). The radiomics-associated pathways and key genes can be replicated in an external test set. Conclusion Individual radiomics phenotypes on MRI scans predictive of overall survival were driven by distinct key pathways involved in immune regulation, tumor proliferation, treatment responses, and cellular functions in glioblastoma, which could be reproduced externally. © RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.","Qinjun Sun,Qiuchang Sun,Yinsheng Chen,Yinsheng Chen,Chaofeng Liang,Yuanshen Zhao,Chaofeng Liang,Yuanshen Zhao,Yuanshen Zhao,Xiaofei Lv,Xiaofei Lv,Yan Zou,Kai Yan,Yan Zou,Hairong Zheng,Kai Yan,Dong Liang,Hairong Zheng,Dong Liang,Liang Dong,Zhicheng Li,Zhicheng Li",Radiology,2021.0

Purpose To investigate whether tumor-related and perivascular CT radiomic features improve preoperative assessment of arterial involvement in patients with surgically proven PDAC. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive patients with PDAC who underwent surgery after preoperative CT between 2012 and 2019. A three-dimensional segmentation of PDAC and perivascular tissue surrounding the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was performed on preoperative CT images with radiomic features extracted to characterize morphology, intensity, texture, and task-based spatial information. The reference standard was the pathologic SMA margin status of the surgical sample: SMA involved (tumor cells ≤1 mm from margin) versus SMA not involved (tumor cells >1 mm from margin). The preoperative assessment of SMA involvement by a fellowship-trained radiologist in multidisciplinary consensus was the comparison. High reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.7) and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were used to select features included in the logistic regression model. Results A total of 194 patients (median age, 66 years; interquartile range, 60-71 years; age range, 36-85 years; 99 men) were evaluated. Aside from surgery, 148 patients underwent neoadjuvant therapy. A total of 141 patients' samples did not involve SMA, whereas 53 involved SMA. A total of 1695 CT radiomic features were extracted. The model with five features (maximum hugging angle, maximum diameter, logarithm robust mean absolute deviation, minimum distance, square gray level co-occurrence matrix correlation) showed a better performance compared with the radiologist assessment (model vs radiologist area under the curve, 0.71 [95% CI: 0.62, 0.79] vs 0.54 [95% CI: 0.50, 0.59]; P < .001). The model showed a sensitivity of 62% (33 of 53 patients) (95% CI: 51, 77) and a specificity of 77% (108 of 141 patients) (95% CI: 60, 84).

METHOD PubMed, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection were searched for relevant studies. The studies differentiating IAC from indolent lung adenocarcinomas appearing as GGNs based on CT radiomics features were included. Basic information, patient information, CT-scanner information, technique information and performance information were extracted for each included study. The quality of each study was assessed using the Radiomic Quality Score (RQS) and the Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). RESULTS Twenty-eight studies were included with patients ranging from 34 to 794. All of them were retrospective. Patients in three studies were from multiple centers. Most studies segmented regions of interest manually. Pyradiomics and AK software were the most frequently used for features extraction. The number of radiomics features extracted varied from 7 to 10329. Logistic regression was the most frequently chosen model. Entropy was identified as radiomics signature in seven studies. The AUC of included studies ranged from 0.77 to 0.98 in 15 validation sets. The percentage RQS ranged from 3% to 50%. According to PROBAST, the overall risk of bias (ROB) was high in 89.3% (25/28) of included studies, unclear in 7.1% (2/28) of included studies, and low in 3.6% (1/28) of included studies. All studies were low concern regarding the applicability of primary studies to the review question. CONCLUSION CT radiomics-based model is promising and encouraging in differentiating IAC from indolent lung adenocarcinomas, though they require methodological rigor. Well-designed studies are necessary to demonstrate their validity and standardization of methods and results can prompt their use in daily clinical practice.","Lili Shi,Jing Zhao,Lili Shi,Jinli Zhao,Xueqing Peng,Xueqing Peng,Yunpeng Wang,Yunpeng Wang,Lei Liu,Meihong Sheng,Lei Liu,Lei Liu,Meihong Sheng,Meihong Sheng",European Journal of Radiology,2021.0
10.1002/mp.15195,34455593.0,,Challenges in ensuring the generalizability of image quantitation methods for MRI,"Image quantitation methods including quantitative MRI, multiparametric MRI, and radiomics, offer great promise for clinical use. However, many of these methods have limited clinical adoption, in part due to issues of generalizability, i.e., the ability to translate methods and models across institutions. Researchers can assess generalizability through measurement of repeatability and reproducibility, thus quantifying different aspects of measurement variance. In this article, we review the challenges to ensuring repeatability and reproducibility of image quantitation methods as well as present strategies to minimize their variance to enable wider clinical implementation. We present possible solutions for achieving clinically acceptable performance of image quantitation methods and briefly discuss the impact of minimizing variance and achieving generalizability towards clinical implementation and adoption.

METHODS In total, 282 patients who underwent MRI and resection for STS at three independent centers were retrospectively enrolled. In addition, 113 of the 282 patients received additional contrast-enhanced MRI scans. We separated the participants into a development cohort and an external test cohort. The development cohort consisted of patients from one center and the external test cohort consisted of patients from two other centers. Two MRI-based DLRNs for prediction of tumor relapse after resection of STS were established. We universally tested the DLRNs and compared them with other prediction models constructed by using widespread adopted predictors (i.e., staging systems and Ki67) instead of radiomics features. RESULTS The DLRN1 model incorporated plain MRI-based radiomics signature into the clinical data, and the DLRN2 model integrated radiomics signature extracted from plain and contrast-enhanced MRI with the clinical predictors. Across both study sets, the two MRI-based DLRNs had relatively better prognostic capability (C index ≥ 0.721 and median AUC ≥ 0.746; p < 0.05 compared with most other models and predictors) and less opportunity for prediction error (integrated Brier score ≤ 0.159). The decision curve analysis indicates that the DLRNs have greater benefits than staging systems, Ki67, and other models. We selected appropriate cutoff values for the DLRNs to divide STS recurrence into three risk strata (low, medium, and high) and calculated those groups' cumulative risk rates. CONCLUSION The DLRNs were shown to be a reliable and externally validated tool for predicting STS recurrence by comparing with other prediction models. KEY POINTS • The prediction of a high recurrence rate of STS before emergence of local recurrence can help to determine whether more active treatment should be implemented. • Two MRI-based DLRNs for prediction of tumor relapse were shown to be a reliable and externally validated tool for predicting STS recurrence. • We used the DLRNs to divide STS recurrence into three risk strata (low, medium, and high) to facilitate more targeted postoperative management in the clinic.","Shunli Liu,Wei Sun,Shunli Liu,Weikai Sun,Shifeng Yang,Shifeng Yang,Lisha Duan,Chencui Huang,Lisha Duan,Jingxu Xu,Chencui Huang,Feng Hou,Jingxu Xu,Dapeng Hao,Feng Hou,Feng Hou,Tengbo Yu,Dapeng Hao,Hexiang Wang,Tengbo Yu,Hexiang Wang",European Radiology,2021.0
10.3389/fonc.2021.710909,,,Development and Validation of a 18F-FDG PET-Based Radiomic Model for Evaluating Hypermetabolic Mediastinal-Hilar Lymph Nodes in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.,"Background: Accurate evaluation of lymph node (LN) status is critical for determining the treatment options in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to develop and validate a 18F-FDG PET-based radiomic model for the identification of metastatic LNs from the hypermetabolic mediastinal-hilar LNs in NSCLC. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 259 patients with hyper-metabolic LNs who underwent pretreatment 18F-FDG PET/CT and were pathologically confirmed as NSCLC from two centers. 228 LNs were allocated to a training cohort (LN = 159) and an internal validation cohort (LN = 69) from one center (7:3 ratio), and 60 LNs were enrolled to an external validation cohort from the other. Radiomic features were extracted from LNs of PET images. PET radiomics signature was constructed by multivariable logistic regression after using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method with 10-fold cross-validation. The PET radiomics signature (model 1) and independent predictors from CT image features and clinical data (model 2) were incorporated into a combined model (model 3). A nomogram was plotted for the complex model, and the performance of the nomogram was assessed by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. Results: The area under the curve (AUC) values of the model 1 were 0.820,0.785 and 0.808 in the training cohort, internal, and external validation cohort, respectively, showing good diagnostic efficacy for lymph nodes metastasis (LNM). Furthermore, the model 2 was able to discriminate metastatic LNs in the training cohort (AUC 0.780), internal (AUC 0.794), and external validation cohort (AUC 0.802), respectively. Model 3 showed optimal diagnostic performance among the three cohorts, with an AUC of 0.874, 0.845, and 0.841, respectively. The nomogram based on the model 3 showed good discrimination and calibration. Conclusions: Our study revealed that PET radiomics signature, especially when integrated with CT imaging features, showed the ability to identify true and false positives of mediastinal–hilar LNM detected by PET/CT in patients with NSCLC, which would help clinicians to make individual treatment decisions.","Mingli Ouyang,Yiran Wang,Ming-li Ouyang,Yi-ran Wang,Qingshan Deng,Qing-shan Deng,Yefei Zhu,Zhenhua Zhao,Ye-fei Zhu,Zhenhua Zhao,Ling Wang,Zhenhua Zhao,Ling Wang,Liangxing Wang,Liang-xing Wang,Kun Tang,Kun Tang,Kun Tang",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0

Method: A total of 28 patients with HL and 101 patients with ICCA were included. A total of 45 texture features were extracted by the software LifeX from contrast-enhanced computer tomography (CECT) images and 38 of them were eligible. A total of 5 feature selection methods and 9 feature classification methods were used to build the best diagnostic models, combining with the 10-fold cross-validation to assess the accuracy of these models. The discriminative ability of each model was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Result: A total of 45 predictive models were built by the cross combination of each selection and classification method to differentiate ICCA from HL. According to the results of test group, most of the models performed well with a large area under the curve (AUC) (>0.85) and high accuracy (>0.85). Random Forest (RF)_Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (AUC=0.997, accuracy=0.969) was the best model among all the 45 models.

PURPOSE To establish a radiomics nomogram based on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for preoperatively evaluating TIL level. STUDY TYPE Retrospective. POPULATION A total of 154 patients with breast cancer were divided into a training cohort (N=87) and a test cohort (N=67), who were further divided into low TIL (<50%) and high TIL (≥50%) subgroups according to the histopathological results. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE 3.0T; axial T2-weighted imaging (fast spin echo), diffusion-weighted imaging (spin echo-echo planar imaging), and the volume imaging for breast assessment DCE sequence (gradient recalled echo). ASSESSMENT A radiomics signature was developed from the training dataset and independent risk factors were selected by multivariate logistic regression to build a clinical model. A nomogram model was built by combining radiomics score and risk factors. The performance of the nomogram was assessed using calibration curves and decision curves. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. STATISTICAL TESTS The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, t-tests and chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact test, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, ROC analysis, and decision curve analysis were conducted. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS The radiomics signature and nomogram model exhibited better calibration and validation performance in the training (radiomics: area under the curve [AUC] 0.86; nomogram: AUC 0.88) and test (radiomics: AUC 0.83; nomogram: AUC 0.84) datasets compared with clinical model (training: AUC 0.76; test: AUC 0.72). The decision curve demonstrated that the nomogram model exhibited better performance than the clinical model, with a threshold probability between 0.15 and 0.9.

NENs are found nearly anywhere in the body but the most frequent location is the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine neoplasms (GI-NENs) are rather uncommon, representing around 2% of all gastrointestinal tumours and 20-30% of all primary neoplasms of the small bowel. GI-NENs have various clinical manifestations due to the different substances they can produce; some of these tumours appear to be associated with familial syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasm and neurofibromatosis type 1. The current WHO classification (2019) divides NENs into three major categories: well-differentiated NENs, poorly differentiated NENs, and mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms. The diagnosis, localization, and staging of GI-NENs include morphology and functional imaging, above all contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), and in the field of nuclear medicine imaging, a key role is played by 68Ga-labelled-somatostatin analogues (68Ga-DOTA-peptides) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/TC).

10.1109/trpms.2021.3104297,,,Learning-based Cancer Treatment Outcome Prognosis using Multimodal Biomarkers,"Predicting early in treatment whether a tumor is likely to be responsive is a difficult yet important task to support clinical decision-making. Studies have shown that multimodal biomarkers could provide complementary information and lead to more accurate treatment outcome prognosis than unimodal biomarkers. However, the prognosis accuracy could be affected by multimodal data heterogeneity and incompleteness. The small-sized and imbalance datasets also bring additional challenges for training a designed prognosis model. In this study, a modular framework employing multimodal biomarkers for cancer treatment outcome prediction was proposed. It includes four modules of synthetic data generation, deep feature extraction, multimodal feature fusion, and classification to address the challenges described above. The feasibility and advantages of the designed framework were demonstrated through an example study, in which the goal was to stratify oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients with low-and high-risks of treatment failures by use of positron emission tomography (PET) image data and microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers. The superior prognosis performance and the comparison with other methods demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed framework and its ability of enabling seamless integration, validation and comparison of various algorithms in each module of the framework.

However, approximately 10% of primary prostate cancer are invisible on PSMA-PET (exhibit no or minimal uptake). In this work, we investigated whether machine learning-based radiomics models derived from PSMA-PET images could predict invisible intraprostatic lesions on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET in patients with primary prostate cancer. In this retrospective study, patients with or without prostate cancer who underwent 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and presented negative on PSMA-PET image at either of two different institutions were included: institution 1 (between 2017 and 2020) for the training set and institution 2 (between 2019 and 2020) for the external test set. Three random forest (RF) models were built using selected features extracted from standard PET images, delayed PET images, and both standard and delayed PET images. Then, subsequent tenfold cross-validation was performed. In the test phase, the three RF models and PSA density (PSAD, cut-off value: 0.15ng/ml/ml) were tested with the external test set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated for the models and PSAD. The AUCs of the radiomics model and PSAD were compared. A total of 64 patients (39 with prostate cancer and 25 with benign prostate disease) were in the training set, and 36 (21 with prostate cancer and 15 with benign prostate disease) were in the test set. The average AUCs of the three RF models from tenfold cross-validation were 0.87 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.00), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.00), and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.00), respectively. In the test set, the AUCs of the three trained RF models and PSAD were 0.903 (95% CI: 0.830, 0.975), 0.856 (95% CI: 0.748, 0.964), 0.925 (95% CI:0.838, 1.00), and 0.662 (95% CI: 0.510, 0.813). The AUCs of the three radiomics models were higher than that of PSAD (0.903, 0.856, and 0.925 vs. 0.662, respectively; P=.007, P=.045, and P=.005, respectively).

We aimed to investigate the value of MRI-based radiomics of the optic chiasm in predicting postoperative visual field outcome using machine learning technology. A total of 131 pituitary adenoma patients were retrospectively enrolled and divided into the recovery group (N = 79) and the non-recovery group (N = 52) according to visual field outcome following surgical chiasmal decompression. Radiomic features were extracted from the optic chiasm on preoperative coronal T2-weighted imaging. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were first used to select optimal features. Then, three machine learning algorithms were employed to develop radiomic models to predict visual recovery, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest and linear discriminant analysis. The prognostic performances of models were evaluated via five-fold cross-validation. The results showed that radiomic models using different machine learning algorithms all achieved area under the curve (AUC) over 0.750. The SVM-based model represented the best predictive performance for visual field recovery, with the highest AUC of 0.824. In conclusion, machine learning-based radiomics of the optic chiasm on routine MR imaging could potentially serve as a novel approach to preoperatively predict visual recovery and allow personalized counseling for individual pituitary adenoma patients.","Yang Zhang,Yang Zhang,Chaoyue Chen,Chaoyue Chen,Wei-Chin Huang,Yiming Cheng,Wei Huang,Yuen Teng,Yangfan Cheng,Yuen Teng,Lei Zhang,Lei Zhang,Lei Zhang,Jianguo Xu,Jianguo Xu",Journal of Personalized Medicine,2021.0
10.3390/jpm11090842,,,Making Radiomics More Reproducible across Scanner and Imaging Protocol Variations: A Review of Harmonization Methods,"Radiomics converts medical images into mineable data via a high-throughput extraction of quantitative features used for clinical decision support. However, these radiomic features are susceptible to variation across scanners, acquisition protocols, and reconstruction settings. Various investigations have assessed the reproducibility and validation of radiomic features across these discrepancies. In this narrative review, we combine systematic keyword searches with prior domain knowledge to discuss various harmonization solutions to make the radiomic features more reproducible across various scanners and protocol settings. Different harmonization solutions are discussed and divided into two main categories: image domain and feature domain. The image domain category comprises methods such as the standardization of image acquisition, post-processing of raw sensor-level image data, data augmentation techniques, and style transfer. The feature domain category consists of methods such as the identification of reproducible features and normalization techniques such as statistical normalization, intensity harmonization, ComBat and its derivatives, and normalization using deep learning. We also reflect upon the importance of deep learning solutions for addressing variability across multi-centric radiomic studies especially using generative adversarial networks (GANs), neural style transfer (NST) techniques, or a combination of both. We cover a broader range of methods especially GANs and NST methods in more detail than previous reviews.","Shruti Atul Mali,Abdalla Ibrahim,Shruti Atul Mali,Henry C.

10.1002/mp.15130,34374098.0,,Multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) for treatment response assessment of radiation therapy,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role in the modern radiation therapy (RT) workflow. In comparison with computed tomography (CT) imaging, which is the dominant imaging modality in RT, MRI possesses excellent soft-tissue contrast for radiographic evaluation. Based on quantitative models, MRI can be used to assess tissue functional and physiological information. With the developments of scanner design, acquisition strategy, advanced data analysis, and modeling, multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), a combination of morphologic and functional imaging modalities, has been increasingly adopted for disease detection, localization, and characterization. Integration of mpMRI techniques into RT enriches the opportunities to individualize RT. In particular, RT response assessment using mpMRI allows for accurate characterization of both tissue anatomical and biochemical changes to support decision-making in monotherapy of radiation treatment and/or systematic cancer management. In recent years, accumulating evidence have, indeed, demonstrated the potentials of mpMRI in RT response assessment regarding patient stratification, trial benchmarking, early treatment intervention, and outcome modeling. Clinical application of mpMRI for treatment response assessment in routine radiation oncology workflow, however, is more complex than implementing an additional imaging protocol; mpMRI requires additional focus on optimal study design, practice standardization, and unified statistical reporting strategy to realize its full potential in the context of RT. In this article, the mpMRI theories, including image mechanism, protocol design, and data analysis, will be reviewed with a focus on the radiation oncology field. Representative works will be discussed to demonstrate how mpMRI can be used for RT response assessment. Additionally, issues and limits of current works, as well as challenges and potential future research directions, will also be discussed.","Chunhao Wang,Chunhao Wang,Kyle R.

In particular, we aim at automatically predicting Disease-Free Survival (DFS) for patients treated with radiotherapy or both radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We design a multi-task deep UNet to learn both the segmentation of the primary Gross Tumor Volume (GTVt) and the outcome of the patient from PET and CT images. The motivation for this approach lies in the complementarity of the two tasks and the shared visual features relevant to both tasks. A multi-modal (PET and CT) 3D UNet is trained with a combination of survival and Dice losses to jointly learn the two tasks. The model is evaluated on the HECKTOR 2020 dataset consisting of 239 H&N patients with PET, CT, GTVt contours and DFS data (five centers). The results are compared with a standard Cox PET/CT radiomics model. The proposed multi-task CNN reaches a C-index of 0.723, outperforming both the deep radiomics model without segmentation (C-index of 0.650) and the standard radiomics model (C-index of 0.695). Besides the improved performance in outcome prediction, the main advantage of the proposed multi-task approach is that it can predict patient prognosis without a manual delineation of the GTVt, a tedious and time-consuming process that hinders the validation of large-scale radiomics studies. The code will be shared for reproducibility on our GitHub repository.","Vincent Andrearczyk,Pierre Fontaine,Vincent Andrearczyk,Valentin Oreiller,Pierre Fontaine,J.

Multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) has high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of PCa, and it is currently the most widely used imaging technique for tumor localization and cancer staging. mp-MRI plays a key role in risk stratification of naive patients, in active surveillance for low-risk patients, and in monitoring recurrence after definitive therapy. Radiomics is an emerging and promising tool which allows a quantitative tumor evaluation from radiological images via conversion of digital images into mineable high-dimensional data. The purpose of radiomics is to increase the features available to detect PCa, to avoid unnecessary biopsies, to define tumor aggressiveness, and to monitor post-treatment recurrence of PCa. The integration of radiomics data, including different imaging modalities (such as PET-CT) and other clinical and histopathological data, could improve the prediction of tumor aggressiveness as well as guide clinical decisions and patient management. The purpose of this review is to describe the current research applications of radiomics in PCa on MR images.","Federico Midiri,Federica Vernuccio,Federico Midiri,Federica Vernuccio,Pierpaolo Purpura,Pierpaolo Purpura,Pierpaolo Alongi,Pierpaolo Alongi,Tommaso Vincenzo Bartolotta,Tommaso Vincenzo Bartolotta",,2021.0

Recently, the availability of targeted strategies and of immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has favorably changed patient prognosis. Treatment outcome is closely related to tumor biology and interaction with the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). While the response in molecular targeted therapies relies on the presence of specific genetic alterations in tumor cells, accurate ICI biomarkers of response are lacking, and clinical outcome likely depends on multiple factors that are both host and tumor-related. This paper is an overview of the ongoing research on predictive factors both from in vitro/ex vivo analysis (ranging from conventional pathology to molecular biology) and in vivo analysis, where molecular imaging is showing an exponential growth and use due to technological advancements and to the new bioinformatics approaches applied to image analyses that allow the recovery of specific features in specific tumor subclones.","Virginia Liberini,Annapaola Mariniello,Virginia Liberini,Liberini,Annapaola Mariniello,Annapaola Mariniello,Luisella Righi,Martina Capozza,Luisella Righi,Righi L,Capozza M,Martina Capozza,Marco Donatello Delcuratolo,Delcuratolo,Marco Donatello Delcuratolo,Enzo Terreno,Mohsen Farsad,Enzo Terreno,Terreno E,Farsad M,Marco Volante,Silvia Novello,Volante M,Marco Volante,Silvia Novello,Silvia Novello,Silvia Novello,Désirèe Deandreis,Novello S,Désirée Deandreis,Désirée Deandreis",,2021.0

METHODS Two hundred and five patients with uterine leiomyomas treated by HIFU were enrolled and allocated to training (N=164) and testing cohorts (N=41). Pyradiomics was used to extract radiomics features from T2-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map generated from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The clinico-radiological model, radiomics model, and radiomics-clinical model which combined the selected radiomics features and clinical parameters were used to predict technical outcomes determined by NPV ratios where three classification groups were created (NPV ratio ≤ 50%, 50-80% or ≥ 80%). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), and calibration and decision curve analyses were performed to illustrate the prediction performance and clinical usefulness of model in the training and testing cohorts. RESULTS The multi-parametric MRI-based radiomics model outperformed T2-weighted imaging (T2WI)-based radiomics model, which achieved an average AUC of 0.769 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.701-0.842), and showed satisfactory prediction performance for NPV ratio classification. The radiomics-clinical model demonstrated best prediction performance for HIFU treatment outcome, with an average AUC of 0.802 (95% CI, 0.796-0.850) and an accuracy of 0.762 (95% CI, 0.698-0.815) in the testing cohort, compared to the clinico-radiological and radiomics models. The decision curve also indicated favorable clinical usefulness of the radiomics-clinical model.

10.3389/fonc.2021.678441,,,Performances of Whole Tumor Texture Analysis Based on MRI: Predicting Preoperative T Stage of Rectal Carcinomas.,"Objective: To determine whether there is a correlation between texture features extracted from high-resolution T2-weighted imaging (HR-T2WI) or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and the preoperative T stage (stages T1–2 versus T3–4) in rectal carcinomas. Materials and Methods: One hundred and fifty four patients with rectal carcinomas who underwent preoperative HR-T2WI and diffusion-weighted imaging were enrolled. Patients were divided into training (n = 89) and validation (n = 65) cohorts. 3D Slicer was used to segment the entire volume of interest for whole tumors based on HR-T2WI and ADC maps. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was performed to select feature. The significantly difference was tested by the independent sample t-test and Mann-Whitney U test. The support vector machine (SVM) model was used to develop classification models. The correlation between features and T stage was assessed by Spearman’s correlation analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of tumor invasion. The performance of classifiers was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: The wavelet HHH NGTDM strength (RS = -0.364, P < 0.001) from HR-T2WI was an independent predictor of stage T3–4 tumors. The shape maximum 2D diameter column (RS = 0.431, P < 0.001), log σ = 5.0 mm 3D first-order maximum (RS = 0.276, P = 0.009), and log σ = 5.0 mm 3D first-order interquartile range (RS = -0.229, P = 0.032) from ADC maps were independent predictors. In training cohorts, the classification models from HR-T2WI, ADC maps and the combination of two achieved the area under the ROC curves (AUCs) of 0.877, 0.902 and 0.941, with the accuracy of 79.78%, 89.86% and 89.89%, respectively. In validation cohorts, the three models achieved AUCs of 0.845, 0.881 and 0.910, with the accuracy of 78.46%, 83.08% and 87.69%, respectively. Conclusions: Texture analysis based on ADC maps shows more potential than HR-T2WI in identifying preoperative T stage in rectal carcinomas. The combined application of HR-T2WI and ADC maps may help to improve the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis of rectal cancer invasion.","Jia You,Jia You,Jiandong Yin,Jiandong Yin",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0

Radiomics und künstliche Intelligenz gehören seit gut fünf Jahren zu den am schnellsten wachsenden methodischen Arbeitsgebieten innerhalb der medizinischen Forschung. Sie versprechen insbesondere, komplexe Zusammenhänge in Bilddaten und strukturierten Patientendaten aufzuspüren und daraus prädiktive Klassifikationen abzuleiten. Mit anderen Worten sollen sie dabei helfen, die rasant zunehmende Komplexität der medizinischen Versorgung zu meistern. Selbst innerhalb eng gefasster Spezialgebiete ist das laufend neu entstehende Wissen oftmals kaum überschaubar und daher in der klinischen Routine nur unvollständig anwendbar. In der Krebsversorgung, etwa bei der onkologischen Phänotypisierung und Therapieoptimierung, ist diese Komplexitätszunahme besonders stark spürbar. Die Nuklearmedizin hat dort bei Diagnose, Staging, Therapieauswahl und Erfolgskontrolle ihren festen Platz, und mit geringem Zeitversatz sind Radiomics und KI auch dort mit schnell wachsenden Publikationsraten angekommen. Innerhalb der KI ist es allen voran das tiefe maschinelle Lernen (Deep Learning), das seit 2015 dabei ist, die konventionelle Mustererkennung fast völlig abzulösen. Anders als das klassische Radiomics besitzt Deep Learning durch das sog. Selbstlernen die Fähigkeit, relevante Muster auch in heterogenen, schlecht standardisierten Daten zu erkennen. Die für komplexe Fragestellungen notwendigen integrierten Daten müssen in vielen Fällen jedoch erst noch in ausreichender Menge verfügbar gemacht werden. Dennoch ist bereits absehbar, dass einige der künftig generierten KI-Vorhersagen nicht mehr vom Menschen nachvollziehbar sein werden. Umso wichtiger werden für die Zukunft eine präzise Zieldefinition sein sowie die enge Kooperationen zwischen methodischer Forschung, klinischer Anwendung und ethischer Begleitforschung.","Horst K.

The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of using both pre-treatment patient features and radiomic features extracted from a pre-treatment contrast enhanced computed tomography scan to predict the need for adaptive radiotherapy. Seventy-two patients were included in the analysis, of which 36 required adaptation. 36 pre-treatment semantic features as well as 351 radiomic features extracted from the gross target volume were considered. Three support vector machine models were developed: 1) considering only semantic features; 2) considering only radiomic features; 3) using a combination of features from 1 and 2. A robustness analysis of the selected radiomic features was also conducted. The best classification results were obtained considering 6 features (4 semantic and 2 radiomic) with median accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.821 and 0.843, respectively.","Natália Alves,Joana Dias,Natália Alves,Tiago Ventura,Joana Dias,J.

To predict the biological property of TNBC, the performance using quantitative high-throughput sonographic feature analysis was compared with that using qualitative feature assessment.  Methods  We retrospectively reviewed ultrasound images, clinical, pathological, and immunohistochemical (IHC) data of 252 female TNBC patients. All patients were subgrouped according to the histological grade, Ki67 expression level, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) score. Qualitative sonographic feature assessment included shape, margin, posterior acoustic pattern, and calcification referring to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). Quantitative sonographic features were acquired based on the computer-aided radiomics analysis. Breast cancer masses were manually segmented from the surrounding breast tissues. For each ultrasound image, 1688 radiomics features of 7 feature classes were extracted. The principal component analysis (PCA), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and support vector machine (SVM) were used to determine the high-throughput radiomics features that were highly correlated to biological properties. The performance using both quantitative and qualitative sonographic features to predict biological properties of TNBC was represented by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).  Results  In the qualitative assessment, regular tumor shape, no angular or spiculated margin, posterior acoustic enhancement, and no calcification were used as the independent sonographic features for TNBC. Using the combination of these four features to predict the histological grade, Ki67, HER2, axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM), and lymphovascular invasion (LVI), the AUC was 0.673, 0.680, 0.651, 0.587, and 0.566, respectively. The number of high-throughput features that closely correlated with biological properties was 34 for histological grade (AUC 0.942), 27 for Ki67 (AUC 0.732), 25 for HER2 (AUC 0.730), 34 for ALNM (AUC 0.804), and 34 for LVI (AUC 0.795).  Conclusion  High-throughput quantitative sonographic features are superior to traditional qualitative ultrasound features in predicting the biological behavior of TNBC.  Key points  • Sonographic appearances of TNBCs showed a great variety in accordance with its biological and clinical characteristics. • Both qualitative and quantitative sonographic features of TNBCs are associated with tumor biological characteristics. • The quantitative high-throughput feature analysis is superior to two-dimensional sonographic feature assessment in predicting tumor biological property.","Jiawei Li,Yucheng Cao,Jia Wei Li,Jiawei Li,Zhi‐jin Zhao,Yucheng Cao,Yu‑cheng Cao,Zhaoting Shi,Zhi-Jin Zhao,Zhao-Ting Shi,Zhao Ting Shi,Xi Duan,Xiaoqian Duan,Cai Chang,Xiao‑qian Duan,Cai Chang,Jian‐gang Chen,Jiangang Chen,Jian‑gang Chen",European Radiology,2021.0

METHODS Radiomics features were extracted from 106 enhanced computed tomography images with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Support vector machine-recursive feature elimination was used for feature selection. Support vector machine algorithm was used to develop radiomics scores to predict genetic alterations in oncogenic signaling pathways. The performance was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS The alterations of the Cell Cycle, HIPPO, NOTCH, PI3K, RTK RAS, and TP53 signaling pathways were predicted by radiomics scores. The AUC values of the training cohort were 0.94, 0.91, 0.94, 0.93, 0.87, and 0.93, respectively. The AUC values of the validation cohort were all greater than 0.7.

10.3389/fonc.2021.709339,,,Preoperative Prediction of Microvascular Invasion in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma Based on Radiomics Nomogram Using Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound.,"Abstract Purpose: This study aimed to develop a radiomics nomogram based on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for preoperatively assessing microvascular invasion (MVI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Methods: A retrospective dataset of 313 HCC patients who underwent CEUS between September 20, 2016 and March 20, 2020 was enrolled in our study. The study population was randomly grouped as a primary dataset of 192 patients and a validation dataset of 121 patients. Radiomics features were extracted from the B-mode (BM), artery phase (AP), portal venous phase (PVP) and delay phase (DP) images of preoperatively acquired CEUS of each patient. After feature selection, the BM, AP, PVP and DP radiomics scores (Rad-score) were constructed from the primary dataset. The four radiomics scores and clinical factors were used for multivariate logistic regression analysis, and a radiomics nomogram was then developed. We also built a preoperative clinical prediction model for comparison. The performance of the radiomics nomogram was evaluated via calibration, discrimination and clinical usefulness. Results: Multivariate analysis indicated that the PVP and DP Rad-score, tumor size and AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) level were independent risk predictors associated with MVI. The radiomics nomogram incorporating these four predictors revealed superior discrimination to the clinical model (based on tumor size and AFP level) in the primary dataset (AUC: 0.849 vs. 0.690; p < 0.001) and validation dataset (AUC: 0.788 vs. 0.661; p = 0.008), with good calibration. Decision curve analysis also confirmed that the radiomics nomogram was clinically useful. Furthermore, the significant improvement of net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated discriminatory improvement (IDI) implied that the PVP and DP radiomics signatures may be very useful biomarkers for MVI prediction in HCC. Conclusion: The CEUS-based radiomics nomogram showed favorable predictive value for the preoperative identification of MVI in HCC patients and could guide more appropriate surgical planning.","Di Zhang,Di Zhang,Qi Wei,Qi Wei,Ge-Ge Wu,Ge-Ge Wu,Xian-Ya Zhang,Wenwu Lu,Xian-Ya Zhang,Wen-Wu Lu,Wenzhi Lv,Junlin Liao,Wenzhi Lv,Jin-Tang Liao,Xin-Wu Cui,Xuejun Ni,Xin-Wu Cui,Christoph F.

10.3389/fonc.2021.698373,,,Progress of MRI Radiomics in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer in the world and the third leading cause of cancer-related death. Although the diagnostic scheme of HCC is currently undergoing refinement, the prognosis of HCC is still not satisfactory. In addition to certain factors, such as tumor size and number and vascular invasion displayed on traditional imaging, some histopathological features and gene expression parameters are also important for the prognosis of HCC patients. However, most parameters are based on postoperative pathological examinations, which cannot help with preoperative decision-making. As a new field, radiomics extracts high-throughput imaging data from different types of images to build models and predict clinical outcomes noninvasively before surgery, rendering it a powerful aid for making personalized treatment decisions preoperatively. Objective This study reviewed the workflow of radiomics and the research progress on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics in the diagnosis and treatment of HCC. Methods A literature review was conducted by searching PubMed for search of relevant peer-reviewed articles published from May 2017 to June 2021.The search keywords included HCC, MRI, radiomics, deep learning, artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural network, texture analysis, diagnosis, histopathology, microvascular invasion, surgical resection, radiofrequency, recurrence, relapse, transarterial chemoembolization, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, therapeutic response, and prognosis. Results Radiomics features on MRI can be used as biomarkers to determine the differential diagnosis, histological grade, microvascular invasion status, gene expression status, local and systemic therapeutic responses, and prognosis of HCC patients.

It is progressing from conventional healthcare systems to more personalized healthcare systems, where patients can be monitored, diagnosed and treated effortlessly. Radiomics is a sub-field of machine learning (ML) that mines quantitative features from radiological images relying on an image-based approach with ML models, which procure information surpassing orthodox medical imaging analysis as diagnosis, prognosis, prediction and response to therapy. The upsurge in the number of radiological images increases the workload of radiologist which in turns decreases their performance, thus they can only detect and evaluate a small portion of information present in images within a short-time. Hence, there is need for a better method for the increase in radiological image selection, detection and evaluation processes thereby reducing the workload of experts. Therefore, this chapter discusses the different types and sources of radiological data, feature extraction and selection method for image analysis. The chapter also presents different ML models ideal for the radiomics and parameter tuning. The challenges, applicability and limitations of Radiomics are also described in this chapter. The radiomic process involves radiological image gathering, segmentation, feature extraction and selection, model building and evaluation. Each of the stage of the process workflow is carefully evaluated for development of a reliable, effective and robust model to be shifted into medical practice for disease diagnosis and prognosis response to treatment.","Joseph Bamidele Awotunde,Sakinat Oluwabukonla Folorunso,Femi Emmanuel Ayo,Joseph Bamidele Awotunde,Khadijah-Khuburah Adebisi Abdullah,Femi Emmanuel Ayo,Khadijah-Khuburah Adebisi Abdullah",,2021.0

PURPOSE To investigate the diagnostic performance of radiomics models based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) for preoperatively evaluating the tumor consistency of PMA. STUDY TYPE Retrospective. POPULATION One hundred and fifty-six PMA patients (soft consistency, N=104 vs. hard consistency, N=52), divided into training (N=108) and test (N=48) cohorts. The tumor consistency was determined on surgical findings. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), contrast-enhanced T1WI (T1CE), and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) using spin-echo sequences with a 3.0-T scanner. ASSESSMENT An automated three-dimensional (3D) segmentation was performed to generate the volume of interest (VOI) on T2WI, then T1WI/T1CE were coregistered to T2WI. A total of 388 radiomic features were extracted on each VOI of mpMRI. The top-discriminative features were identified using the minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance method and 0.632+ bootstrapping. The radiomics models based on each sequence and their combinations were established via the random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), and independently evaluated for their ability in distinguishing PMA consistency. STATISTICAL TESTS Mann-Whitney U-test and Chi-square test were used for comparison analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and relative standard deviation (RSD) were calculated to evaluate each model's performance. ACC with P-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Eleven mpMRI-based features exhibited statistically significant differences between soft and hard PMA in the training cohort. The radiomics model built on combined T1WI/T1CE/T2WI demonstrated the best performance among all the radiomics models with an AUC of 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87-0.92), ACC of 0.87 (CI: 0.84-0.89), SEN of 0.83 (CI: 0.81-0.85), and SPE of 0.87 (CI: 0.85-0.99) in the test cohort.

10.1002/mp.15199,34453332.0,,Radiomics analysis combining unsupervised learning and handcrafted features: A multiple-disease study.,"PURPOSE To study and investigate the synergistic benefit of incorporating both conventional handcrafted and learning-based features in disease identification across a wide range of clinical setups. METHODS AND MATERIALS In this retrospective study, we collected 170/150/209/137 patients with four different disease types associated with identification objectives of: lymph node metastasis status of gastric cancer (GC), 5-year survival status of patients with high-grade osteosarcoma (HOS), early recurrence status of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), and pathological grades of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs). CT and MR were used to derive image features for GC/HOS/pNETs and ICC respectively. In each study, 67 universal handcrafted features and study-specific features based on sparse autoencoder (SAE) method were extracted and fed into the subsequent feature selection and learning model to predict the corresponding disease identification. Models using handcrafted alone, SAE alone, and hybrid features were optimized and their performance was compared. Prominent features were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively to generate study-specific and cross-study insight. In addition to direct performance gain assessment, correlation analysis was performed to assess the complementarity between handcrafted features and SAE features. RESULTS On the independent hold-off test, the handcrafted, SAE, and hybrid features based prediction yielded AUC of 0.761 vs 0.769 vs 0.829 for GC, 0.629 vs 0.740 vs 0.709 for HOS, 0.717 vs 0.718 vs 0.758 for ICC, and 0.739 vs 0.715 vs 0.771 for pNETs studies respectively. In three out of the four studies, prediction using the hybrid features yields the best performance, demonstrating the general benefit in using hybrid features. Prediction with SAE features alone had the best performance in the HOS study, which may be explained by the complexity of HOS prognosis and the possibility of a slight overfit due to higher correlation between handcrafted and SAE features. CONCLUSION This study demonstrated the general benefit of combing handcrafted and learning-based features in radiomics modelling. It also clearly illustrates the task-specific and data-specific dependency on the performance gain and suggests that while the common methodology of feature combination may be applied across various studies and tasks, study-specific feature selection and model optimization is still necessary to achieve high accuracy and robustness.

Reproducibility of radiomics features is a known issue that is addressed by the image biomarker standardisation initiative (IBSI), but it remains challenging to interpret previously published radiomics signatures. This study investigates the reproducibility of radiomics features calculated with two widely used radiomics software packages (IBEX, MaZda) in comparison to an IBSI compliant software package (PyRadiomics). Intensity histogram, shape and textural features were extracted from 334 diffusion weighted magnetic resonance images of 59 head and neck cancer (HNC) patients from the PREDICT-HN observational radiotherapy study. Based on name and linear correlation, PyRadiomics shares 83 features with IBEX and 49 features with MaZda, a sub-set of well correlated features are considered reproducible (IBEX: 15 features, MaZda: 18 features). We explore the impact of including non-reproducible radiomics features in a HNC radiotherapy response model. It is possible to classify equivalent patient groups using radiomic features from either software, but only when restricting the model to reliable features using a correlation threshold method. This is relevant for clinical biomarker validation trials as it provides a framework to assess the reproducibility of reported radiomic signatures from existing trials.","J.

We used a bibliometric analysis to analyze the publications of radiomics in oncology to clearly illustrate the current situation and future trends and encourage more researchers to participate in radiomics research in oncology. Methods Publications for radiomics in oncology were downloaded from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). WoSCC data were collected, and CiteSpace was used for a bibliometric analysis of countries, institutions, journals, authors, keywords, and references pertaining to this field. The state of research and areas of focus were analyzed through burst detection. Results A total of 7,199 pieces of literature concerning radiomics in oncology were analyzed on CiteSpace. The number of publications has undergone rapid growth and continues to increase. The USA and Chinese Academy of Sciences are found to be the most prolific country and institution, respectively. In terms of journals and co-cited journals, Scientific Reports is ranked highest with respect to the number of publications, and Radiology is ranked highest among co-cited journals. Moreover, Jie Tian has published the most publications, and Phillipe Lambin is the most cited author. A paper published by Gillies etal. presents the highest citation counts. Artificial intelligence (AI), segmentation methods, and the use of radiomics for classification and diagnosis in oncology are major areas of focus in this field. Test-retest statistics, including reproducibility and statistical methods of radiomics research, the relation between genomics and radiomics, and applications of radiomics to sarcoma and intensity-modulated radiotherapy, are frontier areas of this field.

10.3390/cancers13184638,,,Reproducibility of CT-Based Hepatocellular Carcinoma Radiomic Features across Different Contrast Imaging Phases: A Proof of Concept on SORAMIC Trial Data,"Handcrafted radiomic features (HRFs) are quantitative imaging features extracted from regions of interest on medical images which can be correlated with clinical outcomes and biologic characteristics. While HRFs have been used to train predictive and prognostic models, their reproducibility has been reported to be affected by variations in scan acquisition and reconstruction parameters, even within the same imaging vendor. In this work, we evaluated the reproducibility of HRFs across the arterial and portal venous phases of contrast-enhanced computed tomography images depicting hepatocellular carcinomas, as well as the potential of ComBat harmonization to correct for this difference. ComBat harmonization is a method based on Bayesian estimates that was developed for gene expression arrays, and has been investigated as a potential method for harmonizing HRFs. Our results show that the majority of HRFs are not reproducible between the arterial and portal venous imaging phases, yet a number of HRFs could be used interchangeably between those phases. Furthermore, ComBat harmonization increased the number of reproducible HRFs across both phases by 1%. Our results guide the pooling of arterial and venous phases from different patients in an effort to increase cohort size, as well as joint analysis of the phases.","Abdalla Ibrahim,Abdalla Ibrahim,Yousif Widaatalla,Yousif Widaatalla,Sergey Primakov,Razvan L.

10.1016/j.ejmp.2021.08.015,34521016.0,,Strategies to develop radiomics and machine learning models for lung cancer stage and histology prediction using small data samples.,"Abstract   Predictive models based on radiomics and machine-learning (ML) need large and annotated datasets for training, often difficult to collect. We designed an operative pipeline for model training to exploit data already available to the scientific community. The aim of this work was to explore the capability of radiomic features in predicting tumor histology and stage in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  We analyzed the radiotherapy planning thoracic CT scans of a proprietary sample of 47 subjects (L-RT) and integrated this dataset with a publicly available set of 130 patients from the MAASTRO NSCLC collection (Lung1). We implemented intra- and inter-sample cross-validation strategies (CV) for evaluating the ML predictive model performances with not so large datasets.  We carried out two classification tasks: histology classification (3 classes) and overall stage classification (two classes: stage I and II). In the first task, the best performance was obtained by a Random Forest classifier, once the analysis has been restricted to stage I and II tumors of the Lung1 and L-RT merged dataset (AUC=0.72±0.11). For the overall stage classification, the best results were obtained when training on Lung1 and testing of L-RT dataset (AUC=0.72±0.04 for Random Forest and AUC=0.84±0.03 for linear-kernel Support Vector Machine).  According to the classification task to be accomplished and to the heterogeneity of the available dataset(s), different CV strategies have to be explored and compared to make a robust assessment of the potential of a predictive model based on radiomics and ML.","Leonardo Ubaldi,L.

10.1002/mp.15172,34412155.0,,TN-USMA Net: Triple normalization-based gastrointestinal stromal tumors classification on multicenter EUS images with ultrasound-specific pretraining and meta attention.,"PURPOSE Accurate quantification of gastrointestinal stromal tumors' (GISTs) risk stratification on multi-center endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) images plays a pivotal role in aiding the surgical decision-making process. This study focuses on automatically classifying higher-risk and lower-risk GISTs in the presence of a multi-center setting and limited data. METHODS In this study, we retrospectively enrolled 914 patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (1824 EUS images in total) from 18 hospitals in China. We propose a triple normalization based deep learning framework with ultrasound specific pre-training and meta attention, namely TN-USMA model. The triple normalization module consists of the intensity normalization, size normalization and spatial resolution normalization. Firstly, the image intensity is standardized and same-size regions of interest (ROIs) and same-resolution tumor masks are generated in parallel. Then, the transfer learning strategy is utilized to mitigate the data scarcity problem. The same-size ROIs are fed into a deep architecture with ultrasound specific pre-trained weights which are obtained from self-supervised learning using a large volume of unlabeled ultrasound images. Meanwhile, tumors' size features are calculated from the same-resolution masks individually. Afterwards, the size features together with two demographic features are integrated to the model before the final classification layer using a meta attention mechanism to further enhance feature representations. The diagnostic performance of the proposed method was compared with one radiomics based method and two state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Four evaluation metrics, namely the accuracy, the area under the receiver operator curve, the sensitivity and the specificity were used to evaluate the model performance. RESULTS The proposed TN-USMA model achieves an overall accuracy of 0.834 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.772, 0.885), an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.881 (95% CI: 0.825, 0.924), a sensitivity of 0.844 (95% CI: 0.672, 0.947) and a specificity of 0.832 (95% CI: 0.762, 0.888). The AUC significantly outperforms other two deep learning approaches (p<0.05, DeLong et al). Moreover, the performance is stable under different variations of multi-center dataset partitions. CONCLUSIONS The proposed TN-USMA model can successfully differentiate higher-risk GISTs from lower-risk ones. It is accurate, robust, generalizable and efficient for potential clinical applications.

10.1007/978-3-030-87196-3_24,,,Unsupervised Contrastive Learning of Radiomics and Deep Features for Label-Efficient Tumor Classification,"Tumor classification is important for decision support of precision medicine. Computer-aided diagnosis by convolutional neural networks relies on a large amount of annotated dataset, which is costly sometimes. To solve the poor predictive ability caused by tumor heterogeneity and inadequate labeled image data, a self-supervised learning method combined with radiomics is proposed to learn rich visual representation about tumors without human supervision. A self-supervised pretext task, namely “Radiomics-Deep Feature Correspondence”, is formulated to maximize agreement between radiomics view and deep learning view of the same sample in the latent space. The presented self-supervised model is evaluated on two public medical image datasets of thyroid nodule and kidney tumor and achieves high score on linear evaluations. Furthermore, fine-tuning the pre-trained network leads to a better score than the train-from-scratch models on the tumor classification task and shows label-efficient performance using small training datasets. This shows injecting radiomics prior knowledge about tumors into the representation space can build a more powerful self-supervised method.","Ziteng Zhao,Guang Yang,Ziteng Zhao,Guanyu Yang,Guanyu Yang,Guanyu Yang",,2021.0

However, precise predictors of treatment outcomes are still lacking. This study aimed to use angiographic parametric imaging (API)-derived radiomics features to explore whether biomarkers extracted from immediate postprocedural digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were associated with complications and embolization outcomes of IAs treated with PED without adjunctive coils. METHODS Radiomic features were extracted from postprocedural DSA by API, and radiomics feature selection and radiomics score calculation were performed by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression. Angiographic findings and clinical characteristics were screened using stepwise multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify significant variables for predicting the complication endpoint. Radiomics feature selection and radiomics risk score (RadRS) calculations were performed by LASSO Cox regression. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify significant predictors for the occlusion endpoint. RESULTS We screened 281 observations for complications and 235 observations for embolization outcomes from IAs treated in our center using PED between June 2015 and July 2020. Multivariate regression analysis showed association of the radiomics score (p<0.01) and hypertension (p=0.04) with complications. RadRS (p<0.01), symptoms (p<0.01), and age (p=0.03) were predictors of embolization outcomes.

10.3348/kjr.2021.0055,,,Volumetric ct texture analysis of intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma for the prediction of postoperative outcomes: Fully automatic tumor segmentation versus semi-automatic segmentation,"OBJECTIVE To determine whether volumetric CT texture analysis (CTTA) using fully automatic tumor segmentation can help predict recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinomas (IMCCs) after surgical resection. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study analyzed the preoperative CT scans of 89 patients with IMCCs (64 male; 25 female; mean age, 62.1 years; range, 38-78 years) who underwent surgical resection between January 2005 and December 2016. Volumetric CTTA of IMCCs was performed in late arterial phase images using both fully automatic and semi-automatic liver tumor segmentation techniques. The time spent on segmentation and texture analysis was compared, and the first-order and second-order texture parameters and shape features were extracted. The reliability of CTTA parameters between the techniques was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Intra- and interobserver reproducibility of volumetric CTTAs were also obtained using ICCs. Cox proportional hazard regression were used to predict RFS using CTTA parameters and clinicopathological parameters. RESULTS The time spent on fully automatic tumor segmentation and CTTA was significantly shorter than that for semi-automatic segmentation: mean ± standard deviation of 1 minutes 37 seconds ± 50 seconds vs. 10 minutes 48 seconds ± 13 minutes 44 seconds (p < 0.001). ICCs of the texture features between the two techniques ranged from 0.215 to 0.980. ICCs for the intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility using fully automatic segmentation were 0.601-0.997 and 0.177-0.984, respectively. Multivariable analysis identified lower first-order mean (hazard ratio [HR], 0.982; p = 0.010), larger pathologic tumor size (HR, 1.171; p < 0.001), and positive lymph node involvement (HR, 2.193; p = 0.014) as significant parameters for shorter RFS using fully automatic segmentation. CONCLUSION Volumetric CTTA parameters obtained using fully automatic segmentation could be utilized as prognostic markers in patients with IMCC, with comparable reproducibility in significantly less time compared with semi-automatic segmentation.","Se Hyung Kim,Sungeun Park,Sungeun Park,Jeong Min Lee,Jeong Min Lee,Junghoan Park,Junghoan Park,Ji Hyuk Lee,Jihyuk Lee,Jae Seok Bae,Jae Hyun Kim,Jae Seok Bae,Jong Hyuk Lee,Jae Hyun Kim,Ijin Joo,Ijin Joo",Korean Journal of Radiology,2021.0

Deep learning (DL) is a field of ML that can be defined as a set of algorithms enabling a computer to be fed with raw data and progressively discover-through multiple layers of representation-more complex and abstract patterns in large data sets. The combination of ML and radiomics, namely the extraction of features from medical images, has proven valuable, too: Radiomic information can be used for enhanced image characterization and prognosis or outcome prediction. This chapter summarizes the basic concepts underlying ML application for neuroimaging and discusses technical aspects of the most promising algorithms, with a specific focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), in order to provide the readership with the fundamental theoretical tools to better understand ML in neuroimaging.

The current study aimed to quantitatively assess the pulmonary HRCT images of MDA5+ DM-ILD by applying the radiomics approach and establish a multidimensional risk prediction model for the 6-month mortality. Methods This retrospective study was conducted in 228 patients from two centers, including a derivation cohort and a longitudinal internal validation cohort in Renji Hospital; as well as an external validation cohort in Guangzhou. The derivation cohort was randomly divided into training and testing sets. The primary outcome was 6-month all-cause mortality since the time of admission. Baseline pulmonary HRCT images were quantitatively analyzed by radiomics approach and a radiomic score (Rad-score) was generated. Clinical predictors selected by univariable Cox regression were further incorporated with the Rad-score, to enhance the prediction performance of the final model (Rad-score plus model). In parallel, an idiopathy pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)-based visual CT score and ILD-GAP score were calculated as comparators. Results The Rad-score was significantly associated with the 6-month mortality, outperformed the traditional visual score and ILD-GAP score. The Rad-score plus model was successfully developed to predict the 6-month mortality, with C-index values of 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79–0.96) in the training set (n = 121), 0.88 (95%CI, 0.71–1.0) in the testing set (n = 31), 0.83 (95%CI, 0.68–0.98) in the internal validation cohort (n = 44), and 0.84 (95%CI, 0.64–1.0) in the external validation cohort (n = 32).

10.3389/fonc.2021.744311,,,A Novel Clinical-Radiomics Model Based on Sarcopenia and Radiomics for Predicting the Prognosis of Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma After Radical Hepatectomy,"Abstract Background: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a highly aggressive malignant tumor with a poor prognosis. This study aimed to establish a novel clinical-radiomics model for predicting the prognosis of ICC after radical hepatectomy. Methods: A clinical-radiomics model was established for 82 cases of ICC treated with radical hepatectomy in our hospital from May 2011 to December 2020. Radiomics features were extracted from venous-phase and arterial-phase images of computed tomography. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was generated to compare overall survival (OS) between different groups. The independent factors were identified by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Nomogram performance was evaluated regarding discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. C-index and area under the curve (AUC) were utilized to compare the predictive performance between the clinical-radiomics model and conventional staging systems. Results: The radiomics model included five features. The AUC of the radiomics model was 0.817 in the training cohort, and 0.684 in the validation cohort. The clinical-radiomics model included psoas muscle index, radiomics score, hepatolithiasis, carcinoembryonic antigen, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. The reliable C-index of the model was 0.768, which was higher than that of other models. The AUC of the model for predicting OS at 1, and 3 years was 0.809 and 0.886, which was significantly higher than that of the American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th staging system (0.594 and 0.619), radiomics model (0.743 and 0.770), and tumor differentiation (0.645 and 0.628). After stratification according to the constructed model, the median OS was 59.8 months for low-risk ICC patients and 10.1 months for high-risk patients (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: The clinical-radiomics model integrating sarcopenia, clinical features, and radiomics score was accurate for prognostic prediction for mass-forming ICC patients. It provided an individualized prognostic evaluation in patients with mass-forming ICC and could helped surgeons with clinical decision-making.","Liming Deng,Liming Deng,Bin Chen,Bo Chen,Chenyi Zhan,Chenyi Zhan,Haitao Yu,Jiuyi Zheng,Haitao Yu,Wenming Bao,Jiu-Yi Zheng,Tuo Deng,Wenming Bao,Zheng Cheng,Tuo Deng,Lijun Wu,Chongming Zheng,Lijun Wu,Yunjun Yang,Yunjun Yang,Zhengping Yu,Yu Wang,Zhengping Yu,Yi Wang,Yi Wang,Gang Chen,Gang Chen",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0

10.1007/s10278-021-00527-1,34724143.0,,Biomedical Ontologies to Guide AI Development in Radiology.,"The advent of deep learning has engendered renewed and rapidly growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology to analyze images, manipulate textual reports, and plan interventions. Applications of deep learning and other AI approaches must be guided by sound medical knowledge to assure that they are developed successfully and that they address important problems in biomedical research or patient care. To date, AI has been applied to a limited number of real-world radiology applications. As AI systems become more pervasive and are applied more broadly, they will benefit from medical knowledge on a larger scale, such as that available through computer-based approaches. A key approach to represent computer-based knowledge in a particular domain is an ontology. As defined in informatics, an ontology defines a domain's terms through their relationships with other terms in the ontology. Those relationships, then, define the terms' semantics, or ""meaning."" Biomedical ontologies commonly define the relationships between terms and more general terms, and can express causal, part-whole, and anatomic relationships. Ontologies express knowledge in a form that is both human-readable and machine-computable. Some ontologies, such as RSNA's RadLex radiology lexicon, have been applied to applications in clinical practice and research, and may be familiar to many radiologists. This article describes how ontologies can support research and guide emerging applications of AI in radiology, including natural language processing, image-based machine learning, radiomics, and planning.","Ross W.

Methods From January 2014 to December 2018, 282 patients with lung cancer who had undergone enhanced CT scans and Ki-67 examination within 2 weeks were retrospectively enrolled and analyzed. The clinical data of the patients were collected, such as age, sex, smoking history, maximum tumor diameter and serum tumor markers. Our primary cohort was randomly divided into a training group (n=197) and a validation group (n=85) at a 7:3 ratio. A Ki-67 index ≤ 40% indicated low expression, and a Ki-67 index > 40% indicated high expression. In total, 396 radiomics features were extracted using AK software. Feature reduction and selection were performed using the lasso regression model. Logistic regression analysis was used to establish a multivariate predictive model to identify high and low Ki-67 expression in lung cancer. A nomogram integrating the radiomics score was established based on multiple logistic regression analysis.Area under the curve（AUC）was used to evaluate the prediction efficiency of the radiomics signature and nomogram.

Multiple medical literature archives (PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE) were systematically searched to retrieve original studies focused on cardiac MRI and CT radiomics applications. Two researchers in consensus assessed each investigation using the radiomics quality score (RQS). Subgroup analyses were performed to assess whether the total RQS varied according to study aim, journal quartile, imaging modality, and first author category. From a total of 1961 items, 53 articles were finally included in the analysis. Overall, the studies reached a median total RQS of 7 (IQR, 4–12), corresponding to a percentage score of 19.4% (IQR, 11.1–33.3%). Item scores were particularly low due to lack of prospective design, cost-effectiveness analysis, and open science. Median RQS percentage score was significantly higher in papers where the first author was a medical doctor and in those published on first quartile journals. The overall methodological quality of radiomics studies in cardiac MRI and CT is still lacking.

10.3390/biom11111659,,,Comparison of Conventional and Radiomic Features between 18F-FBPA PET/CT and PET/MR,"Boron-10-containing positron emission tomography (PET) radio-tracer, 18F-FBPA, has been used to evaluate the feasibility and treatment outcomes of Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). The clinical use of PET/MR is increasing and reveals its benefit in certain applications. However, the PET/CT is still the most widely used modality for daily PET practice due to its high quantitative accuracy and relatively low cost. Considering the different attenuation correction maps between PET/CT and PET/MR, comparison of derived image features from these two modalities is critical to identify quantitative imaging biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. This study aimed to investigate the comparability of image features extracted from 18F-FBPA PET/CT and PET/MR. A total of 15 patients with malignant brain tumor who underwent 18F-FBPA examinations using both PET/CT and PET/MR on the same day were retrospectively analyzed. Overall, four conventional imaging characteristics and 449 radiomic features were calculated from PET/CT and PET/MR, respectively. A linear regression model and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were estimated to evaluate the comparability of derived features between two modalities. Features were classified into strong, moderate, and weak comparability based on coefficient of determination (r2) and ICC. All of the conventional features, 81.2% of histogram, 37.5% of geometry, 51.5% of texture, and 25% of wavelet-based features, showed strong comparability between PET/CT and PET/MR. With regard to the wavelet filtering, radiomic features without filtering (61.2%) or with low-pass filtering (59.2%) along three axes produced strong comparability between the two modalities. However, only 8.2% of the features with high-pass filtering showed strong comparability. The linear regression models were provided for the features with strong and moderate consensus to interchange the quantitative features between the PET/CT and the PET/MR. All of the conventional and 71% of the radiomic (mostly histogram and texture) features were sufficiently stable and could be interchanged between 18F-FBPA PET with different hybrid modalities using the proposed equations. Our findings suggested that the image features high interchangeability may facilitate future studies in comparing PET/CT and PET/MR.","Chien-Yi Liao,Chien-Yi Liao,Jun-Hsuang Jen,Yiwei Chen,Yi Wei Chen,Jun-Hsuang Jen,Chien-Ying Li,Yi-Wei Chen,Yi-Wei Chen,Ling-Wei Wang,Chien-Ying Li,Ling-Wei Wang,Ling-Wei Wang,Ren-Shyan Liu,Ren-Shyan Liu,Wen‐Sheng Huang,Chia‐Feng Lu,Chia Feng Lu,Wen-Sheng Huang,Wen-Sheng Huang,Chia-Feng Lu",,2021.0

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been increasingly applied in the ablative treatment of thoracic tumors. This study aims to identify predictors of treatment responses in patients affected by early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pulmonary oligo-metastases treated with SBRT and to develop an accurate machine learning model to predict radiological response to SBRT.Computed tomography (CT) images of 85 tumors (stage I-II NSCLC and pulmonary oligo-metastases) from 69 patients treated with SBRT were analyzed. Gross tumor volumes (GTV) were contoured on CT images. Patients that achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were defined as responders. One hundred ten radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics module based on the GTV. The association of features with response to SBRT was evaluated. A model using support vector machine (SVM) was then trained to predict response based solely on the extracted radiomics features. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to evaluate model performance of the identified radiomic predictors.Sixty-nine patients receiving thoracic SBRT from 2008 to 2018 were retrospectively enrolled. Skewness and root mean squared were identified as radiomic predictors of response to SBRT. The SVM machine learning model developed had an accuracy of 74.8%. The area under curves for CR, PR, and non-responder prediction were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.794-0.921), 0.946 (95% CI, 0.873-0.978), and 0.857 (95% CI, 0.789-0.915), respectively.Radiomic analysis of pre-treatment CT scan is a promising tool that can predict tumor response to SBRT.","Ben M.

Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), a rare, multi-organ autoimmune disorder, have a similarly poor prognosis due to interstitial lung disease (ILD).  Objectives  To explore computed tomography (CT)-based high-dimensional image analysis (radiomics) for disease characterisation, risk stratification, and relaying information on lung pathophysiology in SSc-ILD.  Methods  We investigated two independent, prospectively followed SSc-ILD cohorts (Zurich, derivation cohort, n=90; Oslo, validation cohort, n=66). For every subject, we defined 1′355 robust radiomic features from standard-of-care CT images. We performed unsupervised clustering to identify and characterize imaging-based patient clusters. A clinically applicable prognostic quantitative radiomic risk score (qRISSc) for progression-free survival was derived from radiomic profiles using supervised analysis. The biological basis of qRISSc was assessed in a cross-species approach by correlation with lung proteomics, histological and gene expression data derived from mice with bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis.  Results  Radiomic profiling identified two clinically and prognostically distinct SSc-ILD patient clusters. To evaluate the clinical applicability, we derived and externally validated a binary, quantitative radiomic risk score composed of 26 features, qRISSc, that accurately predicted progression-free survival and significantly improved upon clinical risk stratification parameters in multivariable Cox regression analyses in the pooled cohorts. A high qRISSc score, which identifies patients at risk for progression, was reverse translatable from human to experimental ILD and correlated with fibrotic pathway activation.  Conclusions  Radiomics-based risk stratification using routine CT images provides complementary phenotypic, clinical and prognostic information significantly impacting clinical decision-making in SSc-ILD.","Janine Schniering,Małgorzata Maciukiewicz,Janine Schniering,Hubert S.

We aim to propose a mathematical model of space-filling curve-based spatial correspondence mapping to interpret intra-tumoral spatial locality and heterogeneity. METHODS A Hilbert curve-based approach was employed to decode and visualize intra-tumoral spatial heterogeneity by expanding the tumor volume to a two-dimensional (2D) matrix in voxels while preserving the spatial locality of the neighboring voxels. The proposed method was validated using three-dimensional (3D) volumes constructed from lung nodules from the LIDC-IDRI dataset, regular axial plane images, and 3D blocks. RESULTS Dimensionality reduction of the Hilbert volume with a single regular axial plane image showed a sparse and scattered pixel distribution on the corresponding 2D matrix. However, for 3D blocks and lung tumor inside the volume, the dimensionality reduction to the 2D matrix indicated regular and concentrated squares and rectangles. For classification into benign and malignant masses using lung nodules from the LIDC-IDRI dataset, the Inception-V4 indicated that the Hilbert matrix images improved accuracy (85.54% vs. 73.22%, p<0.001) compared to the original CT images of the test dataset. CONCLUSIONS Our study indicates that Hilbert curve-based spatial correspondence mapping is promising for decoding intra-tumoral spatial heterogeneity of partial or whole tumor samples on radiological images. This spatial-locality-preserving approach for voxel expansion enables existing radiomics and convolution neural networks to filter structured and spatially correlated high-dimensional intra-tumoral heterogeneity.","Lu Wang,Lu Wang,Nan‐Jie Xu,Lu Wang,Jiangdian Song,Nan Xu,Jiangdian Song,Jiangdian Song",Insights Into Imaging,2021.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was conducted using an abdominal phantom with liver nodules. We developed an image conversion algorithm using a residual feature aggregation network to reproduce radiomics features with CT images under various CT protocols and reconstruction kernels. External validation was performed using images from different scanners, consisting of 8 different protocols. To evaluate the variability of radiomics features, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn by targeting the liver parenchyma, vessels, paraspinal area, and liver nodules. We extracted 18 first-order, 68 second-order, and 688 wavelet radiomics features. Measurement variability was assessed using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), compared with the ground-truth image. RESULTS In the ROI-based analysis, there was an 83.3% improvement of CCC (80/96; 4 ROIs with 3 categories of radiomics features and 8 protocols) in synthetic images compared with the original images. Among them, the 56 CCC pairs showed a significant increase after image synthesis. In the radiomics feature-based analysis, 62.0% (3838 of 6192; 774 radiomics features with 8 protocols) features showed increased CCC after image synthesis, and a significant increase was noted in 26.9% (1663 of 6192) features. In particular, the first-order feature (79.9%, 115/144) showed better improvement in terms of the reproducibility of radiomics feature than the second-order (59.9%, 326/544) or wavelet feature (61.7%, 3397/5504). CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that a deep learning model for image conversion can improve the reproducibility of radiomics features across various CT protocols, reconstruction kernels, and CT scanners.","Tae Jin Yun,Seul Bi Lee,Yeon Jin Cho,Seul Bi Lee,Yong Woo Hong,Yeon Jin Cho,Dawun Jeong,Youngtaek Hong,Dawun Jeong,Jina Lee,Jin A Lee,Soohyun Kim,Seung–Hyun Lee,Soo-Hyun Kim,Seunghyun Lee,Young Hun Choi,Young Hun Choi",Investigative Radiology,2021.0
10.3389/fonc.2021.740111,,,Development and Validation of a Radiomics Model Based on 18F-FDG PET of Primary Gastric Cancer for Predicting Peritoneal Metastasis,"Abstract Objectives: This study aimed to develop a preoperative positron emission tomography (PET)-based radiomics model for predicting peritoneal metastasis (PM) of gastric cancer（GC）. Methods: The preoperative fluorine-18-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET images of 355 patients (109PM+, 246PM-) confirmed by histopathological examination were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were randomly divided into training set and validation set according to 7:3 ratio. Radiomics features and relevant data were extracted from PET images. The radiomics scores based on radiomics features, were built by logistic regression after using maximum relevance and minimum redundancy (mRMR) and least shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. The performance of the models was determined by their discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness in the training and validation sets. Results: After dimensionality reduction,12 radiomics feature parameters were obtained to construct radiomics signatures. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only carbohydrate antigen 125(CA125), maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and the radiomics signature had statistically significant differences between patients with and without PM (P<0.05). A radiomics model was developed based on the logistic analyses with AUC of 0.86 in the training set and 0.87 in the validation set. The clinical prediction model based on CA125 was 0.76 in the training set and 0.69 in the validation set. The comprehensive model contained rad-score and clinical factor (CA125) as well as metabolic parameter (SUVmax) showed the best performance with AUC of 0.90 in the training set and 0.88 in the validation set. The calibration curve demonstrated good consistency between the nomogram-predicted probability of PM and the actual rate. The Decision curve analysis (DCA) also confirmed the clinical utility of the nomogram. Conclusions: The comprehensive model based on rad-score and other factors (SUVmax, CA125) can make a meaningful contribution for predicting PM status in GC patients preoperatively.","Beihui Xue,Beihui Xue,Jia Jiang,Jia Jiang,Lei Chen,Lei Chen,Sunjie Wu,Xuan Zheng,Sunjie Wu,Xiujuan Zheng,Xuan Zheng,Xiangwu Zheng,Kun Tang,Kun Tang,Kun Tang",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0

To evaluate the utility of radiomics features in differentiating central lung cancers and atelectasis on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images. This study is retrospective. Materials and Methods. In this study, 36 patients with central pulmonary cancer and atelectasis between July 2013 and June 2018 were identified. A total of 1,653 2D and 2,327 3D radiomics features were extracted from segmented lung cancers and atelectasis on contrast-enhanced CT. The refined features were investigated for usefulness in classifying lung cancer and atelectasis according to the information gain, and 10 models were trained based on these features. The classification model is trained and tested at the region level and pixel level, respectively. Results. Among all the extracted features, 334 2D features and 1,507 3D features had an information gain (IG) greater than 0.1. The highest accuracy (AC) of the region classifiers was 0.9375. The best Dice score, Hausdorff distance, and voxel AC were 0.2076, 45.28, and 0.8675, respectively. Conclusions.

10.3389/fmed.2021.748144,,,Differentiation of Brain Abscess From Cystic Glioma Using Conventional MRI Based on Deep Transfer Learning Features and Hand-Crafted Radiomics Features,"Objectives: To develop and validate the model of combining deep transfer learning (DTL) features and hand-crafted radiomics (HCR) features for the differentiation of brain abscess from cystic glioma in conventional T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). Methods: This single-center retrospective analysis included 188 patients with pathologically proven brain abscess or cystic glioma. 1000 DTL and 105 HCR features were extracted from the T1WI and T2WI of each patient. Cross-combination of three feature selection methods and four classifiers, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest classiﬁer (RFC), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM), were compared to differentiate brain abscess from cystic glioma. The best method of combination of feature selection and classiﬁer was chosen. Results: In most cases, deep learning-based radiomics (DLR) features, i.e., DTL features combined with HCR features, demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy than HCR and DTL features alone for differentiating brain abscesses from cystic gliomas. The AUC of models based on DLR features in T2WI were 0.86 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.91) in the training cohort and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.95) in the test cohort, respectively. Conclusion: Differentiation of brain abscess from cystic glioma can be predicted efﬁciently by the DLR model, providing a useful, inexpensive, convenient, and noninvasive strategy for differential diagnosis. More importantly, this is the first time that conventional MR imaging radiomics has been used to identify these diseases. Also, we have combined HCR and DTL features to get more impressive performance.","Linlin Bo,Linlin Bo,Zijian Zhang,Zekun Jiang,Zijian Zhang,Zekun Jiang,Chia-Han Yang,Zekun Jiang,Pu Huang,Chao Yang,Pu Huang,Tingyin Chen,Yifan Wang,Tingyin Chen,Gang Yu,Yifan Wang,Xiao Jian Tan,Gang Yu,Xiao Tan,Quan Cheng,Quan Cheng,Dengwang Li,Dengwang Li,Zhixiong Liu,Zhixiong Liu",Frontiers of Medicine in China,2021.0
10.1088/1361-6560/ac39e5,34781280.0,,Evaluation of conventional and deep learning based image harmonization methods in radiomics studies.,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of image harmonization on outcome prediction models using radiomics. APPROACH 234 patients from the Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS) dataset with T1 MRI were enrolled in this study. Images were harmonized through a reference image using histogram matching (HHM) and a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method (HGAN). 88 radiomics features were extracted on HHM, HGAN and original (HNONE) images. Wilcoxon paired test was used to identify features significantly impacted by the harmonization protocol used. Radiomic prediction models were built using feature selection with the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Kaplan-Meier analysis. MAIN RESULTS More than 50% of the features (49/88) were statistically modified by the harmonization with HHM and 55 with HGAN (adjusted p-value < 0.05). The contribution of histogram and texture features selected by the LASSO, in comparison to shape features that were not impacted by harmonization, was higher in harmonized datasets (47% for Hnone, 62% for HHM and 71% for HGAN). Both image-based harmonization methods allowed to split patients into two groups with significantly different survival (p<0.05). With the HGAN images, we were also able to build and validate a model using only features impacted by the harmonization (median survivals of 189 vs. 437 days, p=0.006) Significance: Data harmonization in a multi-institutional cohort allows to recover the predictive value of some radiomics features that was lost due to differences in the image properties across centers. In terms of ability to build survival prediction models in the BRATS dataset, the loss of power from impacted histogram and heterogeneity features was compensated by the selection of additional shape features. The harmonization using a GAN-based approach outperformed the histogram matching technique, supporting the interest for the development of new advanced harmonization techniques for radiomic analysis purposes.","Florent Tixier,Florent Tixier,Vincent Jaouen,Clément Hognon,Vincent Jaouen,Olivier Gallinato,Clément Hognon,Thierry Colin,Olivier Gallinato,Thierry Colin,Dimitris Visvikis,Dimitris Visvikis",Physics in Medicine and Biology,2021.0
10.3389/fonc.2021.704607,,,Exploring CT Texture Parameters as Predictive and Response Imaging Biomarkers of Survival in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma Treated With PD-1 Inhibitor Nivolumab: A Pilot Study Using a Delta-Radiomics Approach,"In the era of artificial intelligence and precision medicine, the use of quantitative imaging methodological approaches could improve the cancer patient's therapeutic approaches. Specifically, our pilot study aims to explore whether CT texture features on both baseline and first post-treatment contrast-enhanced CT, may act as a predictor of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in metastatic melanoma (MM) patients treated with PD-1 inhibitor Nivolumab. 94 lesions from 32 patients treated with Nivolumab were analyzed. Segmentation of the regions of interest (ROI) around the lesions was performed on CT. Radiomic features were extracted from each ROI lesion using texture analysis software. Percentage changes in texture features were calculated to perform delta-radiomics analysis. Texture feature kurtosis at fine and medium filter scale predicted OS and PFS. A higher kurtosis is correlated with good prognosis; kurtosis values greater than 1.11 for SSF=2 and 1.20 for SSF=3 were indicators of higher OS and PFS. In delta-radiomics analysis, the entropy percentage variation correlated with OS and PFS. Increasing entropy indicates a worse outcome. An entropy variation greater than 5% was an indicator of bad prognosis. CT delta-texture analysis quantified as entropy predicted OS and PFS. Baseline CT texture quantified as kurtosis also predicted survival baseline. Further studies with larger cohorts are mandatory to confirm these promising exploratory results.","Antonino Guerrisi,Antonino Guerrisi,Michelangelo Russillo,Emiliano Loi,Michelangelo Russillo,Balaji Ganeshan,Emiliano Loi,Sara Ungania,Balaji Ganeshan,S.

10.1002/mp.15341,34766623.0,,FMRNet: A fused network of multiple tumoral-regions for breast tumor classification with ultrasound images,"PURPOSE Recent studies have illustrated that the peritumoral regions of medical images have value for clinical diagnosis. However, the existing approaches using peritumoral regions mainly focus on the diagnostic capability of the single region and ignore the advantages of effectively fusing the intratumoral and peritumoral regions. In addition, these methods need accurate segmentation masks in the testing stage, which are tedious and inconvenient in clinical applications. To address these issues, we construct a deep convolutional neural network that can adaptively fuse the information of multiple tumoral-regions (FMRNet) for breast tumor classification using ultrasound (US) images without segmentation masks in the testing stage. METHODS To sufficiently excavate the potential relationship, we design a fused network and two independent modules to extract and fuse features of multiple regions simultaneously. First, we introduce two enhanced combined-tumoral (EC) region modules, aiming to enhance the combined-tumoral features gradually. Then we further design a three-branch module for extracting and fusing the features of intratumoral, peritumoral, and combined-tumoral regions, denoted as the IPC module. Especially, we design a novel fusion module by introducing a channel attention module to adaptively fuse the features of three regions. The model is evaluated on two public datasets including UDIAT and BUSI with breast tumor ultrasound images. Two independent groups of experiments are performed on two respective datasets using the five-fold stratified cross-validation strategy. Finally, we conduct ablation experiments on two datasets, in which BUSI is used as the training set and UDIAT is used as the testing set. RESULTS We conduct detailed ablation experiments about the proposed two modules and comparative experiments with other existing representative methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields state-of-the-art performance on both two datasets. Especially, in the UDIAT dataset, the proposed FMRNet achieves a high accuracy of 0.945 and a specificity of 0.945 respectively. Moreover, the precision (PRE = 0.909) even dramatically improves by 21.6% on the BUSI dataset compared with the existing method of the best result. CONCLUSION The proposed FMRNet shows good performance in breast tumor classification with US images, and proves its capability of exploiting and fusing the information of multiple tumoral-regions. Furthermore, the FMRNet has potential value in classifying other types of cancers using multiple tumoral-regions of other kinds of medical images. This article is protected by copyright.

Methods  This study retrospectively collected 177 patients with pathologically proven ccRCC (124 low-grade; 53 high-grade). Tumor VOI was manually segmented, followed by artificially introducing uncertainties as: (i) contour-focused VOI, (ii) margin erosion of 2 or 4 mm, and (iii) margin dilation (2, 4, or 6 mm) inclusive of perirenal fat, peritumoral renal parenchyma, or both. Radiomics features were extracted from four-phase CT images (unenhanced phase (UP), corticomedullary phase (CMP), nephrographic phase (NP), excretory phase (EP)). Different combinations of four-phasic features for each VOI delineation strategy were used to build 176 classification models. The best VOI delineation strategy and superior CT phase were identified and the top-ranked features were analyzed.  Results  Features extracted from UP and EP outperformed features from other single/combined phase(s). Shape features and first-order statistics features exhibited superior discrimination. The best performance (ACC 81%, SEN 67%, SPE 87%, AUC 0.87) was achieved with radiomics features extracted from UP and EP based on contour-focused VOI.  Conclusion  Shape and first-order features extracted from UP + EP images are better feature representations. Contour-focused VOI erosion by 2 mm or dilation by 4 mm within peritumor renal parenchyma exerts limited impact on discriminative performance. It provides a reference for segmentation tolerance in radiomics-based modeling for ccRCC nuclear grading.  Key points  • Lesion delineation uncertainties are tolerated within a VOI erosion range of 2 mm or dilation range of 4 mm within peritumor renal parenchyma for radiomics-based ccRCC nuclear grading. • Radiomics features extracted from unenhanced phase and excretory phase are superior to other single/combined phase(s) at differentiating high vs low nuclear grade ccRCC. • Shape features and first-order statistics features showed superior discriminative capability compared to texture features.","Sanzhong Luo,Shiwei Luo,Ruili Wei,Ruili Wei,Shuguang Lu,Songlin Lu,Shih‐Wei Lai,Jialiang Wu,Shengsheng Lai,Zhe Wu,Jialiang Wu,Zhe Wu,Xinrui Pang,Xinrui Pang,Xinhua Wei,Xinqing Jiang,Xinhua Wei,Xinqing Jiang,Xin Zhen,Ruimeng Yang,Xin Zhen,Ruimeng Yang",European Radiology,2021.0
10.1007/978-3-030-89847-2_6,,,Fully Automatic Head and Neck Cancer Prognosis Prediction in PET/CT,"Several recent PET/CT radiomics studies have shown promising results for the prediction of patient outcomes in Head and Neck (H&N) cancer. These studies, however, are most often conducted on relatively small cohorts (up to 300 patients) and using manually delineated tumors. Recently, deep learning reached high performance in the automatic segmentation of H&N primary tumors in PET/CT. The automatic segmentation could be used to validate these studies on larger-scale cohorts while obviating the burden of manual delineation. We propose a complete PET/CT processing pipeline gathering the automatic segmentation of primary tumors and prognosis prediction of patients with H&N cancer treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Automatic contours of the primary Gross Tumor Volume (GTVt) are obtained from a 3D UNet. A radiomics pipeline that automatically predicts the patient outcome (Disease Free Survival, DFS) is compared when using either the automatically or the manually annotated contours. In addition, we extract deep features from the bottleneck layers of the 3D UNet to compare them with standard radiomics features (first- and second-order as well as shape features) and to test the performance gain when added to them. The models are evaluated on the HECKTOR 2020 dataset consisting of 239 H&N patients with PET, CT, GTVt contours and DFS data available (five centers). Regarding the results, using Hand-Crafted (HC) radiomics features extracted from manual GTVt achieved the best performance and is associated with an average Concordance (C) index of 0.672. The fully automatic pipeline (including deep and HC features from automatic GTVt) achieved an average C index of 0.626, which is lower but relatively close to using manual GTVt (p-value = 0.20). This suggests that large-scale studies could be conducted using a fully automatic pipeline to further validate the current state of the art H&N radiomics. The code will be shared publicly for reproducibility.","Pierre Fontaine,Vincent Andrearczyk,Pierre Fontaine,Vincent Andrearczyk,Valentin Oreiller,J.

The field of medicine and medical imaging, as one of its various specialties, has gained considerable benefit from AI, including improved diagnostic accuracy and the possibility of predicting individual patient outcomes and options of more personalized treatment. It should be noted that this process can actively support the ongoing development of advanced, highly specific treatment strategies (e.g., target therapies for cancer patients) while enabling faster workflow and more efficient use of healthcare resources. The potential advantages of AI over conventional methods have made it attractive for physicians and other healthcare stakeholders, raising much interest in both the research and the industry communities. However, the fast development of AI has unveiled its potential for disrupting the work of healthcare professionals, spawning concerns among radiologists that, in the future, AI may outperform them, thus damaging their reputations or putting their jobs at risk. Furthermore, this development has raised relevant psychological, ethical, and medico-legal issues which need to be addressed for AI to be considered fully capable of patient management.

10.1007/978-3-030-87196-3_4,,,Imbalance-Aware Self-supervised Learning for 3D Radiomic Representations,"Radiomics can quantify the properties of regions of interest in medical image data. Classically, they account for pre-defined statistics of shape, texture, and other low-level image features. Alternatively, deep learning-based representations are derived from supervised learning but require expensive annotations and often suffer from overfitting and data imbalance issues. In this work, we address the challenge of learning the representation of a 3D medical image for an effective quantification under data imbalance. We propose a self-supervised representation learning framework to learn high-level features of 3D volumes as a complement to existing radiomics features. Specifically, we demonstrate how to learn image representations in a self-supervised fashion using a 3D Siamese network. More importantly, we deal with data imbalance by exploiting two unsupervised strategies: a) sample re-weighting, and b) balancing the composition of training batches. When combining the learned self-supervised feature with traditional radiomics, we show significant improvement in brain tumor classification and lung cancer staging tasks covering MRI and CT imaging modalities.

10.2967/jnumed.121.262618,34711618.0,,Improved Prognosis of Treatment Failure in Cervical Cancer with Non-Tumor Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography Radiomics.,"Background: Radiomics has been applied to predict recurrence in several disease sites, but current approaches are typically restricted to analyzing tumor features, neglecting non-tumor information in the rest of the body. The purpose of this work was to develop and validate a model incorporating non-tumor radiomics, including whole body features, to predict treatment outcomes in patients with previously untreated locoregionally advanced cervical cancer.Methods: We analyzed 127 cervical cancer patients treated definitively with chemoradiotherapy and intracavitary brachytherapy. All patients underwent pretreatment whole body 18F-FDG PET/CT. To quantify effects due to the tumor itself, the gross tumor volume (GTV) was directly contoured on the PET/CT. Meanwhile, to quantify effects arising from the rest of the body, the planning target volume (PTV) was deformably registered from each planning CT to the PET/CT, and a semi-automated approach combining seed-growing and manual contour review generated whole body muscle, bone, and fat segmentations on each PET/CT. A total of 965 radiomic features were extracted for GTV, PTV, muscle, bone, and fat. 95 patients were used to train a Cox model of disease recurrence including both radiomic and clinical features (age, stage, tumor grade, histology, and baseline complete blood cell counts), using bagging and split-sample-validation for feature reduction and model selection. To further avoid overfitting, the resulting models were tested for generalization on the remaining 32 patients, by calculating a risk score based on Cox regression and evaluating the c-index (c-index > 0.5 indicates predictive power). Results: Optimal performance was seen in a Cox model including one clinical biomarker (whether or not a tumor was stage III-IVA), two GTV radiomic biomarkers (PET gray-level size-zone matrix small area low gray level emphasis and zone entropy), one PTV radiomic biomarker (major axis length) and one whole body radiomic biomarker (CT Bone root mean square). In particular, stratification into high- and low-risk groups, based on the linear risk score from this Cox model, resulted in a hazard ratio [95% CI] of 0.019 [0.004, 0.082], an improvement over stratification based on clinical stage alone, which had a hazard ratio of 0.36 [0.16, 0.83]. Conclusion: Incorporating non-tumor radiomic biomarkers can improve the performance of prognostic models compared to using only clinical and tumor radiomic biomarkers. Future work should look to further test these models in larger, multi-institutional cohorts.","Tahir Yusufaly,Tahir Yusufaly,Jingjing Zou,Tyler J. Nelson,Jingjing Zou,Casey W.

A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND OncotypeDX® recurrence score (RS) aids therapeutic decision-making in oestrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. Radiomics is an evolving field that aims to examine the relationship between radiological features and the underlying genomic landscape of disease processes. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of current evidence evaluating the comparability of radiomics and RS. METHODS A systematic review was performed as per PRISMA guidelines. Studies comparing radiomic MRI tumour analyses and RS were identified. Sensitivity, specificity and area under curve (AUC) delineating low risk (RS less than 18) versus intermediate-high risk (equal to or greater than 18) and low-intermediate risk (RS less than 30) and high risk (RS greater than 30) were recorded. Log rate ratios (lnRR) and standard error were determined from AUC and 95 per cent confidence intervals. RESULTS Nine studies including 1216 patients met inclusion criteria; the mean age at diagnosis was 52.9 years. Mean RS was 16 (range 0-75); 401 patients with RS less than 18, 287 patients with RS 18-30 and 100 patients with RS greater than 30. Radiomic analysis and RS were comparable for differentiating RS less than 18 versus RS 18 or greater (RR 0.93 (95 per cent c.i. 0.85 to 1.01); P = 0.010, heterogeneity (I2)=0%) as well as RS less than 30 versus RS 30 or greater (RR 0.76 (95 per cent c.i. 0.70 to 0.83); P < 0.001, I2=0%). MRI sensitivity and specificity for RS less than 18 versus 18 or greater was 0.89 (95 per cent c.i. 0.85 to 0.93) and 0.72 (95 per cent c.i. 0.66 to 0.78) respectively, and 0.79 (95 per cent c.i. 0.72 to 0.86) and 0.74 (95 per cent c.i. 0.68 to 0.80) for RS less than 30 versus 30 or greater.

The institutional database was reviewed to identify patients with pHGGs with a midline location of the brain who underwent tumor biopsy with preoperative MRI scans between June 2016 and June 2021. A total of 107 patients with pHGGs, including 79 patients with H3K27M mutation, were consecutively included and randomly divided into training and test sets. Radiomics features were extracted from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion-weighted (DW) and post-contrast T1-weighted images, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression were performed for radiomics signature construction. Clinical and radiological features were analyzed to select clinical predictors. A nomogram was then developed by incorporating the radiomics signature and selected clinical predictors. Nine radiomics features were selected to construct the radiomics signature, which showed a favorable discriminatory ability in training and test sets with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 and 0.92, respectively. Ring enhancement was identified as an independent clinical predictor (p<0.01). The nomogram, constructed with radiomics signature and ring enhancement, showed good calibration and discrimination in training and testing sets (AUC: 0.95 and 0.90 respectively). The nomogram which combined radiomics signature and ring enhancement had a satisfactory ability to predict H3K27M mutation in pHGGs with a midline of the brain. • Conventional MRI features were not powerful enough to predict H3K27M mutation status in pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs) with a midline location of the brain. • An MRI-based radiomics signature showed satisfactory ability to predict H3K27M mutation status of pHGGs located in the midline of the brain. • Associating the radiomics signature with clinical factors improved predictive performance.","Chao Wu,Hui Zheng,Chenqing Wu,Jinning Li,Hui Zheng,Yuzhen Zhang,Jinning Li,Shaofeng Duan,Yuzhen Zhang,Yuhua Li,Shaofeng Duan,Yuhua Li,Dengbin Wang,Dengbin Wang",European Radiology,2021.0

Methods: 102 patients with osteosarcoma underwent NAC were enrolled in this study. All patients received a DCE-MRI scan before NAC. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) was used as the standard to evaluate the NAC response in effective and ineffective group. The following semi-quantitative parameters of DCE-MRI were calculated: early dynamic enhancement wash-in slope (Slope), time to peak (TTP), and enhancement rate (R). Variance Threshold, Univariate feature selection, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) were used to select optimal features. Three classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machin (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR)) were implemented for model establishment. The performance of different classifiers and semi-quantitative parameters was evaluated by confusion matrix and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves. Furthermore, clinically relevant risk factors including age, tumor size and site, pathological fracture, and surgical staging were collected. The selected clinical features and imaging features were combined to establish the model and the Nomogram, and then the predictive efficacy was evaluated. Results: Clinical relevance risk factor analysis demonstrates that only surgical stage was an independent predictor of NAC. A total of 7 radiomic features were selected, and three machine learning models (KNN, SVM, and LR) were established based on such features. Prediction accuracy (ACC) of these 3 models was 0.89, 0.84, and 0.84, respectively. And the area under the subject curve (AUC) of these 3 models was 0.86, 0.92, and 0.93 respectively. As for Slope, TTP, and R parameters, the prediction ACC was 0.91, 0.89, and 0.81, respectively; while the AUC was 0.87, 0.85, and 0.83, respectively. In both the training and testing sets, the ACC and AUC of the combined model were higher than those of the radiomics models (ACC = 0.91 and AUC = 0.95), which indicates outstanding performance of proposed model. Conclusions: The radiomics nomogram demonstrates satisfactory predictive results for treatment response of patients with osteosarcoma before NAC. This finding may provide a new decision basis to improve the treatment plan.","Lu Zhang,Yinghui Ge,Lu Zhang,Qiuru Gao,Yinghui Ge,Fei Zhao,Qiuru Gao,Tianming Cheng,Fei Zhao,Tianming Cheng,Hailiang Li,Yuwei Xia,Hailiang Li,Yuwei Xia",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0

However, when predicting the pathologic complete response (pCR) after nCRT for rectal cancer, existing works either rely on simple quantitative evaluation based on radiomics features or partially analyze multi-parametric MRI. We propose an effective pCR prediction method based on novel multi-parametric MRI embedding. We first seek to extract volumetric features of tumors that can be found only by analyzing multiple MRI sequences jointly. Specifically, we encapsulate multiple MRI sequences into multi-sequence fusion images (MSFI) and generate MSFI embedding. We merge radiomics features, which capture important characteristics of tumors, with MSFI embedding to generate multi-parametric MRI embedding and then use it to predict pCR using a random forest classifier. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that using all given MRI sequences is the most effective regardless of the dimension reduction method. The proposed method outperformed any variants with different combinations of feature vectors and dimension reduction methods or different classification models. Comparative experiments demonstrate that it outperformed four competing baselines in terms of the AUC and F1-score. We use MRI sequences from 912 patients with rectal cancer, a much larger sample than in any existing work.","Seunghyun Lee,Seung-Hyun Lee,Joon Seok Lim,Jaeseung Shin,Joon Seok Lim,Sungwon Kim,Jaeseung Shin,Do Young Kim,Heasoo Hwang,Sung-Won Kim,Heasoo Hwang",Applied Sciences,2021.0

Our study aims to find an answer to a clinically relevant question: is there a radiomic profile that can identify glioblastoma (GBM) patients with short-term survival after complete tumor resection? A retrospective study of GBM patients who underwent surgery was conducted in two institutions between January 2019 and January 2020, along with cases from public databases. Cases with gross total or near total tumor resection were included. Preoperative structural multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) sequences were pre-processed, and a total of 15,720 radiomic features were extracted. After feature reduction, machine learning-based classifiers were used to predict early mortality (<6 months). Additionally, a survival analysis was performed using the random survival forest (RSF) algorithm. A total of 203 patients were enrolled in this study. In the classification task, the naive Bayes classifier obtained the best results in the test data set, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.769 and classification accuracy of 80%. The RSF model allowed the stratification of patients into low- and high-risk groups. In the test data set, this model obtained values of C-Index = 0.61, IBS = 0.123 and integrated AUC at six months of 0.761. In this study, we developed a reliable predictive model of short-term survival in GBM by applying open-source and user-friendly computational means.

10.1186/s40644-021-00425-3,34627393.0,,Predicting microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma: a deep learning model validated across hospitals.,"BACKGROUND The accuracy of estimating microvascular invasion (MVI) preoperatively in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by clinical observers is low. Most recent studies constructed MVI predictive models utilizing radiological and/or radiomics features extracted from computed tomography (CT) images. These methods, however, rely heavily on human experiences and require manual tumor contouring. We developed a deep learning-based framework for preoperative MVI prediction by using CT images of arterial phase (AP) with simple tumor labeling and without the need of manual feature extraction. The model was further validated on CT images that were originally scanned at multiple different hospitals. METHODS CT images of AP were acquired for 309 patients from China Medical University Hospital (CMUH). Images of 164 patients, who took their CT scanning at 54 different hospitals but were referred to CMUH, were also collected. Deep learning (ResNet-18) and machine learning (support vector machine) models were constructed with AP images and/or patients' clinical factors (CFs), and their performance was compared systematically. All models were independently evaluated on two patient cohorts: validation set (within CMUH) and external set (other hospitals). Subsequently, explainability of the best model was visualized using gradient-weighted class activation map (Grad-CAM). RESULTS The ResNet-18 model built with AP images and patients' clinical factors was superior than other models achieving a highest AUC of 0.845. When evaluating on the external set, the model produced an AUC of 0.777, approaching its performance on the validation set. Model interpretation with Grad-CAM revealed that MVI relevant imaging features on CT images were captured and learned by the ResNet-18 model. CONCLUSIONS This framework provide evidence showing the generalizability and robustness of ResNet-18 in predicting MVI using CT images of AP scanned at multiple different hospitals. Attention heatmaps obtained from model explainability further confirmed that ResNet-18 focused on imaging features on CT overlapping with the conditions used by radiologists to estimate MVI clinically.","Shucheng Liu,Jesyin Lai,Shu-Cheng Liu,Jesyin Lai,Jhao-Yu Huang,Chia-Fong Cho,Jhao-Yu Huang,Pei Hua Lee,Chia-Fong Cho,Pei Hua Lee,Min-Hsuan Lu,Chun-Chieh Yeh,Min-Hsuan Lu,Jiaxin Yu,Chun-Chieh Yeh,Jiaxin Yu,Wei-Che Lin,Wei-Ching Lin",Cancer Imaging,2021.0

METHODS From July 2017 to July 2020, 236 CHS patients with non-HE (n = 140) and MHE (n = 96) were retrospective collected and randomly divided into training group and testing group. Radiomics features were extracted from substantia nigra-striatum system of a brain diffusion weighted images (DWI) and combined with clinical predictors to build a radiomics nomogram for predicting MHE in CHS patients. The ROC curve was used to evaluate the predicting performance in training group and testing group. The clinical decisive curve (CDC) was used to assess the clinical net benefit of using radiomics nomogram in predicting MHE. RESULTS Low seralbumin (P < 0.05), low platelet count (P < 0.05) and high plasma ammonia (P < 0.05) was the significant clinical predictors for MHE in CHS patients. The AUC, specificity and sensitivity of the radiomics nomogram were 0.89, 0.90 and 0.86 in the training group, and were 0.83, 0.85 and 0.75 in the training group. The CDC analysis showed clinical net benefits for the radiomics nomogram in predicting MHE. CONCLUSIONS The radiomics nomogram combining DWI radiomics features and clinical predictors could be useful tool to predict MHE in CHS patients.","Ying Li,Shaoqing Ju,Ying Li,Shuai Ju,Xin Li,Xin Li,Yan Li Zhou,Jin Wei Qiang,Yan Li Zhou,Jin Wei Qiang",PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases,2021.0

Over the past decade, the management of lung cancer patients has radically improved, due to numerous breakthroughs in our understanding of lung cancer molecular characteristics, targeted and immunotherapies, and computer hardware and software. Among innovative technologies, quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIBs) have become promising tools to support clinical decision making. This indicates a paradigm shift, redefining medical images as a quantitative asset for data-driven precision medicine, rather than a qualitative method for estimating disease status.

Method: A retrospective review of 70 patients with breast invasive carcinomas proved by biopsy between June 2017 and October 2020 (26 patients were pathological complete response, and 44 patients were non-pathological complete response). Within the pre-contrast and five post-contrast dynamic series, a total of 1037 quantitative imaging features were extracted from in each phase. Additionally, the Δfeatures (the difference between the features before and after the comparison) were used for subsequent analysis. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method was used to select features related to pCR, and then use these features to train multiple machine learning classifiers to predict the probability of pCR for a given patient. The area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to assess the predictive performances of the radiomics model for each of the five phases of time points. Result: Among the five phases, each individual phase performed with AUCs ranging from 0.845 to 0.919 in predicting pCR. The best single phases performance was given by the 3rd phase (AUC = 0.919, sensitivity 0.885, specificity 0.864). 5 of the features have significant differences between pCR and non-pCR groups in each phase, most features reach their maximum or minimum in the 2nd or 3rd phase.

10.3390/cancers13225689,,,Radiomics Predicts for Distant Metastasis in Locally Advanced Human Papillomavirus-Positive Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"(1) Background and purpose: clinical trials have unsuccessfully tried to de-escalate treatment in locally advanced human papillomavirus positive (HPV+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) with the goal of reducing treatment toxicity. The aim of this study was to explore the role of radiomics for risk stratification in this patient population to guide treatment. (2) Methods: the study population consisted of 225 patients with locally advanced HPV+ OPSCC treated with curative-intent radiation or chemoradiation therapy. Appearance of distant metastasis was used as the endpoint event. Radiomics data were extracted from the gross tumor volumes (GTVs) identified on the planning CT, with gray level being discretized using three different bin widths (8, 16, and 32). The data extracted for the groups with and without distant metastasis were subsequently balanced using three different algorithms including synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE), adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN), and borderline SMOTE. From these different combinations, a total of nine radiomics datasets were derived. Top features that minimized redundancy while maximizing relevance to the endpoint were selected individually and collectively for the nine radiomics datasets to build support vector machine (SVM) based predictive classifiers. Performance of the developed classifiers was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. (3) Results: of the 225 locally advanced HPV+ OPSCC patients being studied, 9.3% had developed distant metastases at last follow-up. SVM classifiers built for the nine radiomics dataset using either their own respective top features or the top consensus ones were all able to differentiate the two cohorts at a level of excellence or beyond, with ROC area under curve (AUC) ranging from 0.84 to 0.95 (median = 0.90). ROC comparisons further revealed that the majority of the built classifiers did not distinguish the two cohorts significantly better than each other. (4) Conclusions: radiomics demonstrated discriminative ability in distinguishing patients with locally advanced HPV+ OPSCC who went on to develop distant metastasis after completion of definitive chemoradiation or radiation alone and may serve to risk stratify this patient population with the purpose of guiding the appropriate therapy.","Benjamin Rich,Benjamin Rich,Benjamin J.

Using a pretrained DL model through a radiomics-guided approach, we propose a methodology for stratifying the prognosis of lung adenocarcinomas based on pretreatment CT. Our approach allows us to apply DL with smaller sample size requirements and enhanced interpretability. Baseline radiomics and DL models for the prognosis of lung adenocarcinomas were developed and tested using local (n=617) cohort. The DL models were further tested in an external validation (n=70) cohort. The local cohort was divided into training and test cohorts. A radiomics risk score (RRS) was developed using Cox-LASSO. Three pretrained DL networks derived from natural images were used to extract the DL features. The features were further guided using radiomics by retaining those DL features whose correlations with the radiomics features were high and Bonferroni-corrected p-values were low. The retained DL features were subject to a Cox-LASSO when constructing DL risk scores (DRS). The risk groups stratified by the RRS and DRS showed a significant difference in training, testing, and validation cohorts. The DL features were interpreted using existing radiomics features, and the texture features explained the DL features well.

However, the lack of repeatability and reproducibility of radiomic features (RFs) may hinder their generalizability in clinical applications. OBJECTIVES The aims of this study were to explore 3 main sources of variability in RFs, investigate their influencing magnitudes and patterns, and identify a subset of robust RFs for further studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS A chest phantom with nodules was scanned with different computed tomography (CT) scanners repeatedly with varying acquisition and reconstruction parameters (April-May 2019) to evaluate 3 sources of variability: test-retest, inter-CT, and intra-CT protocol variability. The robustness of the RFs was measured using the concordance correlation coefficient, dynamic range, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The influencing magnitudes and patterns were analyzed using the Friedman test and Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Stable and informative RFs were selected, and their redundancy was eliminated using hierarchical clustering. Clinical validation was also performed to verify the clinical effectiveness and potential enhancement of the generalizability of radiomics research. RESULTS A total of 1295 RFs that showed all 3 sources of variability were included. The reconstruction kernel and the iteration level showed the greatest (ICC, 0.35 ± 0.31) and the least (ICC, 0.63 ± 0.27) influence on magnitudes. The different sources of variability showed relatively consistent patterns of influence (false discovery rate <0.001). Finally, we obtained a subset of 19 stable, informative, and nonredundant RFs under all 3 sources of variability. These RFs exhibited clinical effectiveness and showed better prediction performance than unstable RFs in the validation dataset (P = 0.017, Delong test). CONCLUSIONS The stability of RFs was affected to different degrees by test-retest and differences in CT manufacturers and models and CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters, but the influences of these factors showed relatively consistent patterns. We also obtained a subset of 19 stable, informative, and nonredundant RFs that should be preferably used to enhance the generalizability of further radiomics research.","Xueqing Peng,Shuyi Yang,Xueqing Peng,Lingxiao Zhou,Shuyi Yang,Lingxiao Zhou,Miao Yu,Lili Shi,Yu Mei,Lili Shi,Rengyin Zhang,Rengyin Zhang,Fei Shan,Fei Shan,Lei Liu,Lei Liu",Investigative Radiology,2021.0
10.1038/s41598-021-99701-2,34635786.0,,Robust imaging habitat computation using voxel-wise radiomics features.,"Tumor heterogeneity has been postulated as a hallmark of treatment resistance and a cure constraint in cancer patients. Conventional quantitative medical imaging (radiomics) can be extended to computing voxel-wise features and aggregating tumor subregions with similar radiological phenotypes (imaging habitats) to elucidate the distribution of tumor heterogeneity within and among tumors. Despite the promising applications of imaging habitats, they may be affected by variability of radiomics features, preventing comparison and generalization of imaging habitats techniques. We performed a comprehensive repeatability and reproducibility analysis of voxel-wise radiomics features in more than 500 lung cancer patients with computed tomography (CT) images and demonstrated the effect of voxel-wise radiomics variability on imaging habitats computation in 30 lung cancer patients with test-retest images. Repeatable voxel-wise features characterized texture heterogeneity and were reproducible regardless of the applied feature extraction parameters. Imaging habitats computed using robust radiomics features were more stable than those computed using all features in test-retest CTs from the same patient. Nine voxel-wise radiomics features (joint energy, joint entropy, sum entropy, maximum probability, difference entropy, Imc1, Imc2, Idn and Idmn) were repeatable and reproducible. This supports their application for computing imaging habitats in lung tumors towards the discovery of previously unseen tumor heterogeneity and the development of novel non-invasive imaging biomarkers for precision medicine.","Kinga Bernatowicz,K.

For each study, data were extracted for study characteristics, methodological quality, and accuracy. Discrepancies in screening and extraction were resolved by a third reviewer. Data were synthesized narratively. 15 studies were included, 13 of which were full reports, while two were conference abstracts. Overall, 3164 patients were enrolled with a total of 3379 LNs recorded (69% malignancy). Point estimate sensitivities for algorithms ranged from 52 to 99%, while specificity for the algorithms ranged from 60 to 92%. Area under the curve c-statistics were only reported for algorithms and not the clinician. Point estimate c-statistics ranged from 0.64 to 0.94, suggesting that the algorithms possessed good discrimination potentials. The current level of evidence of radiomic analysis methods for staging lung cancer is inconclusive and possesses heterogeneity in study design. Prospective external validation of these algorithms and direct comparisons using cut-off thresholds is required to determine their true predictive capability prior to implementation in clinical practice.

There are many articles that discuss AI from the viewpoint of nuclear medicine, but few focus on nuclear medicine from the viewpoint of AI. Nuclear medicine images are characterized by their low spatial resolution and high quantitativeness. It is noted that AI has been used since before the emergence of deep learning. AI can be divided into three categories by its purpose: (1) assisted interpretation, i.e., computer-aided detection (CADe) or computer-aided diagnosis (CADx). (2) Additional insight, i.e., AI provides information beyond the radiologist's eye, such as predicting genes and prognosis from images. It is also related to the field called radiomics/radiogenomics. (3) Augmented image, i.e., image generation tasks. To apply AI to practical use, harmonization between facilities and the possibility of black box explanations need to be resolved.","Kenji Hirata,Kenji Hirata,Hiroyuki Sugimori,Hiroyuki Sugimori,Noriyuki Fujima,Noriyuki Fujima,Takuya Toyonaga,Takuya Toyonaga,Kohsuke Kudo,Kohsuke Kudo",Annals of Nuclear Medicine,2022.0
10.3390/cancers14030477,,,Benchmarking Eliminative Radiomic Feature Selection for Head and Neck Lymph Node Classification,"In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) pathologic cervical lymph nodes (LN) remain important negative predictors. Current criteria for LN-classification in contrast-enhanced computed-tomography scans (contrast-CT) are shape-based; contrast-CT imagery allows extraction of additional quantitative data (""features""). The data-driven technique to extract, process, and analyze features from contrast-CTs is termed ""radiomics"". Extracted features from contrast-CTs at various levels are typically redundant and correlated. Current sets of features for LN-classification are too complex for clinical application. Effective eliminative feature selection (EFS) is a crucial preprocessing step to reduce the complexity of sets identified. We aimed at exploring EFS-algorithms for their potential to identify sets of features, which were as small as feasible and yet retained as much accuracy as possible for LN-classification. In this retrospective cohort-study, which adhered to the STROBE guidelines, in total 252 LNs were classified as ""non-pathologic"" (n = 70), ""pathologic"" (n = 182) or ""pathologic with extracapsular spread"" (n = 52) by two experienced head-and-neck radiologists based on established criteria which served as a reference. The combination of sparse discriminant analysis and genetic optimization retained up to 90% of the classification accuracy with only 10% of the original numbers of features. From a clinical perspective, the selected features appeared plausible and potentially capable of correctly classifying LNs. Both the identified EFS-algorithm and the identified features need further exploration to assess their potential to prospectively classify LNs in HNSCC.","Zoltán R.

Methods This retrospective analysis of a prospective study enrolled EC patients with stage cT1N + M0 or cT2-4aN0-3M0 who received DCE-MRI within 7 days before chemotherapy, followed by surgery. Response assessment was graded from 1 to 5 according to the tumor regression grade (TRG). Patients were stratified into responders (TRG1 + 2) and non-responders (TRG3 + 4 + 5). 72 radiomics features and vascular permeability parameters were extracted from DCE-MRI. The discriminating performance was assessed with ROC. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used for comparing three different models. Results This cohort included 82 patients, and 72 tumor radiomics features and vascular permeability parameters acquired from DCE-MRI. mRMR and LASSO were performed to choose the optimized subset of radiomics features, and 3 features were selected to create the radiomics signature that were significantly associated with response ( P &lt; 0.001). AUC of combining radiomics signature and DCE-MRI performance in the training (n = 41) and validation (n = 41) cohort was 0.84 (95% CI 0.57–1) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.74–0.97), respectively.

The key enabling tools currently in use in Precision, Digital and Translational Medicine, here named as 'Intelligent Systems' (IS), leverage unprecedented data volumes and aim to model their underlying heterogeneous influences and variables correlated with patients' outcomes. As functionality and performance of IS are associated with complex diagnosis and therapy decisions, a rich spectrum of patterns and features detected in high-dimensional data may be critical for inference purposes. Many challenges are also present in such discovery task. First, the generation of interpretable model results from a mix of structured and unstructured input information. Second, the design, and implementation of automated clinical decision processes for drawing disease trajectories and patient profiles. Ultimately, the clinical impacts depend on the data effectively subjected to steps such as harmonisation, integration, validation, etc. The aim of this work is to discuss the transformative value of IS applied to multimodal data acquired through various interrelated cancer domains (high-throughput genomics, experimental biology, medical image processing, radiomics, patient electronic records, etc.).","Enrico Capobianco,Enrico Capobianco",British Journal of Cancer,2022.0

Radiomic features were extracted from tumors delineated on CT, PET, and wavelet fused PET/CT images obtained from 136 histologically proven NSCLC patients. Univariate and multivariate predictive models were developed using radiomic features before and after ComBat harmonization to predict EGFR and KRAS mutation statuses. Multivariate models were built using minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection and random forest classifier. We utilized 70/30% splitting patient datasets for training/testing, respectively, and repeated the procedure 10 times. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to assess model performance. The performance of the models (univariate and multivariate), before and after ComBat harmonization was compared using statistical analyses. While the performance of most features in univariate modeling was significantly improved for EGFR prediction, most features did not show any significant difference in performance after harmonization in KRAS prediction. Average AUCs of all multivariate predictive models for both EGFR and KRAS were significantly improved (q-value < 0.05) following ComBat harmonization. The ranges of AUCs increased following harmonization from 0.87-0.90 to 0.92–0.94 for EGFR, and from 0.85-0.90 to 0.91–0.94 for KRAS. The highest performance was achieved by harmonized F_R0.66_W0.75 model with AUC of 0.94, and 0.93 for EGFR and KRAS, respectively. Our results demonstrated that regarding univariate modelling, while ComBat harmonization had generally a better impact on features for EGFR compared to KRAS status prediction, its effect is feature-dependent. Hence, no systematic effect was observed. Regarding the multivariate models, ComBat harmonization significantly improved the performance of all radiomics models toward more successful prediction of EGFR and KRAS mutation statuses in lung cancer patients. Thus, by eliminating the batch effect in multi-centric radiomic feature sets, harmonization is a promising tool for developing robust and reproducible radiomics using vast and variant datasets. • The main hypothesis driving this work is that harmonized features can capture the biological status more accurately owing to the elimination of bias-inducing issues. • The aim of the present study is to examine the impact of ComBat harmonization on radiomics features extracted from CT, PET, and fused PET/CT images in EGFR and KRAS mutation status prediction in NSCLC patients. • This study demonstrated that radiomics feature harmonization significantly impacts PET, CT, and fused PET/CT-based analysis toward more successful prediction of EGFR and KRAS mutation statuses in lung cancer patients.","Isaac Shiri,Isaac Shiri,Mehdi Amini,Mehdi Amini,Mostafa Nazari,Mostafa Nazari,Ghasem Hajianfar,Ghasem Hajianfar,Atlas Haddadi Avval,Atlas Haddadi Avval,Hamid Abdollahi,Hamid Abdollahi,Mehrdad Oveisi,Mehrdad Oveisi,Hossein Arabi,Hossein Arabi,Arman Rahmim,Arman Rahmim,Xinchi Hou,Habib Zaidi,Habib Zaidi",Computers in Biology and Medicine,2022.0

Therefore, we used a dataset of breast US images (252 malignant and 253 benign cases) to realize and compare different strategies for CAD support in lesion detection and classification. Eight different datasets (including pre-processed and spatially augmented images) were prepared, and machine learning algorithms (i.e., Viola–Jones; YOLOv3) were trained for lesion detection. The radiomics signature (RS) was derived from detection boxes and compared with RS derived from manually obtained segments. Finally, the classification model was established and evaluated concerning accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. After training on a dataset including logarithmic derivatives of US images, we found that YOLOv3 obtains better results in breast lesion detection (IoU: 0.544 ± 0.081; LE: 0.171 ± 0.009) than the Viola–Jones framework (IoU: 0.399 ± 0.054; LE: 0.096 ± 0.016). Interestingly, our findings show that the classification model trained with RS derived from detection boxes and the model based on the RS derived from a gold standard manual segmentation are comparable (p-value = 0.071). Thus, deriving radiomics signatures from the detection box is a promising technique for building a breast lesion classification model, and may reduce the need for the lesion segmentation step in the future design of CAD systems.","Zuzanna Magnuska,Zuzanna Magnuska,Benjamin Theek,B.

The radiomics features of each patient were extracted from preoperative sagittal T2-weighted images. Significance testing, Pearson correlation analysis, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator were used to select radiomic features associated with multimodality therapy administration. A clinical-radiomics model incorporating radiomics signature, age, 2018 Federation International of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, menopausal status, and preoperative biopsy histological type was developed to identify multimodality therapy candidates. A clinical model and a clinical-conventional radiological model were also constructed. A nomogram and decision curve analysis were developed to facilitate clinical application.ResultsThe clinical-radiomics model showed good predictive performance, with an area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity in the testing set of 0.885 (95% confidence interval: 0.781–0.989), 78.9%, and 81.8%, respectively. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the clinical model and clinical-conventional radiological model were 0.751 (0.603–0.900), 63.2%, and 63.6%, 0.801 (0.661–0.942), 73.7%, and 68.2%, respectively. A decision curve analysis demonstrated that when the threshold probability was > 20%, the clinical-radiomics model or nomogram may be more advantageous than the treat all or treat-none strategy.ConclusionsThe clinical-radiomics model and nomogram can potentially identify multimodality therapy candidates in patients with early-stage cervical cancer.Key Points • Pretreatment identification of multimodality therapy candidates among patients with early-stage cervical cancer helped to select the optimal primary treatment and reduce severe complication risk and costs. • The clinical-radiomics model achieved a better prediction performance compared with the clinical model and the clinical-conventional radiological model. • An easy-to-use nomogram exhibited good performance for individual preoperative prediction.","Ying Li,Yuan Li,Jing Ren,Jing Ren,Junjun Yang,Jun-Jun Yang,Ying Cao,Ying Cao,Xia Chen,Xin Chen,Xi Chen,Elaine Lee,Elaine Y.

The purpose of this study was to measure the classification capability of features extracted using various PET/MR fusion methods in a dataset of soft-tissue sarcoma (STS). Methods The retrospective dataset included 51 patients with histologically proven STS. All patients had pre-treatment PET and MR images. The image-level fusion was conducted using discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). During the DWT process, the MR weight was set as 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, …, 0.9. And the corresponding PET weight was set as 1- (MR weight). The fused PET/MR images was generated using the inverse DWT. The matrix-level fusion was conducted by fusing the feature calculation matrix during the feature extracting process. The feature-level fusion was conducted by concatenating and averaging the features. We measured the predictive performance of features using univariate analysis and multivariable analysis. The univariate analysis included the Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The multivariable analysis was used to develop the signatures by jointing the maximum relevance minimum redundancy method and multivariable logistic regression. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) value was calculated to evaluate the classification performance. Results By using the univariate analysis, the features extracted using image-level fusion method showed the optimal classification performance. For the multivariable analysis, the signatures developed using the image-level fusion-based features showed the best performance. For the T1/PET image-level fusion, the signature developed using the MR weight of 0.1 showed the optimal performance (0.9524(95% confidence interval (CI), 0.8413–0.9999)). For the T2/PET image-level fusion, the signature developed using the MR weight of 0.3 showed the optimal performance (0.9048(95%CI, 0.7356–0.9999)). Conclusions For the fusion of PET/MR images in patients with STS, the signatures developed using the image-level fusion-based features showed the optimal classification performance than the signatures developed using the feature-level fusion and matrix-level fusion-based features, as well as the single modality features.

In this study, we used radiomics in predicting postoperative recovery in CSM. We aimed to develop and validate radiomic feature-based extra trees models.There were 151 patients with CSM who underwent preoperative T2-/ T2*-weighted imaging (WI) and surgery. They were divided into good/poor outcome groups based on the recovery rate. Datasets from multiple scanners were randomised into training and internal validation sets, while the dataset from an independent scanner was used for external validation. Radiomic features were extracted from the transverse spinal cord at the maximum compressed level. Threshold selection algorithm, collinearity removal, and tree-based feature selection were applied sequentially in the training set to obtain the optimal radiomic features. The classification of intramedullary increased signal on T2/T2*WI and compression ratio of the spinal cord on T2*WI were selected as the conventional MRI features. Clinical features were age, preoperative mJOA, and symptom duration. Four models were constructed: radiological, radiomic, clinical-radiological, and clinical-radiomic. An AUC significantly > 0.5 was considered meaningful predictive performance based on the DeLong test. The mean decrease in impurity was used to measure feature importance. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.On internal and external validations, AUCs of the radiomic and clinical-radiomic models, and radiological and clinical-radiological models ranged from 0.71 to 0.81 (significantly > 0.5) and 0.40 to 0.55, respectively. Wavelet-LL first-order variance was the most important feature in the radiomic model.Radiomic features, especially wavelet-LL first-order variance, contribute to meaningful predictive models for CSM prognosis.• Conventional MRI features may not be ideal in predicting prognosis. • Radiomics provides greater predictive efficiency in the recovery from cervical spondylotic myelopathy.","Mengze Zhang,Meng-Ze Zhang,Han-Qiang Ou-Yang,Hanqiang Ouyang,Jianfang Liu,Jian-Fang Liu,Dan Jin,Dan Jin,Chun-Jie Wang,Chunjie Wang,Ming Ni,Ming Ni,Xiaoguang Liu,Xiao-Guang Liu,Ning Lang,Ning Lang,Liang Jiang,Liang Jiang,Hui-Shu Yuan,Yuan Huishu",European Radiology,2022.0

Clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records system. The imaging and radiomics features of each nodule were extracted from CT images. Results A rad-score was generated from the training cohort using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. A clinical and radiographic model was constructed using the clinical and imaging features selected by univariate and multivariate regression. A nomogram composed of clinical-radiographic factors and a rad-score were developed to validate the discriminative ability. The rad-scores differed significantly between the SPLC and PM groups. Sixteen radiomics features and four clinical-radiographic features were selected to build the final model to differentiate between SPLCs and PMs. The comprehensive clinical radiographic–radiomics model demonstrated good discriminative capacity with an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9421 and 0.9041 in the respective training and validation cohorts. The decision curve analysis demonstrated that the comprehensive model showed a higher clinical value than the model without the rad-score.

It occurs frequently in Southeast Asia, North Africa, and especially in southern China. Radiotherapy is the main treatment, and currently, imaging examinations used for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of NPC include computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET)-CT, and PET-MRI. These methods play an important role in target delineation, radiotherapy planning design, dose evaluation, and outcome prediction. However, the anatomical and metabolic information obtained at the macro level of images may not meet the increasing accuracy required for radiotherapy. As a technology used for mining deep image information, radiomics can provide further information for the diagnosis and treatment of NPC and promote individualized precision radiotherapy in the future. This paper reviews the application of radiomics in the diagnosis and treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.","Yong Zhang,Yumei Zhang,Guan-zhong Gong,Guanzhong Gong,Qing-tao Qiu,Qingtao Qiu,Yun-wei Han,Yunwei Han,He-ming Lu,Hongsheng Lu,Yutian Yin,Yong Yin",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0
10.3390/diagnostics12020247,,,Reliability as a Precondition for Trust—Segmentation Reliability Analysis of Radiomic Features Improves Survival Prediction,"Machine learning results based on radiomic analysis are often not transferrable. A potential reason for this is the variability of radiomic features due to varying human made segmentations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide comprehensive inter-reader reliability analysis of radiomic features in five clinical image datasets and to assess the association of inter-reader reliability and survival prediction. In this study, we analyzed 4598 tumor segmentations in both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging data. We used a neural network to generate 100 additional segmentation outlines for each tumor and performed a reliability analysis of radiomic features. To prove clinical utility, we predicted patient survival based on all features and on the most reliable features. Survival prediction models for both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging datasets demonstrated less statistical spread and superior survival prediction when based on the most reliable features. Mean concordance indices were Cmean = 0.58 [most reliable] vs. Cmean = 0.56 [all] (p < 0.001, CT) and Cmean = 0.58 vs. Cmean = 0.57 (p = 0.23, MRI). Thus, preceding reliability analyses and selection of the most reliable radiomic features improves the underlying model's ability to predict patient survival across clinical imaging modalities and tumor entities.","Gustav Müller-Franzes,Gustav Müller‐Franzes,Sven Nebelung,Sven Nebelung,Sven Nebelung,Justus Schock,Justus Schock,Christoph Haarburger,Christoph Haarburger,Firas Khader,Firas Khader,Federico Pedersoli,Federico Pedersoli,Maximilian Schulze-Hagen,Maximilian Schulze-Hagen,Christiane Kuhl,Christiane Kühl,Daniel Truhn,Daniel Truhn",,2022.0
10.3390/diagnostics12020256,,,Ultrasound Radiomics Nomogram Integrating Three-Dimensional Features Based on Carotid Plaques to Evaluate Coronary Artery Disease,"This study aimed to explore the feasibility of ultrasound radiomics analysis before invasive coronary angiography (ICA) for evaluating the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) quantified by the SYNTAX score (SS). This study included 105 carotid plaques from 105 patients (64 low-SS patients, 41 intermediate-high-SS patients). The clinical characteristics and three-dimensional ultrasound (3D-US) features before ICA were assessed. Ultrasound images of carotid plaques were used for radiomics analysis. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, which generated several nonzero coefficients, was used to select features that could predict intermediate-high SS. Based on those coefficients, the radiomics score (Rad-score) was calculated. The selected clinical characteristics, 3D-US features, and Rad-score were finally integrated into a radiomics nomogram. Among the clinical characteristics and 3D-US features, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and plaque volume were identified as predictors for distinguishing between low SS and intermediate-high SS. During the radiomics process, 8 optimal radiomics features most capable of identifying intermediate-high SS were selected from 851 candidate radiomics features. The differences in Rad-score between the training and the validation set were significant (p = 0.016 and 0.006). The radiomics nomogram integrating HDL, Apo B, plaque volume, and Rad-score showed excellent results in the training set (AUC, 0.741 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.646-0.835)) and validation set (AUC, 0.939 (95% CI: 0.860-1.000)), with good calibration (mean absolute errors of 0.028 and 0.059 in training and validation sets, respectively). Decision curve analysis showed that the radiomics nomogram could identify patients who could obtain the most benefit. We concluded that the radiomics nomogram based on carotid plaque ultrasound has favorable value for the noninvasive prediction of intermediate-high SS. This radiomics nomogram has potential value for the risk stratification of CAD before ICA and provides clinicians with a noninvasive diagnostic tool.","Xiaoting Wang,Xiaoting Wang,Peng Luo,Peng Luo,Huaan Du,Huaan Du,Shiyu Li,Sha Li,Yi Wang,Yi Wang,Xun Guo,Xun Guo,Li Wan,Li Wan,Binyi Zhao,Binyi Zhao,Jianli Ren,Jianli Ren",,2022.0

The purpose of this study was to construct and validate a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT)-based radiomics signature to discriminate between high and low expression status of PD-L1.A total of 179 HNSCC patients who underwent immunohistochemical examination of tumor PD-L1 expression at one of two centers were enrolled in this study and divided into a training set (n=122; 55 high PD-L1 expression and 67 low PD-L1 expression) and an external validation set (n=57; 26 high PD-L1 expression and 31 low PD-L1 expression). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method was used to select the key features for a CECT-image-based radiomics signature. The performance of the radiomics signature was assessed using receiver operating characteristics analysis.Six features were finally selected to construct the radiomics signature. The performance of the radiomics signature in the discrimination between high and low PD-L1 expression status was good in both the training and validation sets, with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.889 and 0.834 for the training and validation sets, respectively.The constructed CECT-based radiomics signature model showed favorable performance for discriminating between high and low PD-L1 expression status in HNSCC patients. It may be useful for screening out those patients with HNSCC who can best benefit from anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy.","Ying-Mei Zheng,Ying-Mei Zheng,Jin-Feng Zhan,Jinfeng Zhan,Ming-Gang Yuan,Ming-Gang Yuan,Feng Hou,Feng Hou,Gang Ji,Gang Jiang,Zeng-Jie Wu,Zhen Wu,Cheng Dong,Cheng Dong",European Journal of Radiology,2021.0

A retrospective, multicentric diagnostic case–control study was performed. This study included 120 patients with unilateral or bilateral Meniere’s disease and 140 controls from four centers in the Netherlands and Belgium. Multiple radiomic features were extracted from conventional MRI scans and used to train a machine learning-based, multi-layer perceptron classification model to distinguishpatients with Meniere’s disease from controls. The primary outcomes were accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the classification model. The classification accuracy of the machine learning model on the test set was 82%, with a sensitivity of 83%, and a specificity of 82%. The positive and negative predictive values were 71%, and 90%, respectively. The multi-layer perceptron classification model yielded a precise, high-diagnostic performance in identifying patients with Meniere’s disease based on radiomic features extracted from conventional T2-weighted MRI scans. In the future, radiomics might serve as a fast and noninvasive decision support system, next to clinical evaluation in the diagnosis of Meniere’s disease.","Marly F. J.

TA is specifically concerned with the study of the variation of pixel intensity values in radiological images. Radiologists aim to capture pixel variation in radiological images to deliver new insights into tumor biology that cannot be derived from visual inspection alone. TA remains an active area of investigation and requires further standardization prior to its clinical acceptance and applicability. This review is for radiologists interested in this rapidly evolving field, who are thinking of performing research or want to better interpret results in this arena.

Material and Methods This retrospective study included 279 pathology-confirmed SOTs US images from 265 patients from March 2013 to December 2016. Two- and three-class classification task based on US images were proposed to classify benign, borderline, and malignant SOTs using a DCNN. The 2-class classification task was divided into two subtasks: benign vs. borderline &amp;amp; malignant (task A), borderline vs. malignant (task B). Five DCNN architectures, namely VGG16, GoogLeNet, ResNet34, MobileNet, and DenseNet, were trained and model performance before and after transfer learning was tested. Model performance was analyzed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results The best overall performance was for the ResNet34 model, which also achieved the better performance after transfer learning. When classifying benign and non-benign tumors, the AUC was 0.96, the sensitivity was 0.91, and the specificity was 0.91. When predicting malignancy and borderline tumors, the AUC was 0.91, the sensitivity was 0.98, and the specificity was 0.74. The model had an overall accuracy of 0.75 for in directly classifying the three categories of benign, malignant and borderline SOTs, and a sensitivity of 0.89 for malignant, which was better than the overall diagnostic accuracy of 0.67 and sensitivity of 0.75 for malignant of the senior ultrasonographer.

Accurate screening is helpful to early detection and improve the treatment success rate and patient survival rate. This study is based on low-cost ultrasound, using ultrasound multifeature maps based on the original radiofrequency (RF) signals and radiomics analysis method to evaluate the benign and malignant of breast tumors. The three ultrasound multifeature maps of breast tumor are composed of direct energy attenuation coefficient (AC), standard deviation of image intensity (SD) and Rician distribution parameters (RD). From the above multifeature maps, high-throughput radiomics features were extracted, then sparse representation method was used for feature selection, and then support vector machine was used to predict the benign and malignant of breast tumors. Eight groups of comparative experiments were established by using ultrasound gray-scale image, single ultrasound feature map and two ultrasound feature maps. The results from 164 patients with breast tumor showed that the AUC, accuracy and sensitivity of the radiomics classification model with feature maps of AC, SD and RD can reach 93.61%, 93.94% and 100%, respectively. The use of RF based ultrasound multifeature maps combined with radiomics could effectively predict the benign and malignant of breast tumors in this study.","Qingmin Wang,Qingmin Wang,Xiaohong Jia,Xiaohong Jia,Tianlei Xiao,Tianlei Xiao,Yao Zhao,Zhao Yao,Jianqiao Zhou,Jianqiao Zhou,Jinhua Yu,Jinhua Yu",,2021.0

Identification of these patients might enable individualized treatment. Purpose To investigate whether an existing machine-learning model with radiomics features based on pre-ablation computed tomography (CT) images of patients with colorectal cancer can predict development of new CRLM. Material and Methods In total, 94 patients with CRLM who were treated with thermal ablation were analyzed. Radiomics features were extracted from the healthy liver parenchyma of CT images in the portal venous phase, before thermal ablation. First, a previously developed radiomics model (Original model) was applied to the entire cohort to predict new CRLM after 6 and 24 months of follow-up. Next, new machine-learning models were developed (Radiomics, Clinical, and Combined), based on radiomics features, clinical features, or a combination of both. Results The external validation of the Original model reached an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.56–0.58) and 0.52 (95% CI=0.51–0.53) for 6 and 24 months of follow-up. The new predictive radiomics models yielded a higher performance at 6 months compared to 24 months. For the prediction of CRLM at 6 months, the Combined model had slightly better performance (AUC=0.60; 95% CI=0.59–0.61) compared to the Radiomics and Clinical models (AUC=0.55–0.57), while all three models had a low performance for the prediction at 24 months (AUC=0.52–0.53).

Among thermographic techniques, deep neural networks show an unequivocal potential to detect heterogeneous thermal patterns related to vasodilation in breast cancer cases. Such methods are used to extract high-dimensional thermal features, known as deep thermomics. In this study, we applied convex non-negative matrix factorization (convex NMF) to extract three predominant bases of thermal sequences. Then, the data were fed into a sparse autoencoder model, known as SPAER, to extract low-dimensional deep thermomics, which were then used to assist the clinical breast exam (CBE) in breast cancer screening. The application of convex NMF-SPAER, combining clinical and demographic covariates, yielded a result of 79.3% (73.5%, 86.9%); the highest result belonged to NMF-SPAER at 84.9% (79.3%, 88.7%). The proposed approach preserved thermal heterogeneity and led to early detection of breast cancer.

Objectives: The present study aimed to develop a plasma Family with sequence similarity 19, member A5 (FAM19A5) and MRI-based radiomics nomogram to predict PD and PDD. Methods: The study involved 176 PD patients and 181 healthy controls (HC). Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure FAM19A5 concentration in the plasma samples collected from all participants. For enrolled subjects, MRI data were collected from 164 individuals (82 in the PD group and 82 in the HC group). The bilateral amygdala, head of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and substantia nigra, and red nucleus were manually labeled on the MR images. Radiomics features of the labeled regions were extracted. Further, machine learning methods were applied to shrink the feature size and build a predictive radiomics signature. The resulting radiomics signature was combined with plasma FAM19A5 concentration and other risk factors to establish logistic regression models for the prediction of PD and PDD. Results: The plasma FAM19A5 levels (2.456 ± 0.517) were recorded to be significantly higher in the PD group as compared to the HC group (2.23 ± 0.457) ( P &amp;lt; 0.001). Importantly, the plasma FAM19A5 levels were also significantly higher in the PDD subgroup (2.577 ± 0.408) as compared to the non-depressive subgroup (2.406 ± 0.549) ( P = 0.045 &amp;lt; 0.05). The model based on the combination of plasma FAM19A5 and radiomics signature showed excellent predictive validity for PD and PDD, with AUCs of 0.913 (95% CI: 0.861–0.955) and 0.937 (95% CI: 0.845–0.970), respectively. Conclusion: Altogether, the present study reported the development of nomograms incorporating radiomics signature, plasma FAM19A5, and clinical risk factors, which might serve as potential tools for early prediction of PD and PDD in clinical settings.","Xinru Li,Xuening Li,Da-peng Hao,Dapeng Hao,Mei-jie Qu,Meijie Qu,Meng Zhang,Meng Zhang,An-bang Ma,An-bang Ma,Xu-dong Pan,Xudong Pan,Aijun Ma,Ai-jun Ma",Frontiers in Neuroscience,2021.0

However, not all patients respond well to NAC. Therefore, we aimed to develop and evaluate a modified radiomics model for the NAC response prognosis in NPC patients.A total of 165 patients with biopsy-proven locally advanced NPC were retrospectively selected from the database of our hospital. 85 out of them were for training and cross-validation, while the other 80 patients were for independent testing. All patients were treated with NAC and underwent MRI inspection, including T1-weighted (T1), T2-weighted (T2), and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (T1-cs) sequences before and after two cycles of NAC. We classified the patients into the response or non-response groups by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). Radiomics features were extracted from the primary and lymph node gross tumor volume in each sequence. To further improve the predictive performance, the permutation of multiple combinations of extraction parameters has first ever been investigated in the NAC prognosis for NPC patients. The model was constructed by logistic regression and cross-validated by bootstrapping with a resampling number of 1000. Independent testing was also implemented. In addition, we also applied an imbalance-adjusted bootstrap strategy to decrease the bias of small samples.For the cross-validation cohort, the resultant AUC, sensitivity, and specificity in terms of 95% confidence interval were 0.948 ± 0.004, 0.849 ± 0.005, and 0.840 ± 0.010. For the independent testing cohort, the model reached an AUC of 0.925, a sensitivity of 0.821, and a specificity of 0.792. There was a significant difference in the estimated radiomics score between the response and non-response groups (P < 0.005).An MRI-based radiomics model was developed and demonstrated promising capability for the individual prediction of NAC response in NPC patients. In particular, we have optimized the multiple combinations of texture extraction parameters with the permutation test and observed an encouraging improvement of the prediction performance compared to the previously published studies. The proposed model might provide chances for individualized treatment in NPC patients while retrenching the cost of clinical resources.","Ling He,Yiling Wang,Yiling Wang,Chen Li,Churong Li,Gang Yin,Yin Guo,Gang Yin,Jie Wang,Jie Wang,Jiahui Li,Jie Li,Pei Wang,Pei Wang,Pei Wang,Jie Bian,Jie Bian",Clinical and Translational Radiation Oncology,2021.0
10.3389/fonc.2021.774413,,,Fractal-Based Radiomic Approach to Tailor the Chemotherapy Treatment in Rectal Cancer: A Generating Hypothesis Study,"Introduction The aim of this study was to create a radiomic model able to calculate the probability of 5-year disease-free survival (5yDFS) when oxaliplatin (OXA) is or not administered in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) and treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), allowing physicians to choose the best chemotherapy (CT) regimen. Methods LARC patients with cT3–4 cN0 or cT1–4 cN1–2 were treated according to an nCRT protocol that included concomitant CT schedules with or without OXA and radiotherapy dose of 55 Gy in 25 fractions. Radiomic analysis was performed on the T2-weighted (T2-w) MR images acquired during the initial tumor staging. Statistical analysis was performed separately for the cohort of patients treated with and without OXA. The ability of every single radiomic feature in predicting 5yDFS as a univariate analysis was assessed using the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney (WMW) test or t-test. Two logistic models (one for each cohort) were calculated, and their performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Results A total of 176 image features belonging to four families (morphological, statistical, textural, and fractal) were calculated for each patient. At the univariate analysis, the only feature showing significance in predicting 5yDFS was the maximum fractal dimension of the subpopulation identified considering 30% and 50% as threshold levels (maxFD 30–50 ). Once the models were developed using this feature, an AUC of 0.67 (0.57–0.77) and 0.75 (0.56–0.95) was obtained for patients treated with and without OXA, respectively. A maxFD 30–50 &amp;gt;1.6 was correlated to a higher 5yDFS probability in patients treated with OXA. Conclusion This study suggests that radiomic analysis of MR T2-w images can be used to define the optimal concomitant CT regimen for stage III LARC cancer patients. In particular, by providing an indication of the gross tumor volume (GTV) spatial heterogeneity at initial staging, maxFD 30–50 seems to be able to predict the probability of 5yDFS. New studies including a larger cohort of patients and external validation sets are recommended to verify the results of this hypothesis-generating study.","Carmela Di Dio,Carmela Di Dio,G.

The best method obtained an average DSC of 0.7591, showing a large improvement over our proposed baseline method and the inter-observer agreement, associated with DSCs of 0.6610 and 0.61, respectively. The automatic methods proved to successfully leverage the wealth of metabolic and structural properties of combined PET and CT modalities, significantly outperforming human inter-observer agreement level, semi-automatic thresholding based on PET images as well as other single modality-based methods. This promising performance is one step forward towards large-scale radiomics studies in H&N cancer, obviating the need for error-prone and time-consuming manual delineation of GTVs.","Valentin Oreiller,Valentin Oreiller,Vincent Andrearczyk,Vincent Andrearczyk,Mario Jreige,Mario Jreige,Sarah Boughdad,Sarah Boughdad,Hesham Elhalawani,Hesham Elhalawani,Joël Castelli,J.

10.1007/s00259-021-05626-3,34850248.0,,Machine learning in the differentiation of follicular lymphoma from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with radiomic [18F]FDG PET/CT features,"Background  One of the challenges in the management of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) is the identification of individuals with histological transformation, most commonly into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). [18F]FDG-PET/CT is used for staging of patients with lymphoma, but visual interpretation cannot reliably discern FL from DLBCL. This study evaluated whether radiomic features extracted from clinical baseline [18F]FDG PET/CT and analyzed by machine learning algorithms may help discriminate FL from DLBCL.  Materials and methods  Patients were selected based on confirmed histopathological diagnosis of primary FL (n=44) or DLBCL (n=76) and available [18F]FDG PET/CT with EARL reconstruction parameters within 6 months of diagnosis. Radiomic features were extracted from the volume of interest on co-registered [18F]FDG PET and CT images. Analysis of selected radiomic features was performed with machine learning classifiers based on logistic regression and tree-based ensemble classifiers (AdaBoosting, Gradient Boosting, and XG Boosting). The performance of radiomic features was compared with a SUVmax-based logistic regression model.  Results  From the segmented lesions, 121 FL and 227 DLBCL lesions were included for radiomic feature extraction. In total, 79 radiomic features were extracted from the SUVmap, 51 from CT, and 6 shape features. Machine learning classifier Gradient Boosting achieved the best discrimination performance using 136 radiomic features (AUC of 0.86 and accuracy of 80%). SUVmax-based logistic regression model achieved an AUC of 0.79 and an accuracy of 70%. Gradient Boosting classifier had a significantly greater AUC and accuracy compared to the SUVmax-based logistic regression (p≤0.01).  Conclusion  Machine learning analysis of radiomic features may be of diagnostic value for discriminating FL from DLBCL tumor lesions, beyond that of the SUVmax alone.","Filipe Montes de Jesus,F M Montes de Jesus,Yunchao Yin,Y Yin,E Mantzorou-Kyriaki,E Mantzorou-Kyriaki,X U Kahle,X U Kahle,Robbert J. de Haas,R J de Haas,Derya Yakar,Derya Yakar,Andor W J M Glaudemans,Andor W.

10.3390/diagnostics11122199,,,"Male Breast Cancer Review. A Rare Case of Pure DCIS: Imaging Protocol, Radiomics and Management","Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of male breast is a rare lesion, often associated with invasive carcinoma. When the in situ component is present in pure form, histological grade is usually low or intermediate. Imaging is difficult as gynaecomastia is often present and can mask underlying findings. We report a rare case of pure high-grade DCIS in a young male patient, with associated intraductal papilloma and atypical ductal hyperplasia. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) showed an area of architectural distortion at the union of outer quadrants of the left breast without gynaecomastia. Triple assessment suggested performing a nipple-sparing mastectomy, which revealed the presence of a focal area of high-grade DCIS of 2 mm. DCIS, even of high grade, is difficult to detect with mammography and even more rare, especially when associated with other proliferative lesions. DBT with 2D synthetic reconstruction is useful as the imaging step of a triple assessment and it should be performed in both symptomatic and asymptomatic high-risk men to differentiate between malignant and benign lesions. We propose a diagnostic model to early detect breast cancer in men, optimizing resources according to efficiency, effectiveness and economy, and look forward to radiomics as a powerful tool to help radiologists.","Daniele Ugo Tari,Daniele Ugo Tari,Luigi Morelli,Antonella Guida,Luigi Morelli,Antonella Guida,Fábio Pinto,Fabio Pinto",,2021.0

The two main limitations of radiomics prognostic models include information limitation owing to single imaging modalities and the selection of optimum machine learning and feature selection methods for the considered modality and clinical outcome. In this work, we applied several feature selection and machine learning methods to single-modality positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) and multimodality PET/CT fusion to identify the best combinations for different radiomics modalities towards overall survival prediction in non-small cell lung cancer patients.A PET/CT dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive, including subjects from two independent institutions (87 and 95 patients), was used in this study. Each cohort was used once as training and once as a test, followed by averaging of the results. ComBat harmonisation was used to address the centre effect. In our proposed radiomics framework, apart from single-modality PET and CT models, multimodality radiomics models were developed using multilevel (feature and image levels) fusion. Two different methods were considered for the feature-level strategy, including concatenating PET and CT features into a single feature set and alternatively averaging them. For image-level fusion, we used three different fusion methods, namely wavelet fusion, guided filtering-based fusion and latent low-rank representation fusion. In the proposed prognostic modelling framework, combinations of four feature selection and seven machine learning methods were applied to all radiomics modalities (two single and five multimodalities), machine learning hyper-parameters were optimised and finally the models were evaluated in the test cohort with 1000 repetitions via bootstrapping. Feature selection and machine learning methods were selected as popular techniques in the literature, supported by open source software in the public domain and their ability to cope with continuous time-to-event survival data. Multifactor ANOVA was used to carry out variability analysis and the proportion of total variance explained by radiomics modality, feature selection and machine learning methods was calculated by a bias-corrected effect size estimate known as ω2.Optimum feature selection and machine learning methods differed owing to the applied radiomics modality. However, minimum depth (MD) as feature selection and Lasso and Elastic-Net regularized generalized linear model (glmnet) as machine learning method had the highest average results. Results from the ANOVA test indicated that the variability that each factor (radiomics modality, feature selection and machine learning methods) introduces to the performance of models is case specific, i.e. variances differ regarding different radiomics modalities and fusion strategies. Overall, the greatest proportion of variance was explained by machine learning, except for models in feature-level fusion strategy.The identification of optimal feature selection and machine learning methods is a crucial step in developing sound and accurate radiomics risk models. Furthermore, optimum methods are case specific, differing due to the radiomics modality and fusion strategy used.","Mehdi Amini,Mehdi Amini,Ghasem Hajianfar,Ghasem Hajianfar,Atlas Hadadi Avval,Atlas Haddadi Avval,Mostafa Nazari,Mostafa Nazari,Mohammad Reza Deevband,Mohammad Reza Deevband,Mehrdad Oveisi,Mehrdad Oveisi,Isaac Shiri,Isaac Shiri,Habib Zaidi,Habib Zaidi",Clinical Oncology,2021.0

Materials and Methods A total of 243 patients were analyzed. We extracted 10,400 radiomics features from the primary nasopharyngeal tumors and largest metastatic lymph nodes on the axial contrast-enhanced T1 weighted and T2 weighted in pre- and mid-treatment MRI, respectively. We used the SMOTE algorithm, center and scale and box-cox, Pearson correlation coefficient, and LASSO regression to construct the pre- and mid-treatment MRI-radiomics prediction model, respectively, and the risk scores named P score and M score were calculated. Finally, univariate and multivariate analyses were used for P score, M score, and clinical data to build the combined model and grouped the patients into two risk levels, namely, high and low. Result A combined model of pre- and mid-treatment MRI-radiomics successfully categorized patients into high- and low-risk groups. The log-rank test showed that the high- and low-risk groups had good prognostic performance in PFS (P&amp;lt;0.0001, HR: 19.71, 95% CI: 12.77–30.41), which was better than TNM stage (P=0.004, HR:1.913, 95% CI:1.250–2.926), and also had an excellent predictive effect in LRFS, DMFS, and OS.

10.2478/pjmpe-2021-0030,,,"Pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosis, differentiation and disease management: A review of radiomics applications","Abstract Pulmonary tuberculosis is a worldwide epidemic that can only be fought effectively with early and accurate diagnosis and proper disease management. The means of diagnosis and disease management should be easily accessible, cost effective and be readily available in the high tuberculosis burdened countries where it is most needed. Fortunately, the fast development of computer science in recent years has ensured that medical images can accurately be quantified. Radiomics is one such tool that can be used to quantify medical images. This review article focuses on the literature currently available on the application of radiomics explicitly for the purpose of diagnosis, differentiation from other pulmonary diseases and disease management of pulmonary tuberculosis. Despite using a formal search strategy, only five articles could be found on the application of radiomics to pulmonary tuberculosis. In all five articles reviewed, radiomic feature extraction was successfully used to quantify digital medical images for the purpose of comparing, or differentiating, pulmonary tuberculosis from other pulmonary diseases. This demonstrates that the use of radiomics for the purpose of tuberculosis disease management and diagnosis remains a valuable data mining opportunity not yet realised.","Tamarisk Du Plessis,Tamarisk Du Plessis,William Rae,William Ian Duncombe Rae,Mike Michael Sathekge,Mike Sathekge",Polish Journal of Medical Physics and Engineering,2021.0

Materials and Methods: Forty-seven patients with MS (mean age = 40.00 ± 13.72 years) and 36 patients with NMOSD (mean age = 42.14 ± 12.34 years) who underwent enhanced gradient-echo T 2 *-weighted angiography (ESWAN) sequence in 3.0-T MRI were included between April 2017 and October 2019. QSM images were reconstructed from ESWAN, and QSM-derived radiomic features were obtained from seven regions of interest (ROIs), including bilateral putamen, globus pallidus, head of the caudate nucleus, thalamus, substantia nigra, red nucleus, and dentate nucleus. A machine learning model (logistic regression) was applied to classify MS and NMOSD, which combined radiomic signatures and demographic information to assess the classification accuracy using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Results: The radiomics-only models showed better discrimination performance in almost all deep gray matter (DGM) regions than the demographic information-only model, with the highest AUC in DN of 0.902 (95% CI: 0.840–0.955). Moreover, the hybrid model combining radiomic signatures and demographic information showed the highest discrimination performance which achieved the AUC of 0.927 (95% CI: 0.871–0.984) with fivefold cross-validation. Conclusion: The hybrid model based on QSM and powered with machine learning has the potential to discriminate MS from NMOSD.","Yan Zhang,Zichun Yan,Huan Liu,Huan Liu,Xuan Chen,Xiaoya Chen,Qiao Zheng,Qiao Zheng,Chun Zeng,Chun Zeng,Yineng Zheng,Yineng Zheng,Shuang Ding,Shuang Ding,Yuling Peng,Yuling Peng,Yongmei Li,Yongmei Li",,2021.0

Plenty of radiomics models for MVI prediction have been proposed. This study aimed to elucidate the role of radiomics models in the prediction of MVI and to evaluate their methodological quality. The methodological quality was assessed by the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS), and the risk of bias was evaluated by the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2). Twenty-two studies using CT, MRI, or PET/CT for MVI prediction were included. All were retrospective studies, and only two had an external validation cohort. The AUC values of the prediction models ranged from 0.69 to 0.94 in the test cohort. Substantial methodological heterogeneity existed, and the methodological quality was low, with an average RQS score of 10 (28% of the total). Most studies demonstrated a low or unclear risk of bias in the domains of QUADAS-2. In conclusion, a radiomics model could be an accurate and effective tool for MVI prediction in HCC patients, although the methodological quality has so far been insufficient. Future prospective studies with an external validation cohort in accordance with a standardized radiomics workflow are expected to supply a reliable model that translates into clinical utilization.","Qiang Wang,Qiang Wang,Changfeng Li,Changfeng Li,Jiaxing Zhang,Jiaxing Zhang,Xiaojun Hu,Xiaojun Hu,Yingfang Fan,Kui Ma,Yingfang Fan,Ernesto Sparrelid,Kuansheng Ma,Torkel Brismar,Ernesto Sparrelid,Torkel B.

However, the ability of radiomics-related models to predict revised hematoma expansion (RHE) with the inclusion of intraventricular hemorrhage expansion remains unclear. To develop and validate a noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT)-based clinical- semantic-radiomics nomogram to identify supratentorial spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) patients with RHE on admission.In this double-center retrospective study, data from 376 patients with sICH (training set: n=299; test set: n=77; external validation cohort: n=91) were reviewed. A radiomics model, a clinical-semantic model, and a combined model were then constructed based on the logistic regression machine learning approach. Radiomics features were extracted and selected by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) with 5-fold cross validation. Furthermore, the classical BRAIN scoring system was also constructed to predict RHE. Discriminative performance of the models was evaluated on the training and test set with area under the curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA).The addition of radiomics to clinical-semantic factors significantly improved the prediction performance of RHE compared with the clinical-semantic model alone in the training (AUC, 0.94 vs. 0.81, P<0.05) and test (AUC, 0.84 vs. 0.71, P<0.05) sets, with similar results in the validation set (AUC, 0.83 vs. 0.69, P<0.05). Moreover, the discrimination efficacy of the BRAIN score was significantly lower than the other 3 models (AUC of 0.71 in the training set, P<0.05).The clinical-semantic-radiomics combined model had the greatest potential for discriminating RHE, and significantly outperformed the classical BRAIN scoring system.","Xiaona Xia,Xiaona Xia,Qingguo Ren,Qingguo Ren,Jiufa Cui,Jiufa Cui,Hao Dong,Hao Dong,Zhaodi Huang,Zhaodi Huang,Qingjun Jiang,Qing-jun Jiang,Shuai Guan,Shuai Guan,Chencui Huang,Chencui Huang,Jihan Yin,Jihan Yin,Jingxu Xu,Jingxu Xu,Kongming Liang,Kongming Liang,Hao Wang,Hao Wang,Kai Han,Kai Han,Xiangshui Meng,Xiangshui Meng",Annals of Translational Medicine,2021.0

Radiomics, an emerging field involving the extraction of advanced features from radiographic images, has the potential to revolutionize oncologic treatment and contribute to the advance of personalized therapy by helping predict tumor behavior and response to therapy. This review analyzes and summarizes studies that use radiomics with machine learning in patients who have received neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy to predict prognosis, recurrence, survival, and therapeutic response for various cancer types. While studies in both neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings demonstrate above average performance on ability to predict progression-free and overall survival, there remain many challenges and limitations to widespread implementation of this technology.

The samples were randomly divided into the training set (n=123) and validation verification set (n= 54) according to the ratio of 7:3，the radiomic features were derived from DCE-MRI phase 2 images, 1316 original eigenvectors are normalized by maximum and minimum normalization, the optimal feature filter and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were used to obtain the optimal features. Six Five machine learning models of Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, Nomogram and Decision Tree were constructed based on the selected features. Radiomics signature and independent risk factors were incorporated to build a combined model. The receiver Receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve were was used to evaluate the performance of the above models, and the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. Results: There is no significant difference between all clinical and histopathological variables in breast cancer patients with and without SLN metastasis (P >0.05), except tumor size and BI-RADS classification (P< 0.01). Thirteen features were obtained as optimal features for machine learning models construction. In the validation set, the AUC (0.86) of SVM was the highest among the six five machine learning models. Meanwhile, the combined model showed better performance in sentinel lymph node metastasis (SLNM) prediction and achieved a higher AUC (0.88) in the validation set. Conclusions: We revealed the clinical value of machine learning models established based on DCE-MRI radiomic features, providing a highly accurate, non-invasive, and convenient method to for preoperative prediction of SLNM in breast cancer patients.","Yadi Zhu,Ling Yang,Yadi Zhu,Ling Yang,Hailin Shen,Hailin Shen",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0

High microvessel density by morphological characterization predicts metastasis and poor survival in women with invasive breast cancers. However, morphologic characterization is subject to variability and only can evaluate a limited portion of an invasive breast cancer. Consequently, breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is currently being evaluated to assess vascularity. Recently, through the new field of radiomics, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI is being used to evaluate vascular density, vascular morphology, and detection of aggressive breast cancer biology. While DCE-MRI is a highly sensitive tool, there are specific features that limit computational evaluation of blood vessels. These include (1) DCE-MRI evaluates gadolinium contrast and does not directly evaluate biology, (2) the resolution of DCE-MRI is insufficient for imaging small blood vessels, and (3) DCE-MRI images are very difficult to co-register. Here we review computational approaches for detection and analysis of blood vessels in DCE-MRI images and present some of the strategies we have developed for co-registry of DCE-MRI images and early detection of vascularization.","David E.

In this study, CT radiomic features are evaluated to differentiate pulmonary hamartomas (PHs) from pulmonary carcinoid tumors (PCTs). A total of 138 patients (78 PCTs and 60 PHs) were evaluated. The Radcloud platform (Huiying Medical Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) was used for managing the data, clinical data, and subsequent radiomics analysis. Two hand-crafted radiomics models are prepared in this study: the first model includes the data regarding all of the patients to differentiate between the groups; the second model includes 78 PCTs and 38 PHs without signs of fat tissue. The separation of the training and validation datasets was performed randomly using an (8:2) ratio and 620 random seeds. The results revealed that the MLP method (RF) was best for PH (AUC = 0.999) and PCT (AUC = 0.999) for the first model (AUC = 0.836), and PC (AUC = 0.836) in the test set for the second model. Radiomics tumor features derived from CT images are useful to differentiate the carcinoid tumors from hamartomas with high accuracy. Radiomics features may be used to differentiate PHs from PCTs with high levels of accuracy, even without the presence of fat on the CT.

10.3390/life12020241,,,A Multi-Center Study of CT-Based Neck Nodal Radiomics for Predicting an Adaptive Radiotherapy Trigger of Ill-Fitted Thermoplastic Masks in Patients with Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma,"Significant lymph node shrinkage is common in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) throughout radiotherapy (RT) treatment, causing ill-fitted thermoplastic masks (IfTMs). To deal with this, an ad hoc adaptive radiotherapy (ART) may be required to ensure accurate and safe radiation delivery and to maintain treatment efficacy. Presently, the entire procedure for evaluating an eligible ART candidate is time-consuming, resource-demanding, and highly inefficient. In the artificial intelligence paradigm, the pre-treatment identification of NPC patients at risk for IfTMs has become greatly demanding for achieving efficient ART eligibility screening, while no relevant studies have been reported. Hence, we aimed to investigate the capability of computed tomography (CT)-based neck nodal radiomics for predicting IfTM-triggered ART events in NPC patients via a multi-center setting. Contrast-enhanced CT and the clinical data of 124 and 58 NPC patients from Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) and Queen Mary Hospital (QMH), respectively, were retrospectively analyzed. Radiomic (R), clinical (C), and combined (RC) models were developed using the ridge algorithm in the QEH cohort and evaluated in the QMH cohort using the median area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). Delong’s test was employed for model comparison. Model performance was further assessed on 1000 replicates in both cohorts separately via bootstrapping. The R model yielded the highest “corrected” AUC of 0.784 (BCa 95%CI: 0.673–0.859) and 0.723 (BCa 95%CI: 0.534–0.859) in the QEH and QMH cohort following bootstrapping, respectively. Delong’s test indicated that the R model performed significantly better than the C model in the QMH cohort (p &lt; 0.0001), while demonstrating no significant difference compared to the RC model (p = 0.5773). To conclude, CT-based neck nodal radiomics was capable of predicting IfTM-triggered ART events in NPC patients in this multi-center study, outperforming the traditional clinical model. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for future study into developing an effective screening strategy for ART eligibility in NPC patients in the long run, ultimately alleviating the workload of clinical practitioners, streamlining ART procedural efficiency in clinics, and achieving personalized RT for NPC patients in the future.","Sai-Kit Lam,Saikit Lam,Jiang Zhang,Jiang Zhang,Yuanpeng Zhang,Yuanpeng Zhang,Bing Liu,Bing Li,Rui-Yan Ni,Ruiyan Ni,Ta Zhou,Zhou Ta,Tao Peng,Tao Peng,Andy Lai-Yin Cheung,Ankie Tan Cheung,Tin-Ching Chau,Tin‐Ching Chau,Francis Kar-Ho Lee,Francis Kar-ho Lee,Celia Wai-Yi Yip,Celia Wai-Yi Yip,Kwok-Hung Au,Kwok‐Hung Au,Victor C.

IDH + LrGG patients were further stratified into the ATRX − (n = 38) and ATRX + (n = 38) subtypes. A total of 250 radiomics features were extracted from the region of interest of each tumor, including that from T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2 FLAIR), contrast-enhanced T1 WI, ASL-derived cerebral blood flow (CBF), DWI-derived ADC, and exponential ADC (eADC). A radiomics signature was selected using the Elastic Net regression model, and a radiomics nomogram was finally constructed using the age, gender information, and above features. Results The radiomics nomogram identified LrGG patients for IDH mutation (C-index: training sets = 0.881, validation sets = 0.900) and ATRX loss (C-index: training sets = 0.863, validation sets = 0.840) with good calibration. Decision curve analysis further confirmed the clinical usefulness of the two nomograms for predicting IDH and ATRX status. Conclusions The nomogram incorporating age, gender, and the radiomics signature provided a clinically useful approach in noninvasively predicting IDH and ATRX mutation status for LrGG patients. The proposed method could facilitate MRI-based clinical decision-making for the LrGG patients. Key Points • Non-invasive determination of IDH and ATRX gene status of LrGG patients can be obtained with a radiomics nomogram. • The proposed nomogram is constructed by radiomics signature selected from 250 radiomics features, combined with age and gender. • The proposed radiomics nomogram exhibited good calibration and discrimination for IDH and ATRX gene mutation stratification of LrGG patients in both training and validation sets.","Shiman Wu,Shiman Wu,Xi Zhang,Xi Zhang,Wenting Rui,Wenting Rui,Yaru Sheng,Yaru Sheng,Yang Yang,Yang Yu,Yong Zhang,Yong Zhang,Zhenwei Yao,Zhenwei Yao,Tianming Qiu,Tianming Qiu,T.-m.

10.1117/12.2611501,,,A semi-automatic threshold-based segmentation algorithm for lung cancer delineation,"Radiomic studies utilize AI and quantitative features from medical images to create models that can predict patient outcomes. An integral step in these radiomic studies is the delineation of the regions of interest where the features are extracted. Manual segmentation is labor intensive and time-consuming for large studies. Semi-automatic segmentation tools have been used in recent radiomic studies to achieve more reproducible segmentations and robust radiomics features. However, for the segmentation of lung tumors on CT images, tools in the literature are difficult to find publicly and require extensive user interaction. Therefore, we aimed to build a semi-automatic segmentation tool which was intuitive, fast, and required minimal user interaction. We used one dataset to develop the segmentation algorithm on (n=49), and another to test its performance (n=144). All 144 tumors were segmented on the CT images using the semiautomatic tool by three separate users. A gold standard tumor delineation was determined by a trained radiologist. The segmentation robustness was assessed using the Dice, mean absolute boundary distance (MAD) and volume difference (VD). A total of 408 radiomic features were extracted and feature robustness was determined using an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) greater than 0.8. The developed tool achieved an average Dice of 0.90, MAD of 0.62 mm and a VD of 0.97 ml between the three users. A total of 181 (76%) of the extracted features displayed excellent reliability. This tool has the potential to augment the reliability of radiomic studies by making segmentations and feature sets more reproducible.","Jaryd R. Christie,Jaryd R.

10.1186/s12967-022-03298-7,35189890.0,,An artificial intelligence method to assess the tumor microenvironment with treatment outcomes for gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy,"Abstract Background The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in the occurrence and development of gastric cancer (GC) and is widely used to assess the treatment outcomes of GC patients. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene sequencing are the main analysis methods for the TME but are limited due to the subjectivity of observers, the high cost of equipment and the need for professional analysts. Methods The ImmunoScore (IS) was developed in the TCGA cohort and validated in GEO cohorts. The Radiomic ImmunoScore (RIS) was developed in the TCGA cohort and validated in the Nanfang cohort. A nomogram was developed and validated in the Nanfang cohort based on RIS and clinical features. Results For IS, the area under the curves (AUCs) were 0.798 for 2-year overall survival (OS) and 0.873 for 4-year overall survival. For RIS, in the TCGA cohort, the AUCs distinguishing High-IS or Low-IS and predicting prognosis were 0.85 and 0.81, respectively; in the Nanfang cohort, the AUC predicting prognosis was 0.72. The nomogram performed better than the TNM staging system according to the ROC curve (all P &lt; 0.01). Patients with TNM stage II and III in the High-nomogram group were more likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy than Low-nomogram group patients. Conclusions The RIS and the nomogram can be used to assess the TME, prognosis and adjuvant chemotherapy benefit of GC patients after radical gastrectomy and are valuable additions to the current TNM staging system. High-nomogram GC patients may benefit more from adjuvant chemotherapy than Low-nomogram GC patients.","Tao Chen,Tao Chen,Xiaoyun Nicole Li,Xunjun Li,Qingyi Mao,Qingyi Mao,Yiyun Wang,Yiyun Wang,Hanyi Li,Hui Li,Chen Wang,Chen Wang,Yefeng Shen,Yuyang Shen,Er‐Jia Guo,Erjia Guo,Qinglie He,Qinglie He,Jie Tian,Jie Tian,Mansheng Zhu,Man-Sheng Zhu,Jing Wu,Jia Wu,Weiqi Liang,Weiqi Liang,Hao Liu,Hao Líu,Jiang Yu,Jiang Yu,Guoxin Li,Guoxin Li",Journal of Translational Medicine,2022.0

Our aim was to evaluate the value of baseline MRI-based radiomics machine-learning models in predicting the disease progression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who achieved complete response after treatment. Methods In this retrospective study, 171 patients with pathologically confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma were included. Using hold-out cross validation scheme (7:3), relevant radiomic features were selected with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method based on baseline T2-weighted fat suppression and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images in the training cohort. After Pearson’s correlation analysis of selected radiomic features, multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to radiomic features and clinical characteristics selection. Logistic regression analysis and support vector machine classifier were utilized to build the predictive model respectively. The predictive accuracy of the model was evaluated by ROC analysis along with sensitivity, specificity and AUC calculated in the validation cohort. Results A prediction model using logistic regression analysis comprising 4 radiomics features (HGLZE_T2H, HGLZE_T1, LDLGLE_T1, and GLNU_T1) and 5 clinical features (histology, T stage, N stage, smoking history, and age) showed the best performance with an AUC of 0.75 in the training cohort (95% CI: 0.66–0.83) and 0.77 in the validation cohort (95% CI: 0.64–0.90). The nine independent impact factors were entered into the nomogram. The calibration curves for probability of 3-year disease progression showed good agreement. The features of this prediction model showed satisfactory clinical utility with decision curve analysis. Conclusions A radiomics model derived from pretreatment MR showed good performance for predicting disease progression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and may help to improve clinical decision making.","Dan Bao,Dan Bao,Zhou Liu,Zhou Liu,Yayuan Geng,Yayuan Geng,Li Li,Lin Li,Haijun Xu,Haijun Xu,Zhang Ya,Ya Zhang,Lei Hu,Lei Hu,Xinming Zhao,Xinming Zhao,Yanfeng Zhao,Yanfeng Zhao,Dehong Luo,Dingcun Luo",Cancer Imaging,2022.0
10.1259/bjr.20210792,35019776.0,,CT-Based radiomics model for preoperative prediction of hepatic encephalopathy after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt,"Objective: To develop and evaluate a machine learning-based CT radiomics model for the prediction of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Methods: A total of 106 patients who underwent TIPS placement were consecutively enrolled in this retrospective study. Region of interests (ROIs) were drawn on unenhanced, arterial phase, and portal venous Phase CT images, and radiomics features were extracted, respectively. A radiomics model was established to predict the occurrence of HE after TIPS by using random forest algorithm and ten-fold cross-validation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to validate the capability of the radiomics model and clinical model on the training, test and original datasets, respectively. Results: The radiomics model showed favorable discriminatory ability in the training cohort with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.899 (95% CI, 0.848 to 0.951), while in the test cohort, it was confirmed with an AUC of 0.887 (95% CI, 0.760 to 1.00). After applying this model to original dataset, it had an AUC of 0.955 (95% CI, 0.896 to 1.00). A clinical model was also built with an AUC of 0.649 (95% CI, 0.530 to 0.767) in the original dataset, and a Delong test demonstrated its relative lower efficiency when compared with the radiomics model (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Machine learning-based CT radiomics model performed better than traditional clinical parameter-based models in the prediction of post-TIPS HE. Advances in knowledge: Radiomics model for the prediction of post-TIPS HE was built based on feature extraction from routine acquired preoperative CT images and feature selection by random forest algorithm, which showed satisfied performance and proved the advantages of machine learning in this field.","Sihang Cheng,Sihang Cheng,Xiang Yu,Xiang Yu,Xinyue Chen,Xinyue Chen,Zhengyu Jin,Zhengyu Jin,Huadan Xue,Huadan Xue,Zhiwei Wang,Zhiwei Wang,Ping Xie,Ping Xie",British Journal of Radiology,2022.0

Methods Patients diagnosed with acute ischaemic stroke who underwent mechanical thrombectomy in 4 institutions from December 2017 to June 2020 were included in this retrospective study. The study population was divided into a training cohort and a validation cohort. The nonenhanced CT images taken after mechanical thrombectomy were used to extract radiomic features. The maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm was used to eliminate confounding variables. Afterwards, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was used to generate the radiomic signature. The diagnostic performance of the radiomic signature was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Results A total of 166 intraparenchymal areas of hyperattenuation from 101 patients were used. The areas of hyperattenuation were randomly allocated to the training and validation cohorts at a ratio of 7:3. The AUC of the radiomic signature was 0.848 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.780–0.917) in the training cohort and 0.826 (95% CI 0.705–0.948) in the validation cohort. The accuracy of the radiomic signature was 77.6%, with a sensitivity of 76.7%, a specificity of 78.9%, a PPV of 85.2%, and a NPV of 68.2% in the validation cohort. Conclusions The radiomic signature constructed based on initial post-operative nonenhanced CT after mechanical thrombectomy can effectively differentiate IPH from iodinated contrast extravasation. Key Points • Radiomic features were extracted from intraparenchymal areas of hyperattenuation on initial post-operative CT scans after mechanical thrombectomy. • The nonenhanced CT-based radiomic signature can differentiate IPH from iodinated contrast extravasation early. • The radiomic signature may help prevent unnecessary rescanning after mechanical thrombectomy, especially in cases where contrast extravasation is highly suggestive.","Xiaojun Chen,Xiaojun Chen,Yuanzhe Li,Yuan-Zhe Li,Yongjin Zhou,Ying Zhou,Yan Yang,Yan Yang,Jinzhong Yang,Jiansheng Yang,Peipei Pang,Peipei Pang,Yi Wang,Yi Wang,Jing Cheng,Jianmin Cheng,Haibo Chen,Hongbo Chen,Yifan Guo,Yifan Guo",European Radiology,2022.0

All PET/CT images were retrospectively reevaluated. Radiomics features of primary breast lesions reflecting tumor heterogeneity as well as standardized uptake value (SUV) metrics (SUVmin, SUVmean, SUVmax, and SUVpeak) and volumetric parameters such as metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were extracted by commercial texture analysis software package (LIFEx; https://www.lifexsoft.org/ index.php). WEKA and SPSS were used for statistical analysis. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine texture features predicting HR positivity. Accuracy, F-measure, precision, recall, and precision-recall curve area were used as data-mining performance criteria of texture features to predict HR positivity.None of the radiomics parameters were significant in predicting HR status. Only SUV metrics and TLG were statistically important. Mean ± standard deviations for SUVmean, SUVmax, and SUVpeak for the HR-negative group were significantly higher than those in the HR-positive group (6.73±4.36 vs. 5.20±3.32, p=0.027; 11.55±7.42 vs. 8.63±5.23, p=0.006; and 8.37±6.81 vs. 5.72±4.86; p=0.012). Cut-off values of SUVmean, SUVmax, and SUVpeak for the prediction of HR positivity were 4.93, 8.35, and 6.02, respectively. Among data-mining methods, logistic regression showed the best performance with accuracy of 0.762.In addition to the relatively limited number of patients in this study, radiomics parameters cannot predict the HR status of primary breast cancer.

10.1016/j.ctro.2022.01.003,,,"Cleaning Radiotherapy Contours for Radiomics Studies, is it Worth it? A Head and Neck Cancer Study","<h2>Abstract</h2> A vast majority of studies in the radiomics field are based on contours originating from radiotherapy planning. This kind of delineation (<i>e.g.</i> Gross Tumor Volume, GTV) is often larger than the true tumoral volume, sometimes including parts of other organs (<i>e.g.</i> trachea in Head and Neck, H&N studies) and the impact of such over-segmentation was little investigated so far. In this paper, we propose to evaluate and compare the performance between models using two contour types: those from radiotherapy planning, and those specifically delineated for radiomics studies. For the latter, we modified the radiotherapy contours to fit the true tumoral volume. The two contour types were compared when predicting Progression-Free Survival (PFS) using Cox models based on radiomics features extracted from FluoroDeoxyGlucose-Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) and CT images of 239 patients with oropharyngeal H&N cancer collected from five centers, the data from the 2020 HECKTOR challenge. Using <i>Dedicated</i> contours demonstrated better performance for predicting PFS, where Harell's concordance indices of 0<i>.</i>61 and 0<i>.</i>69 were achieved for <i>Radiotherapy</i> and <i>Dedicated</i> contours, respectively. Using automatically <i>Resegmented</i> contours based on a fixed intensity range was associated with a C-index of 0.63. These results illustrate the importance of using clean dedicated contours that are close to the true tumoral volume in radiomics studies, even when tumor contours are already available from radiotherapy treatment planning.","Pierre Fontaine,Pierre Fontaine,Vincent Andrearczyk,Vincent Andrearczyk,Valentin Oreiller,Valentin Oreiller,Daniel Abler,Daniel Abler,Joël Castelli,J.

It can explore the influence of the above factors on the prognosis of rectal cancer from multi-level and multi-angle. • The proposed radiomics nomogram showed better prognostic performance than the clinicopathological and imaging model in risk stratification and can classify patients into high- and low-risk groups with significant differences in OS. We compared the ability of a radiomics model, morphological imaging model, and clinicopathological risk model to predict 3-year overall survival (OS) in 206 patients with rectal cancer who underwent radical surgery and had magnetic resonance imaging, clinicopathological, and OS data available. The patients were randomized to a training cohort ( n = 146) and a verification cohort ( n = 60). Radiomics features were extracted from preoperative T2-weighted images, and a radiomics score model was constructed. Factors that were significant in the Cox multivariate analysis were used to construct the final morphological tumor model and clinicopathological model. A comprehensive model in the form of a line chart was established by combining the three models. Ten radiomics features significantly related to OS were selected to construct the radiomics feature model and calculate the radiomics score. In the morphological model, mesorectal extension depth and distance between the lower tumor margin and the anal margin were significant prognostic factors. N stage was the only significant clinicopathological factor. The comprehensive model combined with the above factors had the best prediction performance for OS. The C-index had a predictive performance of 0.872 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.832–0.912) in the training cohort and 0.944 (95% CI: 0.890–0.990) in the verification cohort, which was better than for any single model. The comprehensive model was divided into high-risk and low-risk groups. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that all factors were significantly correlated with poor OS in the high-risk group.

The phantom was scanned at 18 doses from 0.2 to 4 mGy, with 20 repeated scans per dose. Images were reconstructed with FBP, AIDR 3D, FIRST, and AiCE. Ninety-three radiomics features were extracted from 24 regions of interest, which were evenly distributed across three tissue classes: normal liver, metastatic core, and metastatic rim. Features were analyzed in terms of their consistent characterization of tissues within the same image (intraclass correlation coefficient ≥ 0.75), discriminative power (Kruskal-Wallis test p value < 0.05), and repeatability (overall concordance correlation coefficient ≥ 0.75).The median fraction of consistent features across all doses was 6%, 8%, 6%, and 22% with FBP, AIDR 3D, FIRST, and AiCE, respectively. Adequate discriminative power was achieved by 48%, 82%, 84%, and 92% of features, and 52%, 20%, 17%, and 39% of features were repeatable, respectively. Only 5% of features combined consistency, discriminative power, and repeatability with FBP, AIDR 3D, and FIRST versus 13% with AiCE at doses above 1 mGy and 17% at doses ≥ 3 mGy. AiCE was the only reconstruction technique that enabled extraction of higher-order features.AiCE more than doubled the yield of radiomics features at doses typically used clinically. Inconsistent tissue characterization within CT images contributes significantly to the poor stability of radiomics features.• Image quality of CT images reconstructed with filtered back projection and iterative methods is inadequate for the majority of radiomics features due to inconsistent tissue characterization, low discriminative power, or low repeatability. • Deep learning reconstruction enhances image quality for radiomics and more than doubled the feature yield at doses that are typically used in clinical CT imaging. • Image reconstruction algorithms can optimize image quality for more reliable quantification of tissues in CT images.","Florian Michallek,Florian Michallek,Ulrich Genske,Ulrich Genske,Stefan M.

Methods We retrospectively enrolled 306 patients within PI-RADS 3 lesion from January 2015 to July 2020 in institution 1; the enrolled patients were randomly divided into the training group (n = 199) and test group (n = 107). Radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging. Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was used to address the class imbalance. The ANOVA and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model were used for feature selection and radiomics signature building. Then, a radiomics score (Rad-score) was acquired. Combined with serum prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) level, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to construct a radiomics nomogram. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate radiomics signature and nomogram. The radiomics nomogram calibration and clinical usefulness were estimated through calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). External validation was assessed, and the independent validation cohort contained 65 patients within PI-RADS 3 lesion from January 2020 to July 2021 in institution 2. Results A total of 75 (24.5%) and 16 (24.6%) patients had CsPCa in institution 1 and 2, respectively. The radiomics signature with SMOTE augmentation method had a higher area under the ROC curve (AUC) [0.840 (95% CI, 0.776–0.904)] than that without SMOTE method [0.730 (95% CI, 0.624–0.836), p = 0.08] in the test group and significantly increased in the external validation group [0.834 (95% CI, 0.709–0.959) vs. 0.718 (95% CI, 0.562–0.874), p = 0.017].

10.1186/s12967-022-03233-w,,,Development of a radiomics model to diagnose pheochromocytoma preoperatively: a multicenter study with prospective validation,"Abstract Background Preoperative diagnosis of pheochromocytoma (PHEO) accurately impacts preoperative preparation and surgical outcome in PHEO patients. Highly reliable model to diagnose PHEO is lacking. We aimed to develop a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomic-clinical model to distinguish PHEO from adrenal lesions. Methods In total, 305 patients with 309 adrenal lesions were included and divided into different sets. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used for data dimension reduction, feature selection, and radiomics signature building. In addition, a nomogram incorporating the obtained radiomics signature and selected clinical predictors was developed by using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The performance of the radiomic-clinical model was assessed with respect to its discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. Results Seven radiomics features were selected among the 1301 features obtained as they could differentiate PHEOs from other adrenal lesions in the training (area under the curve [AUC], 0.887), internal validation (AUC, 0.880), and external validation cohorts (AUC, 0.807). Predictors contained in the individualized prediction nomogram included the radiomics signature and symptom number (symptoms include headache, palpitation, and diaphoresis). The training set yielded an AUC of 0.893 for the nomogram, which was confirmed in the internal and external validation sets with AUCs of 0.906 and 0.844, respectively. Decision curve analyses indicated the nomogram was clinically useful. In addition, 25 patients with 25 lesions were recruited for prospective validation, which yielded an AUC of 0.917 for the nomogram. Conclusion We propose a radiomic-based nomogram incorporating clinically useful signatures as an easy-to-use, predictive and individualized tool for PHEO diagnosis.","Jianqiu Kong,Jianqiu Kong,Junjiong Zheng,Junjiong Zheng,Jieying Wu,Jieying Wu,Shaoxu Wu,Shaoxu Wu,Jinhua Cai,Jinhua Cai,Xiayao Diao,Xiayao Diao,Weibin Xie,Weibin Xie,Xiong Chen,Xiong Chen,Hao Yu,Hao Yu,Lifang Huang,Lifang Huang,Hongpeng Fang,Hongpeng Fang,Xinxiang Fan,Xinxiang Fan,Haide Qin,Haide Qin,Yong Li,Yong Li,Zhuo Wu,Zhuo Wu,Jian Huang,Jian Huang,Tianxin Lin,Tianxin Lin",Journal of Translational Medicine,2022.0
10.3390/cancers14041079,,,External Validation of a Radiomics Model for the Prediction of Complete Response to Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Rectal Cancer,"Objective: Our objective was to develop a radiomics model based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant treatment in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Material: All patients treated for a LARC with neoadjuvant CRT and subsequent surgery in two separate institutions between 2012 and 2019 were considered. Both pre-CRT pelvic MRI and CE-CT were mandatory for inclusion. The tumor was manually segmented on the T2-weighted and diffusion axial MRI sequences and on CE-CT. In total, 88 radiomic parameters were extracted from each sequence using the Miras© software, with a total of 822 features by patient. The cohort was split into training (Institution 1) and testing (Institution 2) sets. The ComBat and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) approaches were used to account for inter-institution heterogeneity and imbalanced data, respectively. We selected the most predictive characteristics using Spearman’s rank correlation and the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Five pCR prediction models (clinical, radiomics before and after ComBat, and combined before and after ComBat) were then developed on the training set with a neural network approach and a bootstrap internal validation (n = 1000 replications). A cut-off maximizing the model’s performance was defined on the training set. Each model was then evaluated on the testing set using sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy (Bacc) with the predefined cut-off. Results: Out of the 124 included patients, 14 had pCR (11.3%). After ComBat harmonization, the radiomic and the combined models obtained a Bacc of 68.2% and 85.5%, respectively, while the clinical model and the pre-ComBat combined achieved respective Baccs of 60.0% and 75.5%. Conclusions: After correction of inter-site variability and imbalanced data, addition of radiomic features enhances the prediction of pCR after neoadjuvant CRT in LARC.","Anaïs Bordron,A.

Pathological cross-section samples of 350 plaques were collected and coregistered to patients’ preoperative CCTA images. A total of 1184 radiomic features were extracted from CCTA images. Through feature selection and stratified fivefold cross-validation, we derived eight radiomics-based ML models for lesion vulnerability prediction. An independent set of 196 plaques from another 8 CAD patients who underwent heart transplants was collected to validate radiomics-based ML models’ diagnostic accuracy against conventional CCTA feature-based diagnosis (presence of at least 2 high-risk plaque features). The performance of the prediction models was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).ResultsThe training group used to develop radiomics-based ML models contained 200/350 (57.1%) vulnerable plaques and the external validation group was composed of 67.3% (132/196) vulnerable plaques. The radiomics-based ML model based on eight radiomic features showed excellent cross-validation diagnostic accuracy (AUC: 0.900 ± 0.033). In the validation group, diagnosis based on conventional CCTA features demonstrated moderate performance (AUC: 0.656 [95% CI: 0.593 –0.718]), while the radiomics-based ML model showed higher diagnostic ability (0.782 [95% CI: 0.710 –0.846]).ConclusionsRadiomics-based ML models showed better diagnostic ability than the conventional CCTA features at assessing coronary plaque vulnerability.Key Points • CCTA has great potential in the diagnosis of vulnerable coronary artery lesions. • Radiomics model built through CCTA could discriminate coronary vulnerable lesions in good diagnostic ability. • Radiomics model could improve the ability of vulnerability diagnosis against traditional CCTA method, sensitivity especially.","Xiang-Cheng Li,Xiangnan Li,Yin Wang,Weihua Yin,Yang Sun,Yang Sun,Han Kang,Kang Han,Jie Luo,Jie Luo,Kuan Chen,Kuan Chen,Zhihui Hou,Zhiyong Hou,Yang Gao,Yang Gao,Xiaoyu Ren,Xin-Shuang Ren,Yi-Tong Yu,Yitong Yu,Yunqiang An,Yun-Qiang An,Yan Zhang,Yao-Jun Zhang,Shao-Liang Chen,Hongyue Wang,Hong-Yue Wang,Bin Lu,Bin Lü",European Radiology,2022.0

10.3748/wjg.v28.i6.608,,,"Is precision medicine for colorectal liver metastases still a utopia? New perspectives by modern biomarkers, radiomics, and artificial intelligence","The management of patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer is still debated. Several therapeutic options and treatment strategies are available for an extremely heterogeneous clinical scenario. Adequate prediction of patients' outcomes and of the effectiveness of chemotherapy and loco-regional treatments are crucial to reach a precision medicine approach. This has been an unmet need for a long time, but recent studies have opened new perspectives. New morphological biomarkers have been identified. The dynamic evaluation of the metastases across a time interval, with or without chemotherapy, provided a reliable assessment of the tumor biology. Genetics have been explored and, thanks to their strong association with prognosis, have the potential to drive treatment planning. The liver-tumor interface has been identified as one of the main determinants of tumor progression, and its components, in particular the immune infiltrate, are the focus of major research. Image mining and analyses provided new insights on tumor biology and are expected to have a relevant impact on clinical practice. Artificial intelligence is a further step forward. The present paper depicts the evolution of clinical decision-making for patients affected by colorectal liver metastases, facing modern biomarkers and innovative opportunities that will characterize the evolution of clinical research and practice in the next few years.","Luca Viganò,Luca Viganò,Visala S Jayakody Arachchige,Visala S Jayakody Arachchige,Francesco Fiz,Francesco Fiz",World Journal of Gastroenterology,2022.0

10.3390/jpm12020143,,,Locoregional Recurrence Prediction Using a Deep Neural Network of Radiological and Radiotherapy Images,"Radiation therapy (RT) is an important and potentially curative modality for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Locoregional recurrence (LR) of HNSCC after RT is ranging from 15% to 50% depending on the primary site and stage. In addition, the 5-year survival rate of patients with LR is low. To classify high-risk patients who might develop LR, a deep learning model for predicting LR needs to be established. In this work, 157 patients with HNSCC who underwent RT were analyzed. Based on the National Cancer Institute's multi-institutional TCIA data set containing FDG-PET/CT/dose, a 3D deep learning model was proposed to predict LR without time-consuming segmentation or feature extraction. Our model achieved an averaged area under the curve (AUC) of 0.856. Adding clinical factors into the model improved the AUC to an average of 0.892 with the highest AUC of up to 0.974. The 3D deep learning model could perform individualized risk quantification of LR in patients with HNSCC without time-consuming tumor segmentation.","Kyumin Han,Kyumin Han,Joonyoung F.

10.1148/radiol.211986,35133200.0,,MRI Radiomics Model Predicts Pathologic Complete Response of Rectal Cancer Following Chemoradiotherapy,"Background Preoperative assessment of pathologic complete response (pCR) in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is increasingly needed for organ preservation, but large-scale validation of an MRI radiomics model remains lacking. Purpose To evaluate radiomics models based on T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted MRI for predicting pCR after nCRT in LARC and compare their performance with visual assessment by radiologists. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients with LARC (clinical stage T3 or higher, positive nodal status, or both) who underwent post-nCRT MRI and elective resection between January 2009 and December 2018. Surgical histopathologic analysis was the reference standard for pCR. Radiomic features were extracted from the volume of interest on T2-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps from post-nCRT MRI to generate three models: T2 weighted, ADC, and both T2 weighted and ADC (merged). Radiomics signatures were generated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with tenfold cross-validation. Three experienced radiologists independently rated tumor regression grades at MRI and compared these with the radiomics models’ diagnostic outcomes. Areas under the curve (AUCs) of the radiomics models and pooled readers were compared by using the DeLong method. Results Among 898 patients, 189 (21%) achieved pCR. The patients were chronologically divided into training (n = 592; mean age ± standard deviation, 59 years ± 12; 388 men) and test (n = 306; mean age, 59 years ± 12; 190 men) sets. The radiomics signatures of the T2-weighted, ADC, and merged models demonstrated AUCs of 0.82, 0.79, and 0.82, respectively, with no evidence of a difference found between the T2-weighted and merged models (P = .49), while the ADC model performed worse than the merged model (P = .02). The T2-weighted model had higher classification performance (AUC, 0.82 vs 0.74 [P = .009]) and sensitivity (80.0% vs 15.6% [P < .001]), but lower specificity (68.4% vs 98.6% [P < .001]) than the pooled performance of the three radiologists. Conclusion An MRI-based radiomics model showed better classification performance than experienced radiologists for diagnosing pathologic complete response in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. © RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

The region of interest was extracted from MRI images using radiomics, and the hilar lesion model was constructed based on a convolutional neural network.There were significant differences in respiration and pulse frequency between patients with hilar lesions and without hilar lesions (P <0.05). The subjective scores of the images in the first three phases of dynamic enhanced scanning in the training set were higher than those in the validation set (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the training and validation set in the last three phases of dynamic enhanced scanning.Machine learn-based MRI LAVA dynamic enhanced scanning for diagnosing hilar lesions has high diagnostic efficiency and can be used as an auxiliary diagnostic method.","Haijin Wang,Wang Hai-jin,Song Wang,Song Wang,Lihua Zhou,Lihua Zhou",Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,2022.0
10.3390/curroncol29030114,,,Methods of Sentinel Lymph Node Detection and Management in Urinary Bladder Cancer—A Narrative Review,"Introduction: Detection of lymph node status in bladder cancer significantly impacts clinical decisions regarding its management. There is a wide range of detection modalities for this task, including lymphoscintigraphy, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and fluoroscopy. We aimed to study the pre- and intraoperative detection modalities of sentinel lymph nodes in urinary bladder cancer. Method: This narrative review was performed by searching the PubMed and EMBASE libraries using the following search terms: (“Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder” OR “urothelial cancer” OR “urinary bladder cancer” OR “bladder cancer”) AND ((“sentinel lymph node”) OR (“lymphatic mapping”) OR (“lymphoscintigraphy”) OR (“lymphangiography”) OR (“lymph node metastases”)). Studies analysing the effectiveness and outcomes of sentinel lymph node detection in bladder cancer were included, while non-English language, duplicates, and non-article studies were excluded. After analysing the libraries and a further manual search of bibliographies, 31 studies were included in this paper. We followed the RAMESES publication standard for narrative reviews to produce this paper. Results: Of the 31 studies included, 7 studies included multiple detection methods; 5 studies included lymphoscintigraphy; 5 studies included computed tomography and/or single-photon emission computed tomography; 5 studies included fluoroscopy; 4 studies included magnetic resonance imaging; and 5 studies included positron emission tomography. Discussion: Anatomical, radioactive, and functional detection modalities have been studied independently and in combination. The consensus is that preoperative detection with imaging helps guide surgical management and intraoperative detection methods help capture any lymph nodes that may have been missed. Each of these types of detection represent their own set of benefits and drawbacks, but there is currently limited evidence to support any change in overall practice to replace conventional staging.","Ankit Kumar Sinha,Ankit Sinha,Alexander West,Alexander West,John Hayes,John Hayes,Jeremy Yuen-Chun Teoh,Jeremy Yuen‐Chun Teoh,Jeremy Yuen-Chun,Karel Decaestecker,Karel Decaestecker,Nikhil Vasdev,Nikhil Vasdev",Current Oncology,2022.0

In this study, a clini-radiomic model combining radiomic and clinical features was used to distinguish intracranial hemangiopericytoma and hemangioma meningioma preoperatively. Methods A total of 147 patients with intracranial hemangiopericytoma and 73 patients with angiomatous meningioma from the Tiantan Hospital were retrospectively reviewed and randomly assigned to training and validation sets. Radiomic features were extracted from MR images, the elastic net and recursive feature elimination algorithms were applied to select radiomic features for constructing a fusion radiomic model. Subsequently, multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to construct a clinical model, then a clini-radiomic model incorporating the fusion radiomic model and clinical features was constructed for individual predictions. The calibration, discriminating capacity, and clinical usefulness were also evaluated.

In the present study, we aimed to construct a multiparametric MRI-derived radiomic signature for predicting DFS of LACC patients who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Methods This multicenter retrospective study recruited 263 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obetrics (FIGO) stage IB-IVA treated with CCRT for whom pretreatment MRI scans were performed. They were randomly divided into two groups: primary cohort (n = 178) and validation cohort (n = 85). The LASSO regression and Cox proportional hazard regression were conducted to construct the radiomic signature (RS). According to the cutoff of the RS value, patients were dichotomized into low- and high-risk groups. Pearson’s correlation and Kaplan–Meier analysis were conducted to evaluate the association between the RS and DFS. The RS, the clinical model incorporating FIGO stage and lymph node metastasis by the multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, and a combined model incorporating RS and clinical model were constructed to estimate DFS individually. Results The final radiomic signature consisted of four radiomic features: T2W _wavelet-LH_ glszm_Size Zone NonUniformity , ADC _wavelet-HL-first order_ Median , ADC _wavelet-HH-glrlm_Long Run Low Gray Level Emphasis , and ADC _wavelet _LL_gldm_Large Dependence High Gray Emphasis . Higher RS was significantly associated with worse DFS in the primary and validation cohorts (both p&amp;lt;0.001). The RS demonstrated better prognostic performance in predicting DFS than the clinical model in both cohorts (C-index, 0.736–0.758 for RS, and 0.603–0.649 for clinical model). However, the combined model showed no significant improvement (C-index, 0.648, 95% CI, 0.571–0.685). Conclusions The present study indicated that the multiparametric MRI-derived radiomic signature could be used as a non-invasive prognostic tool for predicting DFS in LACC patients.","Bing Liu,Bing Liu,Zhen Sun,Zhen Sun,Zhibo Xu,Zi-Liang Xu,Hongfeng Zhao,Hong-Liang Zhao,Didi Wen,Di-Di Wen,Yong'ai Li,Yueyue Li,Fan Zhang,Fan Zhang,Bing-Xin Hou,Bing-Xin Hou,Huan Yi,Yi Huan,Lichun Wei,Li-Chun Wei,Ming–Hua Zheng,Minwen Zheng",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0

For qualitative synthesis, details regarding study design, aim, sample size and imaging modality were recorded as well as those regarding the radiomics pipeline (e.g., segmentation and feature extraction strategy). The methodological quality of each study was evaluated using the radiomics quality score (RQS). After duplicate removal and selection criteria application, 25 full-text articles were included and evaluated. All were retrospective studies, mostly based on CT images (17/25, 68%), with manual (19/25, 76%) and two-dimensional segmentation (13/25, 52%) being preferred. Machine learning was paired to radiomics in about half of the studies (12/25, 48%).

Our purpose in this narrative review is to offer an overview of radiomics studies dealing with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based radiomics models of bone and soft-tissue sarcomas that could help distinguish different histotypes, low-grade from high-grade sarcomas, predict response to multimodality therapy, and thus better tailor patients’ treatments and finally improve their survivals. Although showing promising results, interobserver segmentation variability, feature reproducibility, and model validation are three main challenges of radiomics that need to be addressed in order to translate radiomics studies to clinical applications. These efforts, together with a better knowledge and application of the “Radiomics Quality Score” and Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative reporting guidelines, could improve the quality of sarcoma radiomics studies and facilitate radiomics towards clinical translation.","Cristiana Fanciullo,Cristiana Fanciullo,Salvatore Gitto,Salvatore Gitto,Eleonora Carlicchi,Eleonora Carlicchi,Domenico Albano,Domenico Albano,Carmelo Messina,Carmelo Messina,Luca Maria Sconfienza,Luca Maria Sconfienza",Journal of Imaging,2022.0
10.1186/s41747-021-00258-6,,,Reproducibility of radiomic features in CT images of NSCLC patients: an integrative analysis on the impact of acquisition and reconstruction parameters,"Abstract Background We investigated to what extent tube voltage, scanner model, and reconstruction algorithm affect radiomic feature reproducibility in a single-institution retrospective database of computed tomography images of non-small-cell lung cancer patients. Methods This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (UID 2412). Images of 103 patients were considered, being acquired on either among two scanners, at 100 or 120 kVp. For each patient, images were reconstructed with six iterative blending levels, and 1414 features were extracted from each reconstruction. At univariate analysis, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was applied to evaluate feature differences within scanners and voltages, whereas the impact of the reconstruction was established with the overall concordance correlation coefficient (OCCC). A multivariable mixed model was also applied to investigate the independent contribution of each acquisition/reconstruction parameter. Univariate and multivariable analyses were combined to analyse feature behaviour. Results Scanner model and voltage did not affect features significantly. The reconstruction blending level showed a significant impact at both univariate analysis (154/1414 features yielding an OCCC &lt; 0.85) and multivariable analysis, with most features (1042/1414) revealing a systematic trend with the blending level (multiple comparisons adjusted p &lt; 0.05). Reproducibility increased in association to image processing with smooth filters, nonetheless specific investigation in relation to clinical endpoints should be performed to ensure that textural information is not removed. Conclusions Combining univariate and multivariable models is allowed to identify features for which corrections may be applied to reduce the trend with the algorithm and increase reproducibility. Subsequent clustering may be applied to eliminate residual redundancy.","Lisa Rinaldi,Lisa Rinaldi,Simone P.

Methods A standardized phantom with sixteen rods of clinical-relevant densities was scanned on seven DECT-capable scanners and three SECT-only scanners. The acquisition parameters were selected to present typical abdomen-pelvic examinations with the same voxel size. Images of SECT at 120 kVp and corresponding 120 kVp-like virtual monochromatic images (VMIs) in DECT which were generated according to scanners were analyzed. Regions of interest were drawn with rigid registrations to avoid variations due to segmentation. Radiomics features were extracted via Pyradiomics platform. Test-retest repeatability was evaluated by Bland-Altman analysis for repeated scans. Intra-scanner reproducibility for different scan modes was tested by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). Inter-scanner reproducibility among different scanners for same scan mode was assessed by coefficient of variation (CV) and quartile coefficient of dispersion (QCD). Results The test-retest analysis presented that 92.91% and 87.02% of the 94 assessed features were repeatable for SECT 120kVp and DECT 120 kVp-like VMIs, respectively. The intra-scanner analysis for SECT 120kVp vs DECT 120 kVp-like VMIs demonstrated that 10.76% and 10.28% of features were with ICC &gt; 0.90 and CCC &gt; 0.90, respectively. The inter-scanner analysis showed that 17.09% and 27.73% of features for SECT 120kVp were with CV &lt; 10% and QCD &lt; 10%, and 15.16% and 32.78% for DECT 120 kVp-like VMIs, respectively. Conclusions The majority of radiomics features were non-reproducible within and between SECT and DECT. Key Points • Although the test-retest analysis showed high repeatability for radiomics features, the overall reproducibility of radiomics features within and between SECT and DECT was low. • Only about one-tenth of radiomics features extracted from SECT images and corresponding DECT images did match each other, even their average photon energy levels were considered alike, indicating that the scan mode potentially altered the radiomics features. • Less than one-fifth of radiomics features were reproducible among multiple SECT and DECT scanners, regardless of their fixed acquisition and reconstruction parameters, suggesting the necessity of scanning protocol adjustment and post-scan harmonization process.","Yong Chen,Yong Chen,Jingyu Zhong,Jingyu Zhong,Lan Wang,Lingyun Wang,Xiaomeng Shi,Xiaomeng Shi,Wei Lu,Wei Lü,Jing Li,Jianying Li,Jianxing Feng,Jianxing Feng,Yunyan Xia,Yihan Xia,Rui Chang,Rui Chang,J Fan,Jing Fan,Liwei Chen,Liwei Chen,Ying Zhu,Ying Zhu,Fuhua Yan,Fuhua Yan,Weiwu Yao,Weiwu Yao,Huan Zhang,Huan Zhang",European Radiology,2022.0

Image segmentation was performed manually by three readers blinded to each other’s results. For each radiomics feature, we created two datasets by sorting measurements according to size, i.e., (i) from the smallest to the largest lesion and (ii) from the largest to the smallest lesion. The Lin concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was employed to analyze the reproducibility of radiomics features. In particular, the CCC was computed as a function of a number of elements in the dataset, by gradually adding lesions from each sorted dataset. To evaluate the effect of lesion size, we analyzed the difference between these two functions thus assessing the contribution of small and large lesions into the reproducibility of radiomics features.ResultsInter-reader reproducibility of CT-based 2D radiomics features assessed using Lin’s CCC demonstrates tumor-size dependence. For example, the Lin CCC for GLCM contrast equals 0.88 (95% C.I. 0.84 to 0.92, p < 0.003) and could change by an additional + / − 0.06 depending on the presence of large or small lesions.ConclusionsGroups of “large” and “small” lesions show different inter-reader reproducibility. The inter-reader reproducibility from the mixed group consisting of “large” and “small” lesions depends on the lesion-size distribution and can vary widely. This finding could partially explain variability in reproducibility of radiomics features in the literature.Key Points• Groups of “large” and “small” lesions show different inter-reader reproducibility.• The inter-reader reproducibility from the mixed group consisting of “large” and “small” lesions depends on the lesion-size distribution.","Linda C Kelahan,Linda C.

At its essence, the primary role of a clinical trial is to monitor a patient longitudinally using the diagnostic disciplines (radiology, pathology and laboratory medicine) to assess clinical outcomes. As the diagnostic fields have begun to fully digitalise, large volumes of data are being generated per patient – creating a ripe environment for the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI). In recent years, AI has found multiple applications in the medical field, most notably in radiology.

Besides, advanced neuroimaging is increasingly used to non-invasively provide detailed insights into the molecular and metabolic features of meningiomas. These techniques are usually based on MRI, e.g., perfusion-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, MR spectroscopy, and positron emission tomography. Furthermore, artificial intelligence methods such as radiomics offer the potential to extract quantitative imaging features from routinely acquired anatomical MRI and CT scans and advanced imaging techniques. This allows the linking of imaging phenotypes to meningioma characteristics, e.g., the molecular-genetic profile. Here, we review several diagnostic applications and future directions of these advanced neuroimaging techniques, including radiomics in preclinical models and patients with meningioma.","Norbert Galldiks,Norbert Galldiks,N.

EGFR mutations and the Ki-67 proliferation index were measured from tumor tissues. A total of 1,287 radiomic features were extracted, and a three-stage feature selection method was implemented to acquire the most valuable radiomic features. Finally, the radiomic scores and nomograms of the two tasks were established and tested. Receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curves were used to evaluate their prediction performance and clinical utility.In task [1], smoking status and histological type were significantly associated with EGFR mutations. After feature selection, 10 features were used to establish radiomic score, which showed good performance [area under the curve (AUC) =0.800] in the validation cohort. The radiomic nomogram had an AUC of 0.798 (95% CI: 0.664 to 0.931) with a C-index of 0.798 in the validation cohort. In task [2], gender, smoking status, histological type, and stage showed a significant correlation with Ki-67 proliferation index expression.

10.3389/fonc.2022.861638,,,18F-FDG PET Radiomics as Predictor of Treatment Response in Oesophageal Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"The best treatment strategy for oesophageal cancer patients achieving a complete clinical response after neoadjuvant chemoradiation is a burning topic. The available diagnostic tools, such as 18F-FDG PET/CT performed routinely, cannot accurately evaluate the presence or absence of the residual tumour. The emerging field of radiomics may encounter the critical challenge of personalised treatment. Radiomics is based on medical image analysis, executed by extracting information from many image features; it has been shown to provide valuable information for predicting treatment responses in oesophageal cancer. This systematic review with a meta-analysis aims to provide current evidence of 18F-FDG PET-based radiomics in predicting response treatments following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in oesophageal cancer. A comprehensive literature review identified 1160 studies, of which five were finally included in the study. Our findings provided that pooled Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the five selected studies was relatively high at 0.821 (95% CI: 0.737–0.904) and not influenced by the sample size of the studies. Radiomics models exhibited a good performance in predicting pathological complete responses (pCRs). This review further strengthens the great potential of 18F-FDG PET-based radiomics to predict pCRs in oesophageal cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Additionally, our review imparts additional support to prospective studies on 18F-FDG PET radiomics for a tailored treatment strategy of oesophageal cancer patients.

10.3390/life12040586,,,A Spotlight on the Role of Radiomics and Machine-Learning Applications in the Management of Intracranial Meningiomas: A New Perspective in Neuro-Oncology: A Review,"Background: In recent decades, the application of machine learning technologies to medical imaging has opened up new perspectives in neuro-oncology, in the so-called radiomics field. Radiomics offer new insight into glioma, aiding in clinical decision-making and patients’ prognosis evaluation. Although meningiomas represent the most common primary CNS tumor and the majority of them are benign and slow-growing tumors, a minor part of them show a more aggressive behavior with an increased proliferation rate and a tendency to recur. Therefore, their treatment may represent a challenge. Methods: According to PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature review was performed. We included selected articles (meta-analysis, review, retrospective study, and case–control study) concerning the application of radiomics method in the preoperative diagnostic and prognostic algorithm, and planning for intracranial meningiomas. We also analyzed the contribution of radiomics in differentiating meningiomas from other CNS tumors with similar radiological features. Results: In the first research stage, 273 papers were identified. After a careful screening according to inclusion/exclusion criteria, 39 articles were included in this systematic review. Conclusions: Several preoperative features have been identified to increase preoperative intracranial meningioma assessment for guiding decision-making processes. The development of valid and reliable non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic modalities could have a significant clinical impact on meningioma treatment.","Lara Brunasso,Lara Brunasso,Gianluca Ferini,Gianluca Ferini,Lapo Bonosi,Roberta Costanzo,Lapo Bonosi,Sofia Musso,Roberta Costanzo,Umberto Emanuele Benigno,Sofia Musso,Rosa Maria Gerardi,Umberto E.

Methods The aorta was manually segmented on FDG PET–CT in 50 patients with aortitis and 25 controls. Radiomic features (RF) ( n = 107), including SUV (Standardized Uptake Value) metrics, were extracted from the segmented data and harmonized using the ComBat technique. Individual RFs and groups of RFs (i.e., signatures) were used as input in Machine Learning classifiers. The diagnostic utility of these classifiers was evaluated with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy using the clinical diagnosis as the ground truth. Results Several RFs had high accuracy, 84% to 86%, and AUC scores 0.83 to 0.97 when used individually. Radiomic signatures performed similarly, AUC 0.80 to 1.00. Conclusion A methodological framework for a radiomic-based approach to support diagnosis of aortitis was outlined. Selected RFs, individually or in combination, showed similar performance to the current standard of qualitative assessment in terms of AUC for identifying active aortitis. This framework could support development of a clinical decision-making tool for a more objective and standardized assessment of aortitis.","Lisa Duff,Lisa Duff,Andrew F.

In this study, we aimed to propose a new scheme of global feature management independent of dimension reduction to improve it.The non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) images of acute brainstem infarction (ABI) from two medical centers were used as test and validation sets. A new scheme was constructed based on global feature management, and the traditional scheme dependent on dimension reduction was used as control. The radiomic features of NCCT images were extracted in Matlab R2013a. The performance of prediction model was evaluated by the generalized linear model (GLM) and multivariate logistic regression. And, the stability of radiomics model was evaluated with the difference of area under curve (AUC) between the test and validation sets.Compared with the traditional scheme, the new scheme presented a similar detection performance (AUC: 0.875 vs. 0.883), yet a better performance in predicting prognosis (AUC: 0.864, OR = 0.917, p = 0.021 vs. AUC:0.806, OR = 0.972, p = 0.007).

Moreover, the new scheme showed stronger stability in both the detection model (ΔAUC: 0.013 vs. 0.039) and prediction model (ΔAUC = 0.004 vs. 0.044).Although there might be several limitations, this study proved that the scheme of global feature management independent of dimension reduction could be a powerful supplement to the radiomics methodology.• The new scheme (Swavelet) presented similar detection performances for ABI with the traditional scheme. • A better predictive performance for END was found in the new scheme (Swavelet) compared with the traditional scheme. • Stronger model stability was found in both the detection and prediction models based on the new scheme.","Yuefeng Li,Yuefeng Li,Yuhang Xie,Yuhang Xie,Yuhao Xu,Yijuan Xu,Ningning Zhang,Ningning Zhang,Guohai Li,Guohai Li,Shenghong Ju,Shenghong Ju",European Radiology,2022.0
10.1111/jgh.15841,35357026.0,,A nomogram-based model and ultrasonic radiomic features for gallbladder polyp classification.,"Gallbladder polyps (GBPs) are relatively common. Many studies have attempted to distinguish between benign and neoplastic GBPs to identify early-stage gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). We have established an accurate neoplastic predictive model and evaluated the effectiveness of radiomics in predicting malignancy in patients with GBPs.A total of 503 patients confirmed through postoperative pathology were included in this retrospective study. Clinical information and ultrasonographic findings were retrospectively analyzed. The model was constructed from independent risk factors using Spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis of a training cohort of 250 GBP patients, and its efficacy was verified using an internal validation group of 253 consecutive patients through the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). The area of GBPs was delimited manually, and the texture features of ultrasound images were analyzed using correlation and ROC analysis.Independent predictors, including age, gallstones, carcinoembryonic antigen, polyp size, and sessile shape, were incorporated into the nomogram model for the neoplastic potential of GBPs. Compared with other proposed prediction methods, the established nomogram model showed good discrimination ability in the training group (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.865) and validation group (AUC: 0.845). Regarding ultrasonic radiomics, the minimum caliper diameter was identified as the only independent predictor (AUC :0.841).Our preoperative nomogram model can successfully evaluate the neoplastic potential of GBPs using simple clinical data, and our study verified the use of radiomics in GBP identification, which may be valuable for avoiding unnecessary surgery in patients.","Xudong Zhang,Xudong Zhang,Jincheng Wang,Jincheng Wang,Baoqiang Wu,Baoqiang Wu,Tao Li,Tao Li,Lei Jin,Lei Jin,Yong Wu,Yong Wu,Peng Gao,Peng Gao,Zhen Zhang,Zhen Zhang,Xihu Qin,Xihu Qin,Chunfu Zhu,Chunfu Zhu",Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology,2022.0

All patients underwent baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans and clinical follow-up within three-year time. Clinical risk factors and MRI-based features were extracted and analyzed. The radiomic signatures were built using the radiomics-score (Rad-score) that calculated for each patient as a linear weighted combination of selected MRI-based features. Prognostic performances of the clinical and radiomic nomograms were evaluated with Cox modeling in the training and validation cohorts.Eighteen features were selected for inclusion in the Rad-score prognostic model.

10.1038/s41598-022-08301-1,35304508.0,,Assessing radiomics feature stability with simulated CT acquisitions.,"Medical imaging quantitative features had once disputable usefulness in clinical studies. Nowadays, advancements in analysis techniques, for instance through machine learning, have enabled quantitative features to be progressively useful in diagnosis and research. Tissue characterisation is improved via the ""radiomics"" features, whose extraction can be automated. Despite the advances, stability of quantitative features remains an important open problem. As features can be highly sensitive to variations of acquisition details, it is not trivial to quantify stability and efficiently select stable features. In this work, we develop and validate a Computed Tomography (CT) simulator environment based on the publicly available ASTRA toolbox ( www.astra-toolbox.com ). We show that the variability, stability and discriminative power of the radiomics features extracted from the virtual phantom images generated by the simulator are similar to those observed in a tandem phantom study. Additionally, we show that the variability is matched between a multi-center phantom study and simulated results.

10.3390/jpm12040553,,,CT Reconstruction Kernels and the Effect of Pre- and Post-Processing on the Reproducibility of Handcrafted Radiomic Features,"Handcrafted radiomics features (HRFs) are quantitative features extracted from medical images to decode biological information to improve clinical decision making. Despite the potential of the field, limitations have been identified. The most important identified limitation, currently, is the sensitivity of HRF to variations in image acquisition and reconstruction parameters. In this study, we investigated the use of Reconstruction Kernel Normalization (RKN) and ComBat harmonization to improve the reproducibility of HRFs across scans acquired with different reconstruction kernels. A set of phantom scans (n = 28) acquired on five different scanner models was analyzed. HRFs were extracted from the original scans, and scans were harmonized using the RKN method. ComBat harmonization was applied on both sets of HRFs. The reproducibility of HRFs was assessed using the concordance correlation coefficient. The difference in the number of reproducible HRFs in each scenario was assessed using McNemar’s test. The majority of HRFs were found to be sensitive to variations in the reconstruction kernels, and only six HRFs were found to be robust with respect to variations in reconstruction kernels. The use of RKN resulted in a significant increment in the number of reproducible HRFs in 19 out of the 67 investigated scenarios (28.4%), while the ComBat technique resulted in a significant increment in 36 (53.7%) scenarios. The combination of methods resulted in a significant increment in 53 (79.1%) scenarios compared to the HRFs extracted from original images. Since the benefit of applying the harmonization methods depended on the data being harmonized, reproducibility analysis is recommended before performing radiomics analysis. For future radiomics studies incorporating images acquired with similar image acquisition and reconstruction parameters, except for the reconstruction kernels, we recommend the systematic use of the pre- and post-processing approaches (respectively, RKN and ComBat).","Turkey Refaee,Turkey Refaee,Zohaib Salahuddin,Zohaib Salahuddin,Yousif Widaatalla,Yousif Widaatalla,Sergey Primakov,Sergey Primakov,Henry C.

Radiomics features can be extracted from the lesions and used to train Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict between tumour and liver tissue. The purpose of this study was to investigate and classify Radiomics features extracted from liver tumours and normal liver tissue in a limited CT dataset.The Liver Tumour Segmentation Benchmark (LiTS) dataset consisting of 131 CT scans of the liver with segmentations of tumour tissue and healthy liver was used to extract Radiomic features. Extracted Radiomic features included size, shape, and location extracted with morphological and statistical techniques according to the International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging manual. Relevant features was selected with chi2 correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) with tumour and healthy liver tissue as outcome according to a consensus between three experienced radiologists. Logistic regression, random forest and support vector machine was used to train and validate the dataset with a 10-fold cross-validation method and the Grid Search as hyper-parameter tuning. Performance was evaluated with sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.The performance of the ML algorithms achieved sensitivities, specificities and accuracy ranging from 96.30% (95% CI: 81.03%-99.91%) to 100.00% (95% CI: 86.77%-100.00%), 91.30% (95% CI: 71.96%-98.93%) to 100.00% (95% CI: 83.89%-100.00%)and 94.00% (95% CI: 83.45%-98.75%) to 100.00% (95% CI: 92.45%-100.00%), respectively.ML algorithms classifies Radiomics features extracted from healthy liver and tumour tissue with perfect accuracy. The Radiomics signature allows for a prognostic biomarker for hepatic tumour screening on liver CT.Differentiation between tumour and liver tissue with Radiomics ML algorithms have the potential to increase the diagnostic accuracy, assist in the decision-making of supplementary multiphasic enhanced medical imaging, as well as for developing novel prognostic biomarkers for liver cancer patients.","Simon Lysdahlgaard,S Lysdahlgaard",Radiography,2022.0
10.3233/jad-215452,,,Cross-Cultural Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline (CLoCODE) for Subjective Cognitive Decline in China and Germany: A Protocol for Study Design,"Background: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is considered as the first symptomatic manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is also affected by different cultural backgrounds. Establishing cross-cultural prediction models of SCD is challenging. Objective: To establish prediction models of SCD available for both the Chinese and European populations. Methods: In this project, 330 SCD from China and 380 SCD from Germany are intended to be recruited. For all participants, standardized assessments, including clinical, neuropsychological, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, blood, and multi-parameter magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline will be conducted. Participants will voluntarily undergo amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and are classified into amyloid-β (Aβ) positive SCD (SCD+) and Aβ negative SCD (SCD-). First, baseline data of all SCD individuals between the two cohorts will be compared. Then, key features associated with brain amyloidosis will be extracted in SCD+ individuals, and the diagnosis model will be established using the radiomics method. Finally, the follow-up visits will be conducted every 12 months and the primary outcome is the conversion to mild cognitive impairment or dementia. After a 4-year follow-up, we will extract factors associated with the conversion risk of SCD using Cox regression analysis. Results: At present, 141 SCD from China and 338 SCD from Germany have been recruited. Initial analysis showed significant differences in demographic information, neuropsychological tests, and regional brain atrophy in SCD compared with controls in both cohorts. Conclusion: This project may be of great value for future implications of SCD studies in different cultural backgrounds. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04696315.

10.3390/cancers14082008,,,Deep Neural Networks and Machine Learning Radiomics Modelling for Prediction of Relapse in Mantle Cell Lymphoma,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare lymphoid malignancy with a poor prognosis characterised by frequent relapse and short durations of treatment response. Most patients present with aggressive disease, but there exist indolent subtypes without the need for immediate intervention. The very heterogeneous behaviour of MCL is genetically characterised by the translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32), leading to Cyclin D1 overexpression with distinct clinical and biological characteristics and outcomes. There is still an unfulfilled need for precise MCL prognostication in real-time. Machine learning and deep learning neural networks are rapidly advancing technologies with promising results in numerous fields of application. This study develops and compares the performance of deep learning (DL) algorithms and radiomics-based machine learning (ML) models to predict MCL relapse on baseline CT scans. Five classification algorithms were used, including three deep learning models (3D SEResNet50, 3D DenseNet, and an optimised 3D CNN) and two machine learning models based on K-nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF). The best performing method, our optimised 3D CNN, predicted MCL relapse with a 70% accuracy, better than the 3D SEResNet50 (62%) and the 3D DenseNet (59%). The second-best performing method was the KNN-based machine learning model (64%) after principal component analysis for improved accuracy. Our optimised CNN developed by ourselves correctly predicted MCL relapse in 70% of the patients on baseline CT imaging. Once prospectively tested in clinical trials with a larger sample size, our proposed 3D deep learning model could facilitate clinical management by precision imaging in MCL.","Catharina Silvia Lisson,Catharina Lisson,Christoph Lisson,Christoph Lisson,Maja Mezger,Marc Mezger,Daniel Wolf,Daniel Wolf,Stefan A.

Radiomics features (110 features classified into 7 groups) were extracted from all segmented lymph nodes. Analysis was performed on PET, CT, and combined PET/CT inputs. Lymph nodes were randomly assigned to a training (n = 132) and validation cohort (n = 33) by 5-fold cross-validation. K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and random forest (RF) machine learning models were used. Performance was evaluated using an area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) score.Axillary lymph nodes from breast cancer patients (n = 85) and COVID-19-vaccinated individuals (n = 80) were analyzed. Analysis of first-order features showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in all combined PET/CT features, most PET features, and half of the CT features.

The medical records of consecutive patients who were newly diagnosed with primary breast IDC after curative surgery were reviewed. Patients who received any neoadjuvant treatment before surgery were not included. FDG PET/CT radiomic features, such as a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), skewness, kurtosis, entropy, and uniformity, were measured for the primary breast tumor using LIFEx software to evaluate recurrence-free survival (RFS). A total of 124 patients with early breast IDC were evaluated. Eleven patients had a recurrence (8.9%). Univariate survival analysis identified large tumor size (&gt;2 cm, p = 0.045), high Ki-67 expression (≥30%, p = 0.017), high AJCC prognostic stage (≥II, p = 0.044), high SUVmax (≥5.0, p = 0.002), high MTV (≥3.25 mL, p = 0.044), high TLG (≥10.5, p = 0.004), and high entropy (≥3.15, p = 0.003) as significant predictors of poor RFS. After multivariate survival analysis, only high MTV (p = 0.045) was an independent prognostic predictor.

The development of therapies targeting molecular alterations has significantly improved the treatment of NSCLC patients. To identify these targets, tumor phenotyping is required, with tissue biopsies and molecular pathology being the gold standard. Some patients do not respond to targeted therapies and many patients suffer from tumor recurrence, which can in part be explained by tumor heterogeneity. This points out the need for new biomarkers allowing for better tumor phenotyping and monitoring during treatment to assess patient outcome. The contents of this review are based on a literature search conducted using the PubMed database in March 2021 and the authors' experience. The use of radiomics and artificial intelligence-based approaches allows for the identification of imaging biomarkers in NSCLC patients for tumor phenotyping. Several studies show promising results for models predicting molecular alterations, with the best results being achieved by combining structural and functional imaging. Radiomics could help solve the pressing clinical need for assessing and predicting therapy response. To reach this goal, advanced tumor phenotyping, considering tumor heterogeneity, is required. This could be achieved by integrating structural and functional imaging biomarkers with clinical data sources, such as liquid biopsy results. However, to allow for radiomics-based approaches to be introduced into clinical practice, further standardization using large, multi-center datasets is required. · Some NSCLC patients do not benefit from targeted therapies, and many patients suffer from tumor recurrence, pointing out the need for new biomarkers allowing for better tumor phenotyping and monitoring during treatment.. · The use of radiomics-based approaches allows for the identification of imaging biomarkers in NSCLC patients for tumor phenotyping.. · A multi-omics approach integrating not only structural and functional imaging biomarkers but also clinical data sources, such as liquid biopsy results, could further enhance the prediction and assessment of therapy response..· Kroschke J, von Stackelberg O, Heußel CP et al.

However, studies revealed that up to 67%–78% of BI-RADS 4 lesions proved to be benign, but received unnecessary biopsies, which may cause unnecessary anxiety and discomfort to patients and increase the burden on the healthcare system. In this prospective study, machine learning (ML) based on the emerging breast ultrasound technology-automated breast volume scanner (ABVS) was constructed to distinguish benign and malignant BI-RADS 4 lesions and compared with different experienced radiologists. A total of 223 pathologically confirmed BI-RADS 4 lesions were recruited and divided into training and testing cohorts. Radiomics features were extracted from axial, sagittal, and coronal ABVS images for each lesion. Seven feature selection methods and 13 ML algorithms were used to construct different ML pipelines, of which the DNN-RFE (combination of recursive feature elimination and deep neural networks) had the best performance in both training and testing cohorts. The AUC value of the DNN-RFE was significantly higher than less experienced radiologist at Delong's test (0.954 vs. 0.776, p = 0.004). Additionally, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the DNN-RFE were 88.9%, 83.3%, 95.2%, 83.3%, and 95.2%, which also significantly better than less experienced radiologist at McNemar's test (p = 0.043).

In the present study, a structural neuroimaging analysis based on radiomics and machine learning models is presented with the aim of identifying the brain areas that better predict children’s performance in a variety of mathematical tests. A sample of 77 school-aged children from third to sixth grade were administered four mathematical tests: Math fluency, Calculation, Applied problems and Quantitative concepts as well as a structural brain imaging scan. By extracting radiomics related to the shape, intensity, and texture of specific brain areas, we observed that areas from the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes, basal ganglia, and limbic system, were differentially related to children’s performance in the mathematical tests. sMRI-based analyses in the context of mathematical performance have been mainly focused on volumetric measures. However, the results for radiomics-based analysis showed that for these areas, texture features were the most important for the regression models, while volume accounted for less than 15% of the shape importance. These findings highlight the potential of radiomics for more in-depth analysis of medical images for the identification of brain areas related to mathematical abilities.","Violeta Pina,Víctor M.

NAC also allows for in-vivo testing of the tumors' response to chemotherapy and provides important prognostic information. There are currently no clearly defined clinical models that incorporate imaging with clinical data to predict response to NAC. Thus, the aim of this work is to develop a predictive AI model based on routine CT imaging and clinical parameters to predict response to NAC.The CT scans of 324 patients with NAC from multiple centers in Singapore were used in this study. Four different radiomics models were built for predicting pathological complete response (pCR): first two were based on textural features extracted from peri-tumoral and tumoral regions, the third model based on novel space-resolved radiomics which extract feature maps using voxel-based radiomics and the fourth model based on deep learning (DL). Clinical parameters were included to build a final prognostic model.The best performing models were based on space-resolved and DL approaches. Space-resolved radiomics improves the clinical AUCs of pCR prediction from 0.743 (0.650 to 0.831) to 0.775 (0.685 to 0.860) and our DL model improved it from 0.743 (0.650 to 0.831) to 0.772 (0.685 to 0.853). The tumoral radiomics model performs the worst with no improvement of the AUC from the clinical model. The peri-tumoral combined model gives moderate performance with an AUC of 0.765 (0.671 to 0.855).Radiomics features extracted from diagnostic CT augment the predictive ability of pCR when combined with clinical features. The novel space-resolved radiomics and DL radiomics approaches outperformed conventional radiomics techniques.","Tan Hong Qi,Tan Hong Qi,Ong Hiok Hian,Ong Hiok Hian,Arjunan Kumaran,Arjunan Muthu Kumaran,Tira J.

10.3389/fonc.2022.796583,,,Multiparametric MRI-Based Radiomics Model for Predicting H3 K27M Mutant Status in Diffuse Midline Glioma: A Comparative Study Across Different Sequences and Machine Learning Techniques,"Objectives The performance of multiparametric MRI-based radiomics models for predicting H3 K27M mutant status in diffuse midline glioma (DMG) has not been thoroughly evaluated. The optimal combination of multiparametric MRI and machine learning techniques remains undetermined. We compared the performance of various radiomics models across different MRI sequences and different machine learning techniques. Methods A total of 102 patients with pathologically confirmed DMG were retrospectively enrolled (27 with H3 K27M-mutant and 75 with H3 K27M wild-type). Radiomics features were extracted from eight sequences, and 18 feature sets were conducted by independent combination. There were three feature matrix normalization algorithms, two dimensionality-reduction methods, four feature selectors, and seven classifiers, consisting of 168 machine learning pipelines. Radiomics models were established across different feature sets and machine learning pipelines. The performance of models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves with area under the curve (AUC) and compared with DeLong’s test. Results The multiparametric MRI-based radiomics models could accurately predict the H3 K27M mutant status in DMG (highest AUC: 0.807–0.969, for different sequences or sequence combinations). However, the results varied significantly between different machine learning techniques. When suitable machine learning techniques were used, the conventional MRI-based radiomics models shared similar performance to advanced MRI-based models (highest AUC: 0.875–0.915 vs. 0.807–0.926; DeLong’s test, p &amp;gt; 0.05). Most models had a better performance when generated with a combination of MRI sequences. The optimal model in the present study used a combination of all sequences (AUC = 0.969). Conclusions The multiparametric MRI-based radiomics models could be useful for predicting H3 K27M mutant status in DMG, but the performance varied across different sequences and machine learning techniques.","Wei Guo,Wei Guo,Dejun She,Dejun She,Xing Zhou,Zhen Xing,Xiang Lin,Xiang Lin,Feng Wang,Feng Wang,Yang Song,Yang Song,Dairong Cao,Dairong Cao",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0
10.1177/02841851221080830,35354318.0,,Multiparametric MRI-based radiomics for the prediction of microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Preoperative prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is essential in obtaining a successful surgical treatment, in decreasing recurrence, and in improving survival.To investigate the value of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics in the prediction of peritumoral MVI in HCC.A total of 102 patient with pathologically proven HCC after surgical resection from June 2014 to March 2018 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Histological analysis of resected specimens confirmed positive MVI in 48 patients and negative MVI in 54 patients. Radiomics features were extracted from four MRI sequences and selected with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and used to analyze the tumoral and peritumoral regions for MVI. Univariate logistic regression was employed to identify the most important clinical factors, which were integrated with the radiomics signature to develop a nomogram.In total, 11 radiomics features were selected and used to build the radiomics signature. The serum level of alpha-fetoprotein was identified as the clinical factor with the highest predictive value. The developed nomogram achieved the highest AUC in predicting MVI status. The decision curve analysis confirmed the potential clinical utility of the proposed nomogram.The multiparametric MRI-based radiomics nomogram is a promising tool for the preoperative diagnosis of peritumoral MVI in HCCs and helps determine the appropriate medical or surgical therapy.","Tao Jiang,Tao Jiang,Shuai He,Shuai He,Huazhe Yang,Haw Yang,Yue Dong,Yue Dong,Tao Yu,Tao Yu,Yahong Luo,Yahong Luo,Xiran Jiang,Xiran Jiang",Acta Radiologica,2022.0
10.1007/s00330-022-08625-6,,,Multiparametric MRI-based radiomics model to predict pelvic lymph node invasion for patients with prostate cancer,"ObjectiveTo identify which patient with prostate cancer (PCa) could safely avoid extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) by predicting lymph node invasion (LNI), via a radiomics-based machine learning approach.MethodsAn integrative radiomics model (IRM) was proposed to predict LNI, confirmed by the histopathologic examination, integrating radiomics features, extracted from prostatic index lesion regions on MRI images, and clinical features via SVM. The study cohort comprised 244 PCa patients with MRI and followed by radical prostatectomy (RP) and ePLND within 6 months between 2010 and 2019. The proposed IRM was trained in training/validation set and evaluated in an internal independent testing set. The model’s performance was measured by area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV). AUCs were compared via Delong test with 95% confidence interval (CI), and the rest measurements were compared via chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test.ResultsOverall, 17 (10.6%) and 14 (16.7%) patients with LNI were included in training/validation set and testing set, respectively. Shape and first-order radiomics features showed usefulness in building the IRM. The proposed IRM achieved an AUC of 0.915 (95% CI: 0.846–0.984) in the testing set, superior to pre-existing nomograms whose AUCs were from 0.698 to 0.724 (p < 0.05).ConclusionThe proposed IRM could be potentially feasible to predict the risk of having LNI for patients with PCa. With the improved predictability, it could be utilized to assess which patients with PCa could safely avoid ePLND, thus reduce the number of unnecessary ePLND.Key Points• The combination of MRI-based radiomics features with clinical information improved the prediction of lymph node invasion, compared with the model using only radiomics features or clinical features.• With improved prediction performance on predicting lymph node invasion, the number of extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) could be reduced by the proposed integrative radiomics model (IRM), compared with the existing nomograms.","Haoxin Zheng,Haoxin Zheng,Qi Miao,Qi Miao,Yongkai Liu,Yongkai Liu,Sohrab Afshari Mirak,Sohrab Afshari Mirak,Melina Hosseiny,Melina Hosseiny,Fabien Scalzo,Fabien Scalzo,Steven S.

10.3390/cancers14051228,,,Multitask Learning Radiomics on Longitudinal Imaging to Predict Survival Outcomes following Risk-Adaptive Chemoradiation for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"(1) Background: Medical imaging provides quantitative and spatial information to evaluate treatment response in the management of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). High throughput extraction of radiomic features on these images can potentially phenotype tumors non-invasively and support risk stratification based on survival outcome prediction. The prognostic value of radiomics from different imaging modalities and time points prior to and during chemoradiation therapy of NSCLC, relative to conventional imaging biomarker or delta radiomics models, remains uncharacterized. We investigated the utility of multitask learning of multi-time point radiomic features, as opposed to single-task learning, for improving survival outcome prediction relative to conventional clinical imaging feature model benchmarks. (2) Methods: Survival outcomes were prospectively collected for 45 patients with unresectable NSCLC enrolled on the FLARE-RT phase II trial of risk-adaptive chemoradiation and optional consolidation PD-L1 checkpoint blockade (NCT02773238). FDG-PET, CT, and perfusion SPECT imaging pretreatment and week 3 mid-treatment was performed and 110 IBSI-compliant pyradiomics shape-/intensity-/texture-based features from the metabolic tumor volume were extracted. Outcome modeling consisted of a fused Laplacian sparse group LASSO with component-wise gradient boosting survival regression in a multitask learning framework. Testing performance under stratified 10-fold cross-validation was evaluated for multitask learning radiomics of different imaging modalities and time points. Multitask learning models were benchmarked against conventional clinical imaging and delta radiomics models and evaluated with the concordance index (c-index) and index of prediction accuracy (IPA). (3) Results: FDG-PET radiomics had higher prognostic value for overall survival in test folds (c-index 0.71 [0.67, 0.75]) than CT radiomics (c-index 0.64 [0.60, 0.71]) or perfusion SPECT radiomics (c-index 0.60 [0.57, 0.63]). Multitask learning of pre-/mid-treatment FDG-PET radiomics (c-index 0.71 [0.67, 0.75]) outperformed benchmark clinical imaging (c-index 0.65 [0.59, 0.71]) and FDG-PET delta radiomics (c-index 0.52 [0.48, 0.58]) models. Similarly, the IPA for multitask learning FDG-PET radiomics (30%) was higher than clinical imaging (26%) and delta radiomics (15%) models. Radiomics models performed consistently under different voxel resampling conditions. (4) Conclusion: Multitask learning radiomics for outcome modeling provides a clinical decision support platform that leverages longitudinal imaging information. This framework can reveal the relative importance of different imaging modalities and time points when designing risk-adaptive cancer treatment strategies.","Parisa Forouzannezhad,Parisa Forouzannezhad,Dominic Maes,Dominic Maes,Daniel S.

10.1136/jitc-2021-003778,,,Novel imaging biomarkers predict outcomes in stage III unresectable non-small cell lung cancer treated with chemoradiation and durvalumab,"Background The landmark study of durvalumab as consolidation therapy in NSCLC patients (PACIFIC trial) demonstrated significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with durvalumab (immunotherapy, IO) therapy after chemoradiotherapy (CRT). In clinical practice in the USA, durvalumab continues to be used in patients across all levels of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression. While immune therapies have shown promise in several cancers, some patients either do not respond to the therapy or have cancer recurrence after an initial response. It is not clear so far who will benefit of this therapy or what the mechanisms behind treatment failure are. Methods A total of 133 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC who underwent durvalumab after CRT or CRT alone were included. Patients treated with durvalumab IO after CRT were randomly split into training (D1=59) and test (D2=59) sets and the remaining 15 patients treated with CRT alone were grouped in D3. Radiomic textural patterns from within and around the target nodules were extracted. A radiomic risk score (RRS) was built and was used to predict PFS and overall survival (OS). Patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on median RRS. Results RRS was found to be significantly associated with PFS in D1 (HR=2.67, 95% CI 1.85 to 4.13, p&lt;0.05, C-index=0.78) and D2 (HR=2.56, 95% CI 1.63 to 4, p&lt;0.05, C-index=0.73). Similarly, RRS was associated with OS in D1 (HR=1.89, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.75, p&lt;0.05, C-index=0.67) and D2 (HR=2.14, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.6, p&lt;0.05, C-index=0.69), respectively. RRS was found to be significantly associated with PFS in high PD-L1 (HR=3.01, 95% CI 1.41 to 6.45, p=0.0044) and low PD-L1 (HR=2.74, 95% CI 1.8 to 4.14, p=1.77e-06) groups. Moreover, RRS was not significantly associated with OS in the high PD-L1 group (HR=2.08, 95% CI 0.98 to 4.4, p=0.054) but was significantly associated with OS in the low PD-L1 group (HR=1.61, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.28, p=0.0062). In addition, RRS was significantly associated with PFS (HR=2.77, 95% CI 1.17 to 6.52, p=0.019, C-index=0.77) and OS (HR=2.62, 95% CI 1.25 to 5.51, p=0.01, C-index=0.77) in D3, respectively. Conclusions Tumor radiomics of pretreatment CT images from patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC were prognostic of PFS and OS to CRT followed by durvalumab IO and CRT alone.","Khalid Jazieh,Khalid Jazieh,Khalid Jazieh,Mohammadhadi Khorrami,Mohammadhadi Khorrami,Mohammadhadi Khorrami,Anas Saad,Anas Saad,Anas M.

Preoperative clinical factors, serum tumor markers, and PET/CT radiomic features were included for the recurrence-free survival analysis. For the modeling and validation, patients were randomly divided into the training (n = 137) and validation (n = 59) set, while the 78 stage III patients [training (n = 55), and validation (n = 23)] was divided for the further experiment. After selecting features by the log-rank test and variable-hunting methods, random survival forest (RSF) models were built on the training set to analyze the prognostic value of selected features. The performance of models was measured by C-index and was tested on the validation set with bootstrapping. Feature importance and the Pearson correlation were also analyzed.Radiomics signature (containing four PET/CT features and four clinical factors) achieved the best result for prognostic prediction of 196 patients (C-index 0.780, 95% CI 0.634-0.877). Moreover, four features (including two clinical features and two radiomics features) were selected for prognostic prediction of the 78 stage III patients (C-index was 0.820, 95% CI 0.676-0.900). K-M curves of both models significantly stratified low-risk and high-risk groups (P < 0.0001). Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated that selected radiomics features were correlated with tumor metabolic factors, such as SUVmean, SUVmax.This study presents integrated clinico-biological-radiological models that can accurately predict the prognosis in colorectal cancer using the preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics in colorectal cancer.

We aimed to evaluate the current status and quality of radiomic research as well as its potential for identifying biomarkers to predict therapy response and prognosis in patients with GC.MethodsWe performed a systematic search of the PubMed and Embase databases for articles published from inception through July 10, 2021. The phase classification criteria for image mining studies and the radiomics quality scoring (RQS) tool were applied to evaluate scientific and reporting quality.ResultsTwenty-five studies consisting of 10,432 patients were included. 96% of studies extracted radiomic features from CT images. Association between radiomic signature and therapy response was evaluated in seven (28%) studies; association with survival was evaluated in 17 (68%) studies; one (4%) study analyzed both. All results of the included studies showed significant associations. Based on the phase classification criteria for image mining studies, 18 (72%) studies were classified as phase II, with two, four, and one studies as discovery science, phase 0 and phase I, respectively. The median RQS score for the radiomic studies was 44.4% (range, 0 to 55.6%). There was extensive heterogeneity in the study population, tumor stage, treatment protocol, and radiomic workflow amongst the studies.ConclusionsAlthough radiomic research in GC is highly heterogeneous and of relatively low quality, it holds promise for predicting therapy response and prognosis.

Methods Scan-rescans of three-dimensional MRF and conventional T1-weighted imaging were performed on 21 healthy volunteers (9 males and 12 females; mean age, 41.3 ± 14.6 years; age range, 22–72 years). Five patients with multiple sclerosis (3 males and 2 females; mean age, 41.2 ± 7.3 years; age range, 32–53 years) were also included. MRF data were reconstructed using various dictionaries with different step sizes. First- and second-order radiomic features were extracted from each dataset. Intra-dictionary repeatability and inter-dictionary reproducibility were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Features with ICCs &gt; 0.90 were considered acceptable. Relative changes were calculated to assess inter-dictionary biases. Results The overall scan-rescan ICCs of MRF-based radiomics ranged from 0.86 to 0.95, depending on dictionary step size. No significant differences were observed in the overall scan-rescan repeatability of MRF-based radiomic features and conventional T1-weighted imaging ( p = 1.00). Intra-dictionary repeatability was insensitive to dictionary step size differences. MRF-based radiomic features varied among dictionaries (overall ICC for inter-dictionary reproducibility, 0.62–0.99), especially when step sizes were large. First-order and gray level co-occurrence matrix features were the most reproducible feature classes among different step size dictionaries. T1 map-derived radiomic features provided higher repeatability and reproducibility among dictionaries than those obtained with T2 maps.

10.3390/cancers14071778,,,"Radiomics-Based Method for Predicting the Glioma Subtype as Defined by Tumor Grade, IDH Mutation, and 1p/19q Codeletion","Gliomas are among the most common types of central nervous system (CNS) tumors. A prompt diagnosis of the glioma subtype is crucial to estimate the prognosis and personalize the treatment strategy. The objective of this study was to develop a radiomics pipeline based on the clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to noninvasively predict the glioma subtype, as defined based on the tumor grade, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status, and 1p/19q codeletion status. A total of 212 patients from the public retrospective The Cancer Genome Atlas Low Grade Glioma (TCGA-LGG) and The Cancer Genome Atlas Glioblastoma Multiforme (TCGA-GBM) datasets were used for the experiments and analyses. Different settings in the radiomics pipeline were investigated to improve the classification, including the Z-score normalization, the feature extraction strategy, the image filter applied to the MRI images, the introduction of clinical information, ComBat harmonization, the classifier chain strategy, etc. Based on numerous experiments, we finally reached an optimal pipeline for classifying the glioma tumors. We then tested this final radiomics pipeline on the hold-out test data with 51 randomly sampled random seeds for reliable and robust conclusions. The results showed that, after tuning the radiomics pipeline, the mean AUC improved from 0.8935 (±0.0351) to 0.9319 (±0.0386), from 0.8676 (±0.0421) to 0.9283 (±0.0333), and from 0.6473 (±0.1074) to 0.8196 (±0.0702) in the test data for predicting the tumor grade, IDH mutation, and 1p/19q codeletion status, respectively. The mean accuracy for predicting the five glioma subtypes also improved from 0.5772 (±0.0816) to 0.6716 (±0.0655). Finally, we analyzed the characteristics of the radiomic features that best distinguished the glioma grade, the IDH mutation, and the 1p/19q codeletion status, respectively. Apart from the promising prediction of the glioma subtype, this study also provides a better understanding of the radiomics model development and interpretability. The results in this paper are replicable with our python codes publicly available in github.","Yingping Li,Yingping Li,Samy Ammari,Samy Ammari,Littisha Lawrance,Littisha Lawrance,Arnaud Quillent,Arnaud Quillent,Tarek Assi,Tarek Assi,Nathalie Lassau,Nathalie Lassau,Émilie Chouzenoux,Emilie Chouzenoux",Cancers,2022.0

Radiomics features were extracted from pre-treatment 1.5 T T2w MR images. The predictive performance of each feature was quantified in terms of Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Among the significant features, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was calculated to quantify the correlation among the different predictors. A logistic regression model was calculated considering the two most significant features at the univariate analysis showing the lowest PCC value. The predictive performance of the model created was quantified out using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).A total of 175 patients were retrospectively enrolled (142 for the training cohort and 33 for the validation one). 1896 radiomic feature were extracted, 91 of which showed significance (p < 0.05) at the univariate analysis. The radiomic model showing the highest predictive value combined the features calculated starting from the gray level co-occurrence-based features. This model achieved an AUC of 0.73 in the training set and 0.91 in the validation set.The proposed radiomic model showed promising performances in predicting 2-year overall survival before NACRT. Nevertheless, the observed results should be tested in larger studies with consistent external validation cohorts, to confirm their potential clinical use.","Riccardo Autorino,Rosa Autorino,Benedetta Gui,Benedetta Gui,Giulia Panza,Giulia Panza,Luca Boldrini,Luca Boldrini,Davide Cusumano,D.

It helps to reduce the features variability so as to improve the reporting quality of radiomics study. In this research, we aimed to conduct a radiomic feature reproducibility test of inter-/intra-observer delineation variability in hepatocellular carcinoma using 3D-CT images, 4D-CT images and multiple-parameter MR images. Materials and Methods For this retrospective study, 19 HCC patients undergoing 3D-CT, 4D-CT and multiple-parameter MR scans were included in this study. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was independently delineated twice by two observers based on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), maximum intensity projection (MIP), LAVA-Flex, T2W FRFSE and DWI-EPI images. We also delineated the peritumoral region, which was defined as 0 to 5 mm radius surrounding the GTV. 107 radiomic features were automatically extracted from CECT images using 3D-Slicer software. Quartile coefficient of dispersion (QCD) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were applied to assess the variability of each radiomic feature. QCD&amp;lt;10% and ICC≥0.75 were considered small variations and excellent reliability. Finally, the principal component analysis (PCA) was used to test the feasibility of dimensionality reduction. Results For tumor tissues, the numbers of radiomic features with QCD&amp;lt;10% indicated no obvious inter-/intra-observer differences or discrepancies in 3D-CT, 4D-CT and multiple-parameter MR delineation. However, the number of radiomic features (mean 89) with ICC≥0.75 was the highest in the multiple-parameter MR group, followed by the 3DCT group (mean 77) and the MIP group (mean 73). The peritumor tissues also showed similar results. A total of 15 and 7 radiomic features presented excellent reproducibility and small variation in tumor and peritumoral tissues, respectively. Two robust features showed excellent reproducibility and small variation in tumor and peritumoral tissues. In addition, the values of the two features both represented statistically significant differences among tumor and peritumoral tissues ( P &amp;lt;0.05). The PCA results indicated that the first seven principal components could preserve at least 90% of the variance of the original set of features. Conclusion Delineation on multiple-parameter MR images could help to improve the reproducibility of the HCC CT radiomic features and weaken the inter-/intra-observer influence.","Jinghao Duan,Jinghao Duan,Qingtao Qiu,Jian Zhu,Qingtao Qiu,Dan Shang,Jian Zhu,Di Xue,Dongping Shang,Tao Sun,Xue Dou,Tao Sun,Yong Yin,Xiangwen Meng,Yong Yin,Xiangjuan Meng",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0

Reproducibility of radiomics features from US images, also known as ultrasomics features, was explored via (a) intra-US machine: changing the US acquisition parameters including gain, focus, and frequency; (b) inter-US machine: comparing three different scanners; (c) changing segmentation locations; and (d) inter-platform: comparing features extracted by the Ultrasomics and PyRadiomics algorithm platforms. Reproducible ultrasomics features were selected based on coefficients of variation.ResultsA total of 108 US images from three scanners were obtained; 5253 ultrasomics features including seven categories of features were extracted and evaluated for each US image. From intra-US machine analysis, 37.0–38.8% of features showed good reproducibility. From inter-US machine analysis, 42.8% (2248/5253) of features exhibited good reproducibility. From segmentation location analysis, 55.7–57.6% of features showed good reproducibility. No significant difference in the normalized feature ranges was found between the 100 features extracted by the Ultrasomics and PyRadiomics platforms with the same algorithm (p = 0.563). A total of 1452 (27.6%) ultrasomics features were reproducible whenever intra-/inter-US machine or segmentation location were changed, most of which were wavelet and shearlet features.ConclusionsDifferent acquisition parameters, US scanners, segmentation locations, and feature extraction platforms affected the reproducibility of ultrasomics features.

To simulate motion, a special motor was manufactured to simulate respiratory motion based on a normal patient in two directions. The lesions were delineated semi-automatically to extract 174 radiomic features. All radiomic features were categorized according to the coefficient of variation (COV) to select robust features. A cohort consisting of 40 NSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma (n = 20) and squamous cell carcinoma (n = 20) was retrospectively analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed to discriminate robust features in differentiating histopathology subtypes of NSCLC lesions.Overall, 29% of radiomic features showed a COV ≤5% against motion. Forty-five percent and 76% of the features showed a COV ≤ 5% against the test-retest with and without motion in large lesions, respectively. Thirty-three percent and 45% of the features showed a COV ≤ 5% against different reconstruction parameters with and without motion, respectively. For NSCLC histopathological subtype differentiation, statistical analysis showed that 31 features were significant (p-value < 0.05). Two out of the 31 significant features, namely, the joint entropy of GLCM (AUC = 0.71, COV = 0.019) and median absolute deviation of intensity histogram (AUC = 0.7, COV = 0.046), were robust against the motion (same reconstruction setting).Motion, acquisition, and reconstruction parameters significantly impact radiomic features, just as their synergies. Radiomic features with high predictive performance (statistically significant) in differentiating histopathological subtype of NSCLC may be eliminated due to non-reproducibility.","Seyyed Ali Hosseini,Seyyed Ali Hosseini,Isaac Shiri,Isaac Shiri,Ghasem Hajianfar,Ghasem Hajianfar,Bahador Bahadorzade,Bahador Bahadorzade,Pardis Ghafarian,Pardis Ghafarian,Habib Zaidi,Habib Zaidi,Mohammad Reza Ay,Mohammad Reza Ay",Medical Physics,2022.0

Methods: This retrospective study included 79 TET [27 low-risk thymomas (types A, AB and B1), 31 high-risk thymomas (types B2 and B3) and 21 thymic carcinomas] patients who underwent pre-therapeutic 18 F-FDG-PET/CT. High-risk TETs (high-risk thymomas and thymic carcinomas) were 52 patients. The 107 PET-based radiomic features, including SUV-related parameters [maximum SUV (SUV max ), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG)] and 1024 deep-learning features extracted from the convolutional neural network were used to predict the pathological risk subtypes of TETs using six different machine-learning algorithms. The AUCs were calculated to compare the predictive performances. Results: SUV-related parameters yielded the following AUCs for predicting thymic carcinomas: SUVmax 0.713, MTV 0.442, and TLG 0.479 or high-risk TETs: SUVmax 0.673, MTV 0.533, and TLG 0.539. The best-performing algorithm was the logistic regression model for predicting thymic carcinomas (AUC 0.900, accuracy 81.0%), and the random forest (RF) model for high-risk TETs (AUC 0.744, accuracy 72.2%). The AUC was significantly higher in the logistic regression model than 3 SUV-related parameters for predicting thymic carcinomas, and in the RF model than MTV and TLG for predicting high-risk TETs (each; p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: 18 F-FDG-PET-based radiomic analysis using a machine-learning approach may be useful for predicting the pathological risk subtypes of TETs.

In last years, several articles have been published investigating the possible role of radiomics in distinguishing HPV-positive from HPV-negative neoplasms. Aim of this review was to perform a systematic quality assessment of radiomic studies published on this topic. Methods Radiomics studies on HPV status prediction in oropharyngeal cancer patients were selected. The Radiomic Quality Score (RQS) was assessed by three readers to evaluate their methodological quality. In addition, possible correlations between RQS% and journal type, year of publication, impact factor, and journal rank were investigated. Results After the literature search, 19 articles were selected whose RQS median was 33% (range 0–42%). Overall, 16/19 studies included a well-documented imaging protocol, 13/19 demonstrated phenotypic differences, and all were compared with the current gold standard. No study included a public protocol, phantom study, or imaging at multiple time points. More than half (13/19) included feature selection and only 2 were comprehensive of non-radiomic features. Mean RQS was significantly higher in clinical journals. Conclusion Radiomics has been proposed for oropharyngeal cancer HPV status assessment, with promising results. However, these are supported by low methodological quality investigations. Further studies with higher methodological quality, appropriate standardization, and greater attention to validation are necessary prior to clinical adoption.","Gaia Spadarella,Lorenzo Ugga,Gaia Spadarella,Giuseppina Calareso,Lorenzo Ugga,Giuseppina Calareso,Rossella Villa,Rossella Villa,Serena D'Aniello,Serena D'Aniello,Renato Cuocolo,Renato Cuocolo",Neuroradiology,2022.0
10.1007/s00247-022-05322-w,35347371.0,,The role of artificial intelligence in paediatric neuroradiology.,"Imaging plays a fundamental role in the managing childhood neurologic, neurosurgical and neuro-oncological disease. Employing multi-parametric MRI techniques, such as spectroscopy and diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging, to the radiophenotyping of neuroradiologic conditions is becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly with radiogenomic analyses correlating imaging characteristics with molecular biomarkers of disease. However, integration into routine clinical practice remains elusive. With modern multi-parametric MRI now providing additional data beyond anatomy, informing on histology, biology and physiology, such metric-rich information can present as information overload to the treating radiologist and, as such, information relevant to an individual case can become lost. Artificial intelligence techniques are capable of modelling the vast radiologic, biological and clinical datasets that accompany childhood neurologic disease, such that this information can become incorporated in upfront prognostic modelling systems, with artificial intelligence techniques providing a plausible approach to this solution. This review examines machine learning approaches than can be used to underpin such artificial intelligence applications, with exemplars for each machine learning approach from the world literature. Then, within the specific use case of paediatric neuro-oncology, we examine the potential future contribution for such artificial intelligence machine learning techniques to offer solutions for patient care in the form of decision support systems, potentially enabling personalised medicine within this domain of paediatric radiologic practice.","Catherine Pringle,Catherine Pringle,Catherine Pringle,John-Paul Kilday,John-Paul Kilday,Ian Kamaly-Asl,Ian Kamaly-Asl,Stavros Stivaros,Stavros Stivaros",Pediatric Radiology,2022.0

However, its widespread adoption in clinics is hampered by issues related to features stability. In the MRI radiomic workflow, the main factors that affect radiomic features computation can be found in the image acquisition and reconstruction phase, in the image pre-processing steps, and in the segmentation of the Region of Interest (ROI) on which radiomic indices are extracted. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), having shown their potentiality in the medical image processing and analysis field, can be seen as an attractive strategy to partially overcome the issues related to radiomic stability and mitigate their impact. In fact, DNN approaches can be prospectively integrated in the MRI radiomic workflow to improve image quality, obtain accurate and reproducible segmentations and generate standardized images. In this review, DNN methods that can be included in the image processing steps of the radiomic workflow are described and discussed, in the light of a detailed analysis of the literature in the context of MRI radiomic reliability.","Elisa Scalco,Elisa Scalco,Giovanna Rizzo,Giovanna Rizzo,Alfonso Mastropietro,Alfonso Mastropietro",Physics in Medicine and Biology,2022.0

Methods A total of 659 patients with surgically pathologically confirmed lung adenocarcinoma underwent CT examination. All cases were divided into a training cohort (n = 466) and a validation cohort (n = 193). CT features were analyzed by two chest radiologists. CT radiomics features were extracted from CT images. LASSO regression analysis was applied to determine the most useful radiomics features and construct radiomics score (radscore). A nomogram model was developed by combining the optimal clinical and CT features and the radscore. The model performance was evaluated using ROC analysis, calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results A total of 1316 radiomics features were extracted. A radiomics signature model with a selection of the six optimal features was developed to identify patients with or without VPI. There was a significant difference in the radscore between the two groups of patients. Five clinical features were retained and contributed as clinical feature models. The nomogram combining clinical features and radiomics features showed improved accuracy, specificity, positive predictive value, and AUC for predicting VPI, compared to the radiomics model alone (specificity: training cohort: 0.89, validation cohort: 0.88, accuracy: training cohort: 0.84, validation cohort: 0.83, AUC: training cohort: 0.89, validation cohort: 0.89). The calibration curve and decision curve analyses suggested that the nomogram with clinical features is beyond the traditional clinical and radiomics features.

Methods Clinicopathologic and MRI data of 178 patients with solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (≤5 cm) were retrospectively collected from a single medical center between May 2017 and November 2020. Patients were randomly assigned into training and test subsets by a ratio of 7:3. Imaging features were extracted from the segmented tumor volume of interest with 1-cm expansion on arterial phase (AP) and hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images. Different models based on the significant clinical risk factors and/or selected imaging features were established and the predictive performance of the models was evaluated. Results Three radiomics models, the AP_model, the HBP_model, and the AP+HBP_model, were constructed for MVI prediction. Among them, the AP+HBP_model outperformed the other two. When it was combined with a clinical model, consisting of tumor size and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), the combined model (AP+HBP+Clin_model) showed an area under the curve of 0.90 and 0.70 in the training and test subsets, respectively. Its sensitivity and specificity were 0.91 and 0.76 in the training subset and 0.60 and 0.79 in the test subset, respectively.

In case of patients resulted negative at both clinical and instrumental examination, the nodal status is commonly evaluated performing the sentinel lymph-node biopsy, that is a time-consuming and expensive intraoperative procedure for the sentinel lymph-node (SLN) status assessment. The aim of this study was to predict the nodal status of 142 clinically negative breast cancer patients by means of both clinical and radiomic features extracted from primary breast tumor ultrasound images acquired at diagnosis. First, different regions of interest (ROIs) were segmented and a radiomic analysis was performed on each ROI. Then, clinical and radiomic features were evaluated separately developing two different machine learning models based on an SVM classifier. Finally, their predictive power was estimated jointly implementing a soft voting technique. The experimental results showed that the model obtained by combining clinical and radiomic features provided the best performances, achieving an AUC value of 88.6%, an accuracy of 82.1%, a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 78.2%.

Therefore, feature selection methods are used, which aim to remove redundant as well as irrelevant features. Because there are many feature selection algorithms, it is key to understand their performance in the context of radiomics.A total of 29 feature selection algorithms and 10 classifiers were evaluated on 10 publicly available radiomic datasets. Feature selection methods were compared for training times, for the stability of the selected features, and for ranking, which measures the pairwise similarity of the methods. In addition, the predictive performance of the algorithms was measured by utilizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the best-performing classifier.Feature selections differed largely in training times as well as stability and similarity. No single method was able to outperform another one consistently in predictive performance.Our results indicated that simpler methods are more stable than complex ones and do not perform worse in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Analysis of variance, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and minimum redundancy, maximum relevance ensemble appear to be good choices for radiomic studies in terms of predictive performance, as they outperformed most other feature selection methods.","Aydın Demircioğlu,Aydin Demircioğlu",Investigative Radiology,2022.0

For this retrospective study, a radiomics model was developed on the basis of a training dataset of 192 patients (61.9 ± 13.3 years, 90 men) with cardiac masses detected in cardiac CT from January 2010 to September 2019. We constructed three models for discriminating between a cardiac tumor and a thrombus: a radiomics model, a clinical model, which included clinical and conventional CT variables, and a model that combined clinical and radiomics models. In the training dataset, the radiomics model and the combined model yielded significantly higher differentiation performance between cardiac tumors and cardiac thrombi than the clinical model (AUC 0.973 vs 0.870, p < 0.001 and AUC 0.983 vs 0.870, p < 0.001, respectively). In the external validation dataset with 63 patients (59.8 ± 13.2 years, 26 men), the combined model yielded a larger AUC compared to the clinical model (AUC 0.911 vs 0.802, p = 0.037). CT radiomics analysis is effective in differentiating cardiac tumors and thrombi. In conclusion, the combination of clinical, conventional CT, and radiomics features demonstrated an additional benefit in differentiating between cardiac tumor and thrombi compared to clinical data and conventional CT features alone.","Ji Won Lee,Ji Won Lee,Chul Hwan Park,Chul Hwan Park,Dong Jin Im,Dong Jin Im,Kye Ho Lee,Tae Hoon Kim,Kye Ho Lee,Kyunghwa Han,Tae Hoon Kim,Kyunghwa Han,Jin Hur,Jin Hur",Scientific Reports,2022.0

Textural features from PET and CT images were evaluated using LIFEx software (lifexsoft.org). Sarcopenia measurements were done by measuring the Skeletal Muscle Index at L3 level on the CT component. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted to create a model including the radiomic parameters, clinical features, and Skeletal Muscle Index score to predict patients' outcome.In multivariable analysis, we combined clinicopathological parameters including ECOG, surgical T, and N staging along with imaging derived sarcopenia measurements and radiomic features to build a predictor model for relapse-free survival and overall survival. Overall, adding sarcopenic status to the model with clinical features only (likelihood ratio test P = 0.03) and CT feature (P = 0.0037) improved the model fit for overall survival. Similarly, adding sarcopenic status (P = 0.051), CT feature (P = 0.042), and PET feature (P = 0.011) improved the model fit for relapse-free survival.PET and CT radiomics derived from combined PET/CT integrated with clinicopathological parameters and sarcopenia measurement might improve outcome prediction in patients with nonmetastatic esophagogastric adenocarcinoma.","Reut Anconina,Reut Anconina,Claudia Ortega,Ur Metser,Claudia Ortega,Zhihui Amy Liu,Ur Metser,Zhihui Amy Liu,Elena Elimova,Elena Elimova,Michael J.

On 18F-FDG PET/CT images, the anterior mediastinal tumor was segmented. Standardized uptake value (SUV)max, SUVmean, SUVpeak, MTV and total lesion glycolysis of primary mediastinal lesions were calculated. For texture analysis first, second, and higher-order texture features were calculated. Clinical information includes gender, age, myasthenia gravis status; serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase, C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, white blood cell, lymphocyte and platelet counts were included in the analysis.Histopathologic examination was consistent with low risk and high-risk thymoma in 15 cases and 12 cases, respectively. The age and myasthenic syndrome were statistically significant in both groups (P = 0.039 and P = 0.05, respectively). The serum LDH level was also statistically significant in both groups (450.86 ± 487.07 vs. 204.82 ± 59.04; P < 0.001). The highest AUC has been achieved with MLP Classifier (ANN) machine learning method, with a range of 0.830 then the other learning classifiers. Three features were identified to differentiate low- and high-risk thymoma for the machine learning, namely; myasthenia gravis, LDH, SHAPE_Sphericity [only for 3D ROI (nz>1)].This small dataset study has proposed a machine-learning model by MLP Classifier (ANN) analysis on 18F-FDG PET/CT images, which can predict low risk and high-risk thymoma. This study also demonstrated that the combination of clinical data and specific PET/CT-based radiomic features with image variables can predict thymoma risk groups. However, these results should be supported by studies with larger dataset.","Elgin Özkan,Elgin Ozkan,Kaan Orhan,Kaan Orhan,Çiğdem Soydal,Cigdem Soydal,Yusuf Kahya,S.

The patients were randomly divided into a training group and a test group at a ratio of 8:2. The radiomics features were extracted using one-by-one convolution and neural network activation, filtered with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model, and used to construct a discrimination model with PyTorch. Then, the performance of the model was compared with the radiologists’ diagnostic performance. The neural network model was evaluated using the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC), and the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were analysed.ResultsA total of 102 features, comprising five traditional radiomic features and 97 deep learning features, were selected with LASSO and used to construct a discrimination model, which achieved a total accuracy of 87.50%. The AUC value, specificity, and sensitivity were, respectively, 0.92, 92.30%, and 90.00% for metastatic lymph nodes, 0.87, 95.45%, and 83.33% for benign lymphadenopathy, and 0.88, 90.47%, and 85.71% for lymphoma.

However, the lack of reproducibility and interpretability have hampered clinical use. In this study, we aimed at developing and validating an interpretable and simple-to-use US nomogram that is based on quantitative morphometric features for the prediction of breast malignancy.Successive 917 patients with histologically confirmed breast lesions were included in this retrospective multicentric study and assigned to one training cohort and two external validation cohorts. Morphometric features were extracted from grayscale US images. After feature selection and validation of regression assumptions, a dynamic nomogram with a web-based calculator was developed. The performance of the nomogram was assessed with respect to calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness.Through feature selection, three morphometric features were identified as being the most optimal for predicting malignancy, and all regression assumptions of the prediction model were met. Combining all these predictors, the nomogram demonstrated a good discriminative performance in the training cohort and in the two external validation cohorts with AUCs of 0.885, 0.907, and 0.927, respectively. In addition, calibration and decision curves analyses showed good calibration and clinical usefulness.By incorporating US morphometric features, we constructed an interpretable and easy-to-use dynamic nomogram for quantifying the probability of breast malignancy. The developed nomogram has good generalization abilities, which may fit into clinical practice and serve as a potential tool to guide personalized treatment. Our findings show that quantitative morphometric features from different ultrasound machines and systems can be used as imaging surrogate biomarkers for the development of robust and reproducible quantitative ultrasound dynamic models in breast cancer research.","Qingling Zhang,Qinglu Zhang,Qingling Zhang,Qingling Zhang,Qinglu Zhang,Qinglu Zhang,Taixia Liu,Taixia Liu,Tingting Bao,Taixia Liu,Tingting Bao,Tingting Bao,Qingqing Li,Qingqing Li,Qingqing Li,You Yang,You Yang,You Yang",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0

We aimed at developing and validating radiomics signatures to differentiate sarcoidosis from Hodgkin (HL) and diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL) lymphoma. <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively collected 420 patients (169 sarcoidosis, 140 HL and 111 DLBCL) who underwent a pretreatment <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT at the University Hospital of Liege. The studies were randomly distributed to 4 physicians who gave their diagnostic suggestion between the 3 diseases. Individual and pooled performances of physicians were then calculated. The inter-observer variability was evaluated using a sample of 34 studies interpreted by all physicians. Volumes of interest (VOI) were delineated over the lesions and the liver using MIM software, and 215 radiomic features were extracted using Radiomics toolbox. Models were developed combining clinical data (age, gender and weight) and radiomics (original and tumor-to-liver TLR radiomics), with 7 different feature selection approaches and 4 different machine learning (ML) classifiers, to differentiate sarcoidosis and lymphomas on both lesion-based and patient-based approaches. <b>Results:</b> For identifying lymphoma vs. sarcoidosis, physicians’ pooled sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy were 0.99 (CI95%:0.97-1.00), 0.75 (CI95%: 0.68-0.81), 0.87 (CI95%: 0.84-0.90) and 89.3%, respectively, whereas for identifying HL in the tumor population, it was 0.58 (CI95%: 0.49-0.66), 0.82 (CI95%: 0.74-0.89), 0.70 (CI95%: 0.64-0.75) and 68.5%, respectively. A moderate agreement was found between observers for the diagnosis of lymphoma vs. sarcoidosis and HL vs. DLBCL with Fleiss kappa values of 0.66 (CI95%: 0.45-0.87) and 0.69 (CI95%: 0.45-0.93), respectively. The best ML models for identifying lymphoma vs. sarcoidosis showed AUC of 0.94 (CI95%: 0.93-0.95) and 0.85 (CI95%: 0.82-0.88) in lesion- and patient-based approaches, respectively, using TLR radiomics (+ age for the second). To differentiate HL and DLBCL, we obtained AUC of 0.95 (CI95%: 0.93-0.96) in lesion-based approach using TLR radiomics, and 0.86 (CI95%: 0.80-0.91) in patient-based using original radiomics and age. <b>Conclusion:</b> Characterization of sarcoidosis and lymphoma lesions is feasible using ML and radiomics, with very good to excellent performances, equivalent or better than those of doctors who showed significant interobserver variability in their assessment.","Pierre Lovinfosse,Marta S.

Radiomics features were extracted from the second phase of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method was used to screen optimal features and construct a radiomics signature in the training cohort. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to establish a radiomics nomogram model based on the radiomics signature and clinical factors. The predictive performance of the nomogram was quantified with respect to discrimination and calibration, which was further evaluated in the independent validation cohort. Results Fourteen ALN metastasis-related features were selected to construct the radiomics signature, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.847 and 0.805 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The nomogram was established by incorporating the histological grade, multifocality, MRI report lymph node status and radiomics signature and showed good calibration and excellent performance for ALN detection (AUC of 0.907 and 0.874 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively).

Few studies have focused on the identification of factors that may influence the classification performance of radiomics models. The goal of this study was to use contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) images to identify factors that may potentially influence the performance of radiomics models in diagnosing breast lesions.A total of 157 women with 161 breast lesions were included. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and the random forest (RF) algorithm were employed to construct radiomics models. The classification result for each lesion was obtained by using 100 rounds of five-fold cross-validation. The image features interpreted by the radiologists were used in the exploratory factor analyses. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the association between the image features and misclassification. Additional exploratory analyses were performed to examine the findings.Among the lesions misclassified by both LASSO and RF ≥ 20% of the iterations in the cross-validation and those misclassified by both algorithms ≤5% of the iterations, univariate analysis showed that larger lesion size and the presence of rim artifacts and/or ripple artifacts were associated with more misclassifications among benign lesions, and smaller lesion size was associated with more misclassifications among malignant lesions (all p < 0.050). Multivariate analysis showed that smaller lesion size (odds ratio [OR] = 0.699, p = 0.002) and the presence of air trapping artifacts (OR = 35.568, p = 0.025) were factors that may lead to misclassification among malignant lesions. Additional exploratory analyses showed that benign lesions with rim artifacts and small malignant lesions (< 20 mm) with air trapping artifacts were misclassified by approximately 50% more in rate compared with benign and malignant lesions without these factors.Lesion size and artifacts in CEM images may affect the diagnostic performance of radiomics models. The classification results for lesions presenting with certain factors may be less reliable.","Yuqi Sun,Yuqi Sun,Simin Wang,Simin Wang,Ziang Liu,Ziang Liu,Chao You,Chao You,Ruimin Li,Ruimin Li,Ning Mao,Shaofeng Duan,Ning Mao,Henry Lynn,Shaofeng Duan,Henry S Lynn,Yajia Gu,Yajia Gu,Yajia Gu",Cancer Imaging,2022.0

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely used for local and nodal staging of RC by using morphological criteria. The actual dimensional and morphological criteria for nodal assessment present several limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity. For these reasons, several different techniques, such as Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM), Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI), and Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DCE) in MRI have been introduced but still not fully validated. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT plays a pivotal role in the assessment of LNs; more recently PET/MRI has been introduced. The advantages and limitations of these imaging modalities will be provided in this narrative review. The second part of the review includes experimental techniques, such as iron-oxide particles (SPIO), and dual-energy CT (DECT).

Multifocality (P = .033); the appearance of capsular continuity, compared with an absent or discontinuous capsule (P = .012); and a higher radiomic signature based on nodular and perinodular features (P = .030) were associated with poorer PFS in early-stage HCC. The observation size, presence of arterial hyperenhancement, nonperipheral washout, and appearance of an enhancing ""capsule"" were not associated with PFS (P > .05).Although multifocal HCC clearly indicates a more aggressive phenotype even in early-stage disease, the continuity of an enhancing capsule and a higher radiomic signature may add value as MR imaging biomarkers for poor PFS in HCC treated with RF ablation.","Alexandra Petukhova-Greenstein,Tal Zeevi,Alexandra Petukhova-Greenstein,Junlin Yang,Tal Zeevi,Nathan Chai,Junlin Yang,Nathan Chai,Paul DiDomenico,Yanhong Deng,Paul DiDomenico,Maria Ciarleglio,Yanhong Deng,Maria Ciarleglio,Stefan P.

10.3390/diagnostics12051085,,,MRI-Based Radiomic Features Help Identify Lesions and Predict Histopathological Grade of Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer. Radiomics is a promising tool that may increase the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the management of HCC. The purpose of our study is to develop an MRI-based radiomics approach to preoperatively detect HCC and predict its histological grade. Thirty-eight HCC patients at staging who underwent axial T2-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) were considered. Three-dimensional volumes of interest (VOIs) were manually placed on HCC lesions and normal hepatic tissue (HT) on arterial phase post-contrast images. Radiomic features from T2 images and arterial, portal and tardive post-contrast images from DCE-MRI were extracted by using Pyradiomics. Feature selection was performed using correlation filter, Wilcoxon-rank sum test and mutual information. Predictive models were constructed for HCC differentiation with respect to HT and HCC histopathologic grading used at each step an imbalance-adjusted bootstrap resampling (IABR) on 1000 samples. Promising results were obtained from radiomic prediction models, with best AUCs ranging from 71% to 96%. Radiomics MRI based on T2 and DCE-MRI revealed promising results concerning both HCC detection and grading. It may be a suitable tool for personalized treatment of HCC patients and could also be used to develop new prognostic biomarkers useful for HCC assessment without the need for invasive procedures.","Valentina Brancato,Valentina Brancato,Nunzia Garbino,Nunzia Garbino,Marco Salvatore,Marco Salvatore,Carlo Cavaliere,Carlo Cavaliere",Diagnostics,2022.0
10.3389/fonc.2022.811347,35296027.0,,MRI-Based Radiomics Nomogram: Prediction of Axillary Non-Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients With Sentinel Lymph Node-Positive Breast Cancer.,"Overtreatment of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) may occur in patients with axillary positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) but negative non-SLN (NSLN). Developing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics nomogram to predict axillary NSLN metastasis in patients with SLN-positive breast cancer could effectively decrease the probability of overtreatment and optimize a personalized axillary surgical strategy.This retrospective study included 285 patients with positive SLN breast cancer. Fifty five of them had metastatic NSLNs and 230 had non-metastatic NSLNs. MRI-based radiomic features of primary tumors were extracted and MRI morphologic findings of the primary tumor and axillary lymph nodes were assessed. Four models, namely, a radiomics signature, an MRI-clinical nomogram, and two MRI-clinical-radiomics nomograms were established based on MRI morphologic findings, clinicopathologic characteristics, and MRI-based radiomic features to predict the NSLN status. The optimal predictors in each model were selected using the 5-fold cross-validation (CV) method. Their predictive performances were determined by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis. The area under the curves (AUCs) of different models was compared by the Delong test. Their discrimination capability, calibration curve, and clinical usefulness were also assessed.The 5-fold CV analysis showed that the AUCs ranged from 0.770 to 0.847 for the radiomics signature, from 0.720 to 0.824 for the MRI-clinical nomogram, from 0.843 to 0.932 for the MRI-clinical-radiomics nomogram. The optimal predictive factors in the radiomics signature, MRI-clinical nomogram, and MRI-clinical-radiomics nomogram were one texture feature of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), two clinicopathologic features together with one MRI morphologic finding, and the DWI-based texture feature together with the two clinicopathologic features plus the one MRI morphologic finding, respectively. The MRI-clinical-radiomics nomogram with CA 15-3 included achieved the highest AUC compared with the radiomics signature (0.868 vs. 0.806, P <0.001) and MRI-clinical nomogram (0.868 vs. 0.761; P <0.001). In addition, the MRI-clinical-radiomics nomogram without CA 15-3 showed a higher performance than that of the radiomics signature (AUC, 0.852 vs. 0.806, P = 0.016) and the MRI-clinical nomogram (AUC, 0.852 vs. 0.761, P = 0.007). The MRI-clinical-radiomics nomograms showed good discrimination and good calibration. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the MRI-clinical-radiomics nomograms were clinically useful.The MRI-clinical-radiomics nomograms developed in our study showed high predictive performance, which can be used to predict the axillary NSLN status in SLN-positive breast cancer patients before surgery.","Ya Qiu,Ya Qiu,Xiang Zhang,Zhiyuan Wu,Xiang Zhang,Shi-Ji Wu,Zhiyuan Wu,Zehong Yang,Shiji Wu,Dongye Wang,Zehong Yang,Dongye Wang,Hongbo Le,Jiaji Mao,Hongbo Le,Jiaji Mao,Guochao Dai,Xuwei Tian,Guochao Dai,Xuwei Tian,Renbing Zhou,Jiayi Huang,Renbing Zhou,Lanjuan Hu,Jiayi Huang,Jun Shen,Lanxin Hu,Jun Shen",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0
10.3389/fonc.2022.876624,,,MRI-Based Radiomics for Preoperative Prediction of Lymphovascular Invasion in Patients With Invasive Breast Cancer,"Objective Preoperative identification of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in patients with invasive breast cancer is challenging due to absence of reliable biomarkers or tools in clinical settings. We aimed to establish and validate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomic models to predict the risk of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in patients with invasive breast cancer. Methods This retrospective study included a total of 175 patients with confirmed invasive breast cancer who had known LVI status and preoperative MRI from two tertiary centers. The patients from center 1 was randomly divided into a training set (n=99) and a validation set (n = 26), while the patients from center 2 was used as a test set (n=50). A total of 1409 radiomic features were extracted from the T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), respectively. A three-step feature selection including SelectKBest, interclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was performed to identify the features most associated with LVI. Subsequently, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was trained to develop single-layer radiomic models and fusion radiomic models. Model performance was evaluated and compared by the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Results Based on one feature of wavelet-HLH_gldm_GrayLevelVariance, the ADC radiomic model achieved an AUC of 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.80–0.94) in the training set, 0.87 (0.70-1.00) in the validation set, and 0.77 (95%CI: 0.64-0.86) in the test set. However, the combination of radiomic features derived from other MR sequences failed to yield incremental value. Conclusions ADC-based radiomic model demonstrated a favorable performance in predicting LVI prior to surgery in patients with invasive breast cancer. Such model holds the potential for improving clinical decision-making regarding treatment for breast cancer.","Mayidili Nijiati,Di-li-a-re-mu Ai-hai-ti,Mayidili Nijiati,Ai-si-ka-er-jiang Huo-jia,Diliaremu Aihaiti,Abudukeyoumujiang Abulizi,Aisikaerjiang Huojia,Sailidan Mutailifu,Abudukeyoumujiang Abulizi,Sailidan Mutailifu,Nu-er-a-mi-na Rou-zi,Nueramina Rouzi,Guo-zhao Dai,Patiman Maimaiti,Guozhao Dai,Patiman Maimaiti",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0

These pregnancies were divided into a training (n = 133), an independent validation (n = 57), and an external validation (n = 81) cohort. Radiomic features were extracted from images of transverse oblique T2-weighted imaging. A radiomics signature was constructed. A nomogram, composed of MRI morphological findings, radiomic features, and prenatal clinical characteristics, was developed. The discrimination and calibration of the nomogram were conducted to assess its performance.A radiomics signature, including three PAS-related features, was associated with the presence of PAS in the three cohorts (p < 0.001 to p = 0.001). An MRI-radiomics-clinical nomogram incorporating radiomics signature, two prenatal clinical features, and two MRI morphological findings was developed, yielding a higher area under the curve (AUC) than that of the MRI morphological-determined PAS in the training cohort (0.89 vs. 0.78; p < 0.001) and external validation cohort (0.87 vs. 0.75; p = 0.003), while a comparable AUC value in the validation cohort (0.91 vs. 0.81; p = 0.09). The calibration was good.An MRI-radiomics-clinical nomogram had a robust performance in antenatal predicting the PAS in pregnancies.• An MRI-radiomics-clinical-based nomogram might serve as an adjunctive approach for the treatment decision-making in pregnancies suspicious of PAS. • The radiomic score provides a mathematical formula that predicts the possibility of PAS by using the MRI data, and pregnant women with PAS had higher radiomic scores than those without PAS.","Lulu Peng,Lulu Peng,Xiang Zhang,Xiang Zhang,Jue Liu,Liu Yi,Jue Liu,Jianwei Huang,Jianwei Huang,Yi Liu,Junwei Chen,Jianwei Huang,Junwei Chen,Yun Su,Yun Su,Zehong Yang,Zehong Yang,Ting Song,Ting Song",European Radiology,2022.0

10.3390/cancers14112605,,,"Meningioma Radiomics: At the Nexus of Imaging, Pathology and Biomolecular Characterization","Meningiomas are the most common extra-axial tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). Even though recurrence is uncommon after surgery and most meningiomas are benign, an aggressive behavior may still be exhibited in some cases. Although the diagnosis can be made by radiologists, typically with magnetic resonance imaging, qualitative analysis has some limitations in regard to outcome prediction and risk stratification. The acquisition of this information could help the referring clinician in the decision-making process and selection of the appropriate treatment. Following the increased attention and potential of radiomics and artificial intelligence in the healthcare domain, including oncological imaging, researchers have investigated their use over the years to overcome the current limitations of imaging. The aim of these new tools is the replacement of subjective and, therefore, potentially variable medical image analysis by more objective quantitative data, using computational algorithms. Although radiomics has not yet fully entered clinical practice, its potential for the detection, diagnostic, and prognostic characterization of tumors is evident. In this review, we present a wide-ranging overview of radiomics and artificial intelligence applications in meningioma imaging.","Lorenzo Ugga,Lorenzo Ugga,Gaia Spadarella,Gaia Spadarella,Lorenzo Pinto,Lorenzo Pinto,Renato Cuocolo,Renato Cuocolo,Arturo Brunetti,Arturo Brunetti",Cancers,2022.0

Our study aims to provide a timely and rapid assessment of the prognosis of CRC patients with deep learning according to non-invasive preoperative computed tomography (CT) and explore the underlying biological explanations. Methods: A total of 808 CRC patients with preoperative CT (development cohort: n = 426, validation cohort: n = 382) were enrolled in our study. We proposed a novel end-to-end Multi-Size Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN) to predict the risk of CRC recurrence with CT images (CT signature). The prognostic performance of CT signature was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier curve. An integrated nomogram was constructed to improve the clinical utility of CT signature by combining with other clinicopathologic factors. Further visualization and correlation analysis for CT deep features with paired gene expression profiles were performed to reveal the molecular characteristics of CRC tumors learned by MSCNN in radiographic imaging. Results: The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that CT signature was a significant prognostic factor for CRC disease-free survival (DFS) prediction [development cohort: hazard ratio (HR): 50.7, 95% CI: 28.4–90.6, p &amp;lt; 0.001; validation cohort: HR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.44–2.89, p &amp;lt; 0.001]. Multivariable analysis confirmed the independence prognostic value of CT signature (development cohort: HR: 30.7, 95% CI: 19.8–69.3, p &amp;lt; 0.001; validation cohort: HR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.19–2.83, p = 0.006). Dimension reduction and visualization of CT deep features demonstrated a high correlation with the prognosis of CRC patients. Functional pathway analysis further indicated that CRC patients with high CT signature presented down-regulation of several immunology pathways. Correlation analysis found that CT deep features were mainly associated with activation of metabolic and proliferative pathways. Conclusions: Our deep learning based preoperative CT signature can effectively predict prognosis of CRC patients. Integration analysis of multi-omic data revealed that some molecular characteristics of CRC tumor can be captured by deep learning in CT images.","Cheng‐Hang Li,Du Cai,Cheng-Hang Li,Min-Er Zhong,Du Cai,Min-Er Zhong,Min‐Yi Lv,Zhichao Huang,Min-Yi Lv,Ze-Ping Huang,Qiqi Zhu,Qiqi Zhu,Chuling Hu,Chuling Hu,Haoning Qi,Xiaojian Wu,Haoning Qi,Xiaojian Wu,Feng Gao,Feng Gao",Frontiers in Genetics,2022.0
10.1364/boe.450294,35414973.0,,Polarization imaging-based radiomics approach for the staging of liver fibrosis.,"Mueller matrix imaging contains abundant biological microstructure information and has shown promising potential in clinical applications. Compared with the ordinary unpolarized light microscopy that relies on the spatial resolution to reveal detailed histological features, Mueller matrix imaging encodes rich information on the microstructures even at low-resolution and wide-field conditions. Accurate staging of liver fibrosis is essential for the therapeutic diagnosis and prognosis of chronic liver diseases. In the clinic, pathologists commonly use semiquantitative numerical scoring systems to determine the stages of liver fibrosis based on the visualization of stained characteristic morphological changes, which require skilled staining technicians and well-trained pathologists. A polarization imaging based quantitative diagnostic method can help to reduce the time-consuming multiple staining processes and provide quantitative information to facilitate the accurate staging of liver fibrosis. In this study, we report a polarization imaging based radiomics approach to provide quantitative diagnostic features for the staging of liver fibrosis. Comparisons between polarization image features under a 4× objective lens with H&E image features under 4×, 10×, 20×, and 40× objective lenses were performed to highlight the superiority of the high dimensional polarization image features in the characterization of the histological microstructures of liver fibrosis tissues at low-resolution and wide-field conditions.","Yao Ya,Fengdi Zhang,Yue Yao,Fengdi Zhang,Bin Wang,Jiachen Wan,Bin Wang,Jiachen Wan,Lu Si,Yonggui Dong,Lu Si,Yang Dong,Yuanhuan Zhu,Xiaolong Liu,Yuanhuan Zhu,Lihong Chen,Xiaolong Liu,Hui Ma,Lihong Chen,Hui Ma",Biomedical Optics Express,2022.0

The NAR score, which takes into account the pathological tumour and nodal stage as well as clinical tumour stage, is a validated surrogate endpoint used for early determination of treatment response whereby a low NAR score (< 8) has been correlated with better outcomes and high NAR score (> 16) has been correlated with poorer outcomes. CT images of 191 patients with LARC were used in this study. Primary tumour (GTV) and mesorectum (CTV) were contoured separately and radiomics features were extracted from both segments. Two NAR models (NAR > 16 and NAR < 8) models were constructed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and the survival models were constructed using regularized Cox regressions. Area under curve (AUC) and time-dependent AUC were used to quantify the performance of the LASSO and Cox regression respectively, using ten folds cross validations. The NAR > 16 and NAR < 8 models have an average AUCs of 0.68 ± 0.13 and 0.59 ± 0.14 respectively. There are statistically significant differences between the clinical and combined model for LRFFS (from 0.68 ± 0.04 to 0.72 ± 0.04), DMFS (from 0.68 ± 0.05 to 0.70 ± 0.05) and OS (from 0.64 ± 0.06 to 0.66 ± 0.06). CTV radiomics features were also found to be more important than GTV features in the NAR prediction model.

Methods A total of 303 cases with pathologically confirmed IDC from January 2018 to March 2021 were enrolled in this study, including 223 cases from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (training/test set) and 80 cases from Shaoxing Central Hospital (validation set). All the cases were classified as HR+/Luminal, HER2-enriched, and TNBC according to immunohistochemistry. DCE-MRI original images were treated by semi-automated segmentation to initially extract original and wavelet-transformed radiomic features. The extended logistic regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty was applied to identify the optimal radiomic features, which were then used to establish predictive models combined with significant clinical risk factors. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis were adopted to evaluate the effectiveness and clinical benefit of the models established. Results Of the 223 cases from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, HR+/Luminal cancers were diagnosed in 116 cases (52.02%), HER2-enriched in 71 cases (31.84%), and TNBC in 36 cases (16.14%). Based on the training set, 788 radiomic features were extracted in total and 8 optimal features were further identified, including 2 first-order features, 1 gray-level run length matrix (GLRLM), 4 gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM), and 1 3D shape feature. Three multi-class classification models were constructed by extended logistic regression: clinical model (age, menopause, tumor location, Ki-67, histological grade, and lymph node metastasis), radiomic model, and combined model. The macro-average areas under the ROC curve (macro-AUC) for the three models were 0.71, 0.81, and 0.84 in the training set, 0.73, 0.81, and 0.84 in the test set, and 0.76, 0.82, and 0.83 in the validation set, respectively.

10.1007/s00330-022-08880-7,,,Quantification and reduction of cross-vendor variation in multicenter DWI MR imaging: results of the Cancer Core Europe imaging task force,"Abstract Objectives In the Cancer Core Europe Consortium (CCE), standardized biomarkers are required for therapy monitoring oncologic multicenter clinical trials. Multiparametric functional MRI and particularly diffusion-weighted MRI offer evident advantages for noninvasive characterization of tumor viability compared to CT and RECIST. A quantification of the inter- and intraindividual variation occurring in this setting using different hardware is missing. In this study, the MRI protocol including DWI was standardized and the residual variability of measurement parameters quantified. Methods Phantom and volunteer measurements (single-shot T2w and DW-EPI) were performed at the seven CCE sites using the MR hardware produced by three different vendors. Repeated measurements were performed at the sites and across the sites including a traveling volunteer, comparing qualitative and quantitative ROI-based results including an explorative radiomics analysis. Results For DWI/ADC phantom measurements using a central post-processing algorithm, the maximum deviation could be decreased to 2%. However, there is no significant difference compared to a decentralized ADC value calculation at the respective MRI devices. In volunteers, the measurement variation in 2 repeated scans did not exceed 11% for ADC and is below 20% for single-shot T2w in systematic liver ROIs. The measurement variation between sites amounted to 20% for ADC and &lt; 25% for single-shot T2w. Explorative radiomics classification experiments yield better results for ADC than for single-shot T2w. Conclusion Harmonization of MR acquisition and post-processing parameters results in acceptable standard deviations for MR/DW imaging. MRI could be the tool in oncologic multicenter trials to overcome the limitations of RECIST-based response evaluation. Key Points • Harmonizing acquisition parameters and post-processing homogenization, standardized protocols result in acceptable standard deviations for multicenter MR–DWI studies. • Total measurement variation does not to exceed 11% for ADC in repeated measurements in repeated MR acquisitions, and below 20% for an identical volunteer travelling between sites. • Radiomic classification experiments were able to identify stable features allowing for reliable discrimination of different physiological tissue samples, even when using heterogeneous imaging data.","Oliver Sedlaczek,Oliver Lukas Sedlaczek,Jens Kleesiek,Jens Kleesiek,Ferdia A.

Methods: A total of 178 PTC patients were randomly divided into a training (n = 125) and a test cohort (n = 53) with a 7:3 ratio. A total of 2553 radiomic features were extracted from noncontrast, arterial contrast-enhanced and venous contrast-enhanced CT images of each patient. Principal component analysis (PCA) and Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) were used for feature selection. Logistic regression was employed to build clinical–radiological, radiomics and combined models. A nomogram was developed by combining the radiomics features, CT-reported lymph node status and clinical factors. Results: The radiomics model showed a predictive performance similar to that of the clinical–radiological model, with similar areas under the curve (AUC) and accuracy (ACC). The combined model showed an optimal predictive performance in both the training (AUC, 0.868; ACC, 86.83%) and test cohorts (AUC, 0.878; ACC, 83.02%).

10.3390/diagnostics12051064,,,Radiomics in Early Lung Cancer Diagnosis: From Diagnosis to Clinical Decision Support and Education,"Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer-related death around the world. With the recent introduction of low-dose lung computed tomography for lung cancer screening, there has been an increasing number of smoking- and non-smoking-related lung cancer cases worldwide that are manifesting with subsolid nodules, especially in Asian populations. However, the pros and cons of lung cancer screening also follow the implementation of lung cancer screening programs. Here, we review the literature related to radiomics for early lung cancer diagnosis. There are four main radiomics applications: the classification of lung nodules as being malignant/benign; determining the degree of invasiveness of the lung adenocarcinoma; histopathologic subtyping; and prognostication in lung cancer prediction models.

10.1186/s12891-022-05389-4,35524240.0,,Radiomics nomogram based on dual-energy spectral CT imaging to diagnose low bone mineral density,"Abstract Background Osteoporosis is associated with a decrease of bone mineralized component as well as a increase of bone marrow fat. At present, there are few studies using radiomics nomogram based fat-water material decomposition (MD) images of dual-energy spectral CT as an evaluation method of abnormally low Bone Mineral Density (BMD). This study aims to establish and validate a radiomics nomogram based the fat-water imaging of dual-energy spectral CT in diagnosing low BMD. Methods Ninety-five patients who underwent dual-energy spectral CT included T11-L2 and dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were collected. The patients were divided into two groups according to T-score, normal BMD(T ≥ -1) and abnormally low BMD (T &lt; -1). Radiomic features were selected from fat-water imaging of the dual-energy spectral CT. Radscore was calculated by summing the selected features weighted by their coefficients. A nomogram combining the radiomics signature and significant clinical variables was built. The ROC curve was performed to evaluate the performance of the model. Finally, we used decision curve analysis (DCA) to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the model. Results Five radiomic features based on fat-water imaging of dual-energy spectral CT were constructed to distinguish abnormally low BMD from normal BMD, and its differential performance was high with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.89–1.00) in the training cohort and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.91–1.00) in the test cohort. The radiomics nomogram showed excellent differential ability with AUC of 0.96 (95%CI, 0.91–1.00) in the training cohort and 0.98 (95%CI, 0.93–1.00) in the test cohort, which performed better than the radiomics model and clinics model only. The DCA showed that the radiomics nomogram had a higher benefit in differentiating abnormally low BMD from normal BMD than the clinical model alone. Conclusion The radiomics nomogram incorporated radiomics features and clinical factor based the fat-water imaging of dual-energy spectral CT may serve as an efficient tool to identify abnormally low BMD from normal BMD well.","Qianqian Yao,Qianqian Yao,Mengke Liu,Mengke Liu,Kexin Yuan,Kemei Yuan,Xin Yue,Xiaoqian Qiu,Yue Xin,Xiuzhu Zheng,Xiaoqian Qiu,Xiuzhu Zheng,Changqin Li,Changqin Li,Shaofeng Duan,Jian Qin,Shaofeng Duan,Jian Qin",BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders,2022.0

10.3390/cancers14102363,35625967.0,,Radiophysiomics: Brain Tumors Classification by Machine Learning and Physiological MRI Data,"The precise initial characterization of contrast-enhancing brain tumors has significant consequences for clinical outcomes. Various novel neuroimaging methods have been developed to increase the specificity of conventional magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) but also the increased complexity of data analysis. Artificial intelligence offers new options to manage this challenge in clinical settings. Here, we investigated whether multiclass machine learning (ML) algorithms applied to a high-dimensional panel of radiomic features from advanced MRI (advMRI) and physiological MRI (phyMRI; thus, radiophysiomics) could reliably classify contrast-enhancing brain tumors. The recently developed phyMRI technique enables the quantitative assessment of microvascular architecture, neovascularization, oxygen metabolism, and tissue hypoxia. A training cohort of 167 patients suffering from one of the five most common brain tumor entities (glioblastoma, anaplastic glioma, meningioma, primary CNS lymphoma, or brain metastasis), combined with nine common ML algorithms, was used to develop overall 135 classifiers. Multiclass classification performance was investigated using tenfold cross-validation and an independent test cohort. Adaptive boosting and random forest in combination with advMRI and phyMRI data were superior to human reading in accuracy (0.875 vs. 0.850), precision (0.862 vs. 0.798), F-score (0.774 vs. 0.740), AUROC (0.886 vs. 0.813), and classification error (5 vs. 6). The radiologists, however, showed a higher sensitivity (0.767 vs. 0.750) and specificity (0.925 vs. 0.902). We demonstrated that ML-based radiophysiomics could be helpful in the clinical routine diagnosis of contrast-enhancing brain tumors; however, a high expenditure of time and work for data preprocessing requires the inclusion of deep neural networks.","Andreas Stadlbauer,Andreas Stadlbauer,Franz Marhold,Franz Marhold,Stefan Oberndorfer,Stefan Oberndorfer,Gertraud Heinz,Michael Buchfelder,Gertraud Heinz,Thomas M.

10.1177/15330338221099113,35521966.0,,Robustness Assessment of Images From a 0.35T Scanner of an Integrated MRI-Linac: Characterization of Radiomics Features in Phantom and Patient Data.,"Purpose: Radiomics entails the extraction of quantitative imaging biomarkers (or radiomics features) hypothesized to provide additional pathophysiological and/or clinical information compared to qualitative visual observation and interpretation. This retrospective study explores the variability of radiomics features extracted from images acquired with the 0.35 T scanner of an integrated MRI-Linac. We hypothesized we would be able to identify features with high repeatability and reproducibility over various imaging conditions using phantom and patient imaging studies. We also compared findings from the literature relevant to our results. Methods: Eleven scans of a Magphan® RT phantom over 13 months and 11 scans of a ViewRay Daily QA phantom over 11 days constituted the phantom data. Patient datasets included 50 images from ten anonymized stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) pancreatic cancer patients (50 Gy in 5 fractions). A True Fast Imaging with Steady-State Free Precession (TRUFI) pulse sequence was selected, using a voxel resolution of 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm and 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm × 3.0 mm for phantom and patient data, respectively. A total of 1087 shape-based, first, second, and higher order features were extracted followed by robustness analysis. Robustness was assessed with the Coefficient of Variation (CoV < 5%). Results: We identified 130 robust features across the datasets. Robust features were found within each category, except for 2 second-order sub-groups, namely, Gray Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM) and Neighborhood Gray Tone Difference Matrix (NGTDM). Additionally, several robust features agreed with findings from other stability assessments or predictive performance studies in the literature. Conclusion: We verified the stability of the 0.35 T scanner of an integrated MRI-Linac for longitudinal radiomics phantom studies and identified robust features over various imaging conditions. We conclude that phantom measurements can be used to identify robust radiomics features. More stability assessment research is warranted.","Rebecka Ericsson-Szecsenyi,Geoffrey Zhang,Rebecka Ericsson-Szecsenyi,Gage Redler,Geoffrey Zhang,Vladimir Feygelman,Gage Redler,Stephen A.

Long-course neoadjuvant chemo-radiation was performed according to local policy. On simulation CT, the rectal Gross Tumor Volume was manually segmented. A feature selection process was performed yielding mineable data through an in-house developed software (written in Python 3.6). Model selection and hyper-parametrization of the model was performed using a fivefold cross validation approach. The main outcome measure of the study was the rate of pathologic good response, defined as the sum of Tumor regression grade (TRG) 3 and 4 according to Dworak's classification.Two-hundred and one patients were included in our analysis, of whom 126 (62.7%) and 75 (37.3%) cases represented the explorative and external validation cohorts, respectively. Patient characteristics were well balanced between the two groups. A similar rate of good response to neoadjuvant treatment was obtained in in both cohorts (46% and 54.7%, respectively; p = 0.247). A total of 1150 features were extracted from the planning scans. A 5-metafeature complex consisting of Principal component analysis (PCA)-clusters (whose main components are LHL Grey-Level-Size-Zone: Large Zone Emphasis, Elongation, HHH Intensity Histogram Mean, HLL Run-Length: Run Level Variance and HHH Co-occurence: Cluster Tendency) in combination with 5-nearest neighbour model was the most robust signature. When applied to the explorative cohort, the prediction of good response corresponded to an average Area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.65 ± 0.02. When the model was tested on the external validation cohort, it ensured a similar accuracy, with a slightly lower predictive ability (AUC of 0.63).Radiomics-based, data-mining from simulation CT scans was shown to be feasible and reproducible in two independent cohorts, yielding fair accuracy in the prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemo-radiation.","Pierluigi Bonomo,Jairo Socarras Fernandez,Pierluigi Bonomo,Jairo Socarras Fernandez,Daniela Thorwarth,M.

Most PET quantification approaches depend on spatial normalization of PET images to brain template; however, the spatial normalization and quantification approaches have not been comprehensively reviewed. In this review, we introduced and compared PET template-based and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-aided spatial normalization approaches. Tracer-specific and age-specific PET brain templates were surveyed between 1999 and 2021 for 18F-FDG, 11C-PIB, 18F-Florbetapir, 18F-THK5317, and etc., as well as adaptive PET template methods. Spatial normalization-based PET quantification approaches were reviewed, including region-of-interest (ROI)-based and voxel-wise quantitative methods. Spatial normalization-based ROI segmentation approaches were introduced, including manual delineation on template, atlas-based segmentation, and multi-atlas approach. Voxel-wise quantification approaches were reviewed, including voxel-wise statistics and principal component analysis. Certain concerns and representative examples of clinical applications were provided for both ROI-based and voxel-wise quantification approaches. At last, a recipe for PET spatial normalization and quantification approaches was concluded to improve diagnosis accuracy of neurological disorders in clinical practice.","Teng Zhang,Teng Zhang,Shuang Wu,Shuang Wu,Mengjie Zhang,Xiaohui Zhang,Yiwu Dai,Yiwu Dai,Anxin Wang,Anxin Wang,Hong Zhang,Hong Zhang,Mei Tian,Mei Tian",European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging,2022.0
10.1002/nbm.4754,35485596.0,,Synthetic MRI improves Radiomics‐based glioblastoma survival prediction,"Glioblastoma is an aggressive and fast-growing brain tumor with poor prognosis. Predicting the expected survival of these patients is a key task for efficient treatment and surgery planning. Survival predictions could be enhanced by means of a radiomic system. However, these systems demand high amounts of multicontrast images, the acquisitions of which are time consuming, giving rise to patient discomfort and low healthcare system efficiency. Synthetic MRI could favor deployment of radiomic systems in the clinic by allowing practitioners not only to reduce acquisition time, but also to retrospectively complete databases or to replace artifacted images. In this work we analyze the replacement of an actually acquired MR weighted image by a synthesized counterversion for predicting survival of glioblastoma patients with a radiomic system. Each synthesized counterversion was realistically generated from two acquired images with a deep learning synthetic MRI approach based on a CNN. Specifically, two weighted images were considered for the replacement, namely a T2w and a FLAIR, one at a time, which were synthesized from the pairs T1w and FLAIR, and T1w and T2w, respectively. Furthermore, a radiomic system for survival prediction, which can classify patients in two groups (survival > 480 days and ≤ 480 days), was built. Results show that the radiomic system fed with the synthesized image achieves similar performance compared to using the acquired one, and better performance than a model that does not include that image. Hence, our results confirm that synthetic MRI does add up to glioblastoma survival prediction within a radiomics-based approach.","Elisa Moya-Sáez,Rafael Navarro‐González,Elisa Moya-Sáez,Rafael Navarro-González,Santiago Cepeda,Ángel Pérez-Núñez,Santiago Cepeda,Rodrigo de Luis‐García,Ángel Pérez-Núñez,Santiago Aja‐Fernández,Rodrigo de Luis-García,Santiago Aja-Fernández,Carlos Alberola-López,Carlos Alberola-López",NMR in Biomedicine,2022.0

Radiomics features were extracted from T1-precontrast weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) using MaZda software (version 4.6; Institute of Electronics, Technical University of Lodz). We performed dimension reduction to obtain 30 optimal features of each sequence, respectively. A PSO-SVM radiomics model was developed to predict DD and LNM of ECC by incorporating radiomics features and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. We randomly divided the 110 cases into a training group (88/110, 80%) and a testing group (22/110, 20%). The performance of the model was evaluated by analyzing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> A radiomics model based on PSO-SVM was developed by using 110 patients with ECC. This model produced average AUCs of 0.8905 and 0.8461, respectively, for DD in the training and testing groups of patients with ECC. The average AUCs of the LNM in the training and testing groups of patients with ECC were 0.9036 and 0.8889, respectively. For the 110 patients, this model has high predictive performance. The average accuracy values of the training group and testing group for DD of ECC were 82.6% and 80.9%, respectively; the average accuracy values of the training group and testing group for LNM of ECC were 83.6% and 81.2%, respectively. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> The MRI-based PSO-SVM radiomics model might be useful for auxiliary clinical diagnosis and decision-making, which has a good potential for clinical application for DD and LNM of ECC. </sec>","Xiaopeng Yao,Xiaopeng Yao,Xinqiao Huang,Xiaopeng Yao,Chunmei Yang,Xinqiao Huang,Chunmei Yang,Anbin Hu,Guangjin Zhou,Anbin Hu,Guangjin Zhou,Jianbo Lei,Jianbo Lei,Jiwu Shu,Jian Shu",,

Patients were randomly divided into training (n=188) and validation (n=47) datasets. Four feature selection methods with nine classifiers were implemented to select the optimal machine learning (ML) model using five-fold cross-validation. A radiomic signature was constructed using a linear ML algorithm, and a radiomic score (Radscore) was calculated. The combined model was developed with the Radscore, the significant clinical and radiologic factors were selected using multivariable logistic regression, and the results were presented as a clinical radiomic nomogram. A prospective pilot study was also conducted to compare the classification performance of the combined nomogram with practicing radiologists.Significant differences were found in the Radscore between IFI and bacterial pneumonia patients in the training (0.683 vs. -0.724, P<0.001) and validation set (0.353 vs. -0.717, P=0.002). The combined model showed good discrimination performance in the validation cohort [area under the curve (AUC) =0.844] and outperformed the clinical (AUC =0.696) and radiomics (AUC =0.767) model alone (both P<0.05).The clinical radiomic nomogram can serve as a promising predictive tool for IFI in patients with hematologic malignancies.","Changqing Yan,Hao Peng,Chenggong Yan,Peng Hao,Guangyao Wu,Jie Lin,Guangyao Wu,Jie Lin,Jun Xu,Jun Xu,Tianjing Zhang,Tianjing Zhang,Xiangying Li,Haixia Li,Xiangying Li,Sibin Wang,Haixia Li,Yu Xu,Sibin Wang,Henry C.

10.21203/rs.2.14001/v2,,,Prediction of the clinicopathological subtypes of breast cancer using a Fisher discriminant analysis model based on radiomic features ofdiffusion-weighted MRI,"Abstract Background: The clinicopathological classification of breast cancer is proposed according to therapeutic purposes. It is simplified and can be conducted easily in clinical practice, and this subtyping undoubtedly contributes to the treatment selection of breast cancer. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using a Fisher discriminant analysis model based on radiomic features of diffusion-weighted MRI for predicting the clinicopathological subtypes of breast cancer. Methods: Patients who underwent breast magnetic resonance imaging were confirmed by retrieving data from our institutional picture archiving and communication system (PACS) between March 2013 and September 2017. Five clinicopathological subtypes were determined based on the status of ER, PR, HER2 and Ki-67 from the immunohistochemical test. The radiomic features of diffusion-weighted imaging were derived from the volume of interest (VOI) of each tumour. Fisher discriminant analysis was performed for clinicopathological subtyping by using a backward selection method. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the radiomic features, ROC analyses were performed to differentiate between immunohistochemical biomarker-positive and -negative groups. Results: A total of 84 radiomic features of four statistical methods were included after preprocessing. The overall accuracy for predicting the clinicopathological subtypes was 96.4% by Fisher discriminant analysis, and the weighted accuracy was 96.6%. For predicting diverse clinicopathological subtypes, the prediction accuracies ranged from 92% to 100%. According to the cross-validation, the overall accuracy of the model was 82.1%, and the accuracies of the model for predicting the luminal A, luminal B HER2- , luminal B HER2+ , HER2 positive and triple negative subtypes were 79%, 77%, 88%, 92% and 73%, respectively. According to the ROC analysis, the radiomic features had excellent performance in differentiating between different statuses of ER, PR, HER2 and Ki-67. Conclusions: The Fisher discriminant analysis model based on radiomic features of diffusion-weighted MRI is a reliable method for the prediction of clinicopathological breast cancer subtypes.","Ming Ni,Xiaoming Zhou,Ming Ni,Xiaoming Zhou,Jingwei Liu,Jingwei Liu,Haiyang Yu,Haiyang Yu,Yong Gao,Xuexi Zhang,Yuanxiang Gao,Zhiming Li,Xuexi Zhang,Zhiming Li",,

Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 436 patients (mean age, 51 years; age range, 18-86 years; 319 men [mean age, 51 years; age range, 18-86 years]; 117 women [mean age, 50 years; age range, 18-79 years]) with pathologic analysis-proven liver fibrosis who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI from June 2015 to December 2016 were randomized in a three-to-one ratio into development (n = 329) and test (n = 107) cohorts, respectively. In the development cohort, a model was developed to calculate radiomics fibrosis index (RFI) by using logistic regression with elastic net regularization to differentiate stage F3-F4 from stage F0-F2. Optimal RFI cutoffs to diagnose clinically significant fibrosis (stage F2-F4), advanced fibrosis (stage F3-F4), and cirrhosis (stage F4) were determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. In the test cohort, the diagnostic performance of RFI was compared with that of normalized liver enhancement, aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), and fibrosis-4 index by using the Obuchowski index. Results In the test cohort, RFI (Obuchowski index, 0.86) significantly outperformed normalized liver enhancement (Obuchowski index, 0.77; P < .03), APRI (Obuchowski index, 0.60; P < .001), and fibrosis-4 index (Obuchowski index, 0.62; P < .001) for staging liver fibrosis. By using the cutoffs, RFI had sensitivities and specificities as follows: 81% (95% confidence interval: 71%, 89%) and 78% (95% confidence interval: 63%, 89%) for diagnosing stage F2-F4, respectively; 79% (95% confidence interval: 67%, 88%) and 82% (95% confidence interval: 69%, 91%), respectively, for diagnosing stage F3-F4; and 92% (95% confidence interval: 79%, 98%) and 75% (95% confidence interval: 62%, 83%), respectively, for diagnosing stage F4.

Method 110 patients who had CIS after conization and finally underwent hysterectomy were collected to comprise a database to establish an imaging model for predicting the residual status after conization. The imaging features were extracted from the cervical areas around the conization margin, and the performance of the imaging model was compared using different feature selection methods and with that of the pathological positive margins using receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis. Then, patients who opted for uterine preservation were included and were classified as high-risk or low-risk patients according to the radiomics model. The disease-free survival was compared between the different risk groups using the Kaplan-Meier curve. Results The model with Boruta features achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.889 and an accuracy of 87.3% in the test cohort and significantly outperformed the model created with the random forest method, which had an AUC of 0.701 (p = 0.039), and the positive margins (p = 0.004). Further validation with patients with uterine preservation showed that the patients classified as high risk with the radiomics model were more likely to have tumor recurrence/residual disease in the follow-up period than low-risk patients(p = 0.024). Conclusions Radiomics can be used to identify residual disease in patients with CIS after cervical conization and could have the potential to predict recurrence in patients who opt for uterine preservation.","Mengfan Song,Jing Lin,Mengfan Song,Fuzhen Song,Jing Lin,Zhaoxia Qian,Fuzhen Song,Guangyu Wu,Zhaoxia Qian,Dan Wu,Guangyu Wu,Dan Wu",,

Materials and Methods One hundred forty-one patients with rectal cancer (58 in LNM+ group, 83 in LNM- group) who underwent preoperative total abdominal DECT were divided into a training group and testing group (7:3 ratio). After post-processing DECT venous phase images, 120kVp-like images and iodine (water) images were obtained. The highest-risk lymph nodes were identified, and their long-axis and short-axis diameter and DECT quantitative parameters were measured manually by two experienced radiologists who were blind to the postoperative pathological results. Four DECT parameters were analyzed: arterial phase (AP) normalized iodine concentration, AP normalized effective atomic number, the venous phase (VP) normalized iodine concentration, and the venous phase normalized effective atomic number. The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were recorded one week before surgery. Radiomics features of the largest lymph nodes were extracted, standardized, and reduced before modeling. Radomics signatures of 120kVp-like images (Rad-signature 120kVp ) and iodine map (Rad-signature Imap ) were built based on Logistic Regression via Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Results Eight hundred thirty-three features were extracted from 120kVp-like and iodine images, respectively. In testing group, the radiomics features based on 120kVp-like images showed the best diagnostic performance (AUC=0.922) compared to other predictors [CT morphological indicators (short-axis diameter (AUC=0.779, IDI=0.262) and long-axis diameter alone (AUC=0.714, IDI=0.329)), CEA alone (AUC=0.540, IDI=0.414), and normalized DECT parameters alone (AUC=0.504-0.718, IDI=0.290-0.476)]( P &amp;lt;0.05 in Delong test). Contrary, DECT iodine map-based radiomic signatures showed similar performance in predicting lymph node metastasis (AUC=0.866).

10.3390/app12125829,,,A Machine Learning and Radiomics Approach in Lung Cancer for Predicting Histological Subtype,"Lung cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Computed Tomography (CT) images are a powerful tool for investigating the structure and texture of lung nodules. For a long time, trained radiologists have performed the grading and staging of cancer severity by relying on radiographic images. Recently, radiomics has been changing the traditional workflow for lung cancer staging by providing the technical and methodological means to analytically quantify lesions so that more accurate predictions could be performed while reducing the time required from each specialist to perform such tasks. In this work, we implemented a pipeline for identifying a radiomic signature composed of a reduced number of features to discriminate between adenocarcinomas and other cancer types. In addition, we also investigated the reproducibility of this radiomic study analysing the performances of the classification models on external validation data. In detail, we first considered two publicly available datasets, namely D1 and D2, composed of n = 262 and n = 89 samples, respectively. Ten significant features, according to univariate AUC evaluated on D1, were retained. Mann–Whitney U tests recognised three of these features to have a statistically different distribution, with a p-value &lt; 0.05. Then, we collected n = 51 CT images from patients with lung nodules at the Azienda Ospedaliero—Universitaria “Policlinico Riuniti” in Foggia. Resident radiologists manually annotated the lung lesions in images to allow the subsequent analysis of the malignancy regions. We designed a pipeline for feature extraction from the Volumes of Interest in order to generate a third dataset, i.e., D3. Several experiments have been performed showing that the selected radiomic signature not only allowed the discrimination of lung adenocarcinoma from other cancer types independently from the input dataset used for training the models, but also allowed reaching good classification performances also on external validation data; in fact, the radiomic signature computed on D1 and evaluated on the local cohort allowed reaching an AUC of 0.70 (p&lt;0.001) for the task of predicting the histological subtype.","Antonio Brunetti,Antonio Brunetti,Nicola Altini,Antonio Brunetti,Domenico Buongiorno,Nicola Altini,Domenico Buongiorno,Emilio Garolla,Emilio Garolla,Fabio Corallo,Matteo Gravina,Fabio Corallo,Matteo Gravina,Vitoantonio Bevilacqua,Vitoantonio Bevilacqua,Berardino Prencipe,Berardino Prencipe",Applied sciences,2022.0
10.1245/s10434-022-11958-7,,,A Multiomics Signature Highlights Alterations Underlying Homologous Recombination Deficiency in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"BackgroundHomologous recombination (HR) is a key pathway in DNA double-strand damage repair. HR deficiency (HRD) occurs more commonly in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) than in other breast cancer subtypes. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the value of HRD in stratifying breast cancer patients into distinct groups based on their responses to poly(ADP ribose) polymerase inhibitors and chemotherapy.MethodsWe retrospectively collected TNBC samples to establish a multiomics cohort (n = 343) and explored the biological and phenotypic mechanisms underlying the better prognosis of patients with high HRD scores. Gene set enrichment analysis was conducted to elucidate the underlying pathways in patients with low HRD scores, and a radiomics model was established to predict the HRD score via a noninvasive method.ResultsMultivariable Cox analysis revealed the independent prognostic value of a low HRD score (hazard ratio 2.20, 95% confidence interval 1.05–4.59; p = 0.04). Furthermore, amino acid and lipid metabolism pathways were highly enriched in tumors from patients with low HRD scores, which was also demonstrated by differential abundant metabolite analysis. A noninvasive radiomics method was developed to predict the HRD status and it performed well in the independent validation cohort (support vector machine model: area under the curve [AUC] 0.739, sensitivity 0.571, and specificity 0.824; logistic regression model: AUC 0.695, sensitivity 0.571, and specificity 0.882).ConclusionsWe revealed the prognostic value of the HRD score, predicted the HRD status with noninvasive radiomics features, and preliminarily explored druggable targets for TNBC patients with low HRD scores.","Guan-Hua Su,Guan-Hua Su,Lin Jiang,Yi Xiao,Lin Jiang,Rencheng Zheng,Yi Xiao,Ren-Cheng Zheng,He Wang,Yi‐Zhou Jiang,He Wang,Peng Weijun,Yi-Zhou Jiang,Wei-Jun Peng,Zhi-Ming Shao,Zhi-Ming Shao,Yajia Gu,Ya-Jia Gu,Chao You,Chao You",Annals of Surgical Oncology,2022.0
10.3389/fonc.2022.865548,,,A Radiomics Nomogram Integrated With Clinic-Radiological Features for Preoperative Prediction of DNA Mismatch Repair Deficiency in Gastric Adenocarcinoma,"Purpose To develop and validate a radiomics nomogram integrated with clinic-radiological features for preoperative prediction of DNA mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) in gastric adenocarcinoma. Materials and Methods From March 2014 to August 2020, 161 patients with pathologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma were included from two centers (center 1 as the training and internal testing sets, n = 101; center 2 as the external testing sets, n = 60). All patients underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) examination. Radiomics features were extracted from portal-venous phase CT images. Max-relevance and min-redundancy (mRMR) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods were used to select features, and then radiomics signature was constructed using logistic regression analysis. A radiomics nomogram was built incorporating the radiomics signature and independent clinical predictors. The model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results The radiomics signature, which was constructed using two selected features, was significantly associated with dMMR gastric adenocarcinoma in the training and internal testing sets ( P &amp;lt; 0.05). The radiomics signature model showed a moderate discrimination ability with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.81 in the training set, which was confirmed with an AUC of 0.78 in the internal testing set. The radiomics nomogram consisting of the radiomics signature and clinical factors (age, sex, and location) showed excellent discrimination in the training, internal testing, and external testing sets with AUCs of 0.93, 0.82, and 0.83, respectively. Further, calibration curves and DCA analysis demonstrated good fit and clinical utility of the radiomics nomogram. Conclusions The radiomics nomogram combining radiomics signature and clinical characteristics (age, sex, and location) may be used to individually predict dMMR of gastric adenocarcinoma.","Yahan Tong,Jiaying Li,Yahan Tong,Jiaying Li,Jieyu Chen,Jieyu Chen,Can Hu,Zhiyuan Xu,Can Hu,Zhiyuan Xu,Shaofeng Duan,Shaofeng Duan,Xiaojie Wang,Ri‐Sheng Yu,Xiaojie Wang,Risheng Yu,Xiuzhen Cheng,Xiangdong Cheng",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0

10.1007/s40618-022-01837-z,35751803.0,,Artificial intelligence-based radiomics on computed tomography of lumbar spine in subjects with fragility vertebral fractures,"PurposeThere is emerging evidence that radiomics analyses can improve detection of skeletal fragility. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated radiomics features (RFs) on computed tomography (CT) images of the lumbar spine in subjects with or without fragility vertebral fractures (VFs).MethodsTwo-hundred-forty consecutive individuals (mean age 60.4 ± 15.4, 130 males) were evaluated by radiomics analyses on opportunistic lumbar spine CT. VFs were diagnosed in 58 subjects by morphometric approach on CT or XR-ray spine (D4-L4) images. DXA measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) was performed on 17 subjects with VFs.ResultsTwenty RFs were used to develop the machine learning model reaching 0.839 and 0.789 of AUROC in the train and test datasets, respectively. After correction for age, VFs were significantly associated with RFs obtained from non-fractured vertebrae indicating altered trabecular microarchitecture, such as low-gray level zone emphasis (LGLZE) [odds ratio (OR) 1.675, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.215–2.310], gray level non-uniformity (GLN) (OR 1.403, 95% CI 1.023–1.924) and neighboring gray-tone difference matrix (NGTDM) contrast (OR 0.692, 95% CI 0.493–0.971). Noteworthy, no significant differences in LGLZE (p = 0.94), GLN (p = 0.40) and NGDTM contrast (p = 0.54) were found between fractured subjects with BMD T score < − 2.5 SD and those in whom VFs developed in absence of densitometric diagnosis of osteoporosis.ConclusionsArtificial intelligence-based analyses on spine CT images identified RFs associated with fragility VFs. Future studies are needed to test the predictive value of RFs on opportunistic CT scans in identifying subjects with primary and secondary osteoporosis at high risk of fracture.","Emilia Biamonte,E Biamonte,Riccardo Levi,Flaminia Carrone,R Levi,F Carrone,Walter Vena,W Vena,Arturo Brunetti,A Brunetti,Massimiliano Battaglia,Federico Garoli,M Battaglia,F Garoli,Giovanni Savini,Marco Riva,G Savini,M Riva,Alessandro Ortolina,A Ortolina,Massimo Tomei,Giovanni Angelotti,M Tomei,G Angelotti,Maria Elena Laino,Victor Savevski,M E Laino,V Savevski,Maximiliano Mollura,M Mollura,Maurizio Fornari,M Fornari,Riccardo Barbieri,Andrea Lania,R Barbieri,A G Lania,Marco Grimaldi,M Grimaldi,Letterio S.

10.3390/diagnostics12071660,35885564.0,,Automated Classification of Atherosclerotic Radiomics Features in Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA),"Radiomics is the process of extracting useful quantitative features of high-dimensional data that allows for automated disease classification, including atherosclerotic disease. Hence, this study aimed to quantify and extract the radiomic features from Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) images and to evaluate the performance of automated machine learning (AutoML) model in classifying the atherosclerotic plaques. In total, 202 patients who underwent CCTA examination at Institut Jantung Negara (IJN) between September 2020 and May 2021 were selected as they met the inclusion criteria. Three primary coronary arteries were segmented on axial sectional images, yielding a total of 606 volume of interest (VOI). Subsequently, the first order, second order, and shape order of radiomic characteristics were extracted for each VOI. Model 1, Model 2, Model 3, and Model 4 were constructed using AutoML-based Tree-Pipeline Optimization Tools (TPOT). The heatmap confusion matrix, recall (sensitivity), precision (PPV), F1 score, accuracy, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and area under the curve (AUC) were analysed. Notably, Model 1 with the first-order features showed superior performance in classifying the normal coronary arteries (F1 score: 0.88; Inverse F1 score: 0.94), as well as in classifying the calcified (F1 score: 0.78; Inverse F1 score: 0.91) and mixed plaques (F1 score: 0.76; Inverse F1 score: 0.86). Moreover, Model 2 consisting of second-order features was proved useful, specifically in classifying the non-calcified plaques (F1 score: 0.63; Inverse F1 score: 0.92) which are a key point for prediction of cardiac events. Nevertheless, Model 3 comprising the shape-based features did not contribute to the classification of atherosclerotic plaques. Overall, TPOT shown promising capabilities in terms of finding the best pipeline and tailoring the model using CCTA-based radiomic datasets.","Mardhiyati Mohd Yunus,Mardhiyati Mohd Yunus,Ahmad Khairuddin Mohamed Yusof,Ahmad Khairuddin Mohamed Yusof,Muhd Zaidi Ab Rahman,Muhd Zaidi Ab Rahman,Xue Jing Koh,Xue Jing Koh,Akmal Sabarudin,Akmal Sabarudin,Puteri N E Nohuddin,Puteri N.

10.1038/s41598-022-14178-x,35710850.0,,Building reliable radiomic models using image perturbation,"Radiomic model reliability is a central premise for its clinical translation. Presently, it is assessed using test-retest or external data, which, unfortunately, is often scarce in reality. Therefore, we aimed to develop a novel image perturbation-based method (IPBM) for the first of its kind toward building a reliable radiomic model. We first developed a radiomic prognostic model for head-and-neck cancer patients on a training (70%) and evaluated on a testing (30%) cohort using C-index. Subsequently, we applied the IPBM to CT images of both cohorts (Perturbed-Train and Perturbed-Test cohort) to generate 60 additional samples for both cohorts. Model reliability was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) to quantify consistency of the C-index among the 60 samples in the Perturbed-Train and Perturbed-Test cohorts. Besides, we re-trained the radiomic model using reliable RFs exclusively (ICC > 0.75) to validate the IPBM. Results showed moderate model reliability in Perturbed-Train (ICC: 0.565, 95%CI 0.518-0.615) and Perturbed-Test (ICC: 0.596, 95%CI 0.527-0.670) cohorts. An enhanced reliability of the re-trained model was observed in Perturbed-Train (ICC: 0.782, 95%CI 0.759-0.815) and Perturbed-Test (ICC: 0.825, 95%CI 0.782-0.867) cohorts, indicating validity of the IPBM. To conclude, we demonstrated capability of the IPBM toward building reliable radiomic models, providing community with a novel model reliability assessment strategy prior to prospective evaluation.","Xinzhi Teng,Xinzhi Teng,Jiang Zhang,Jiang Zhang,Alex Zwanenburg,Alex Zwanenburg,Jiachen Sun,Yuhua Huang,Jiachen Sun,Yuhua Huang,Saikit Lam,Saikit Lam,Yuanpeng Zhang,Bing Li,Yuanpeng Zhang,Zhou Ta,Bing Li,Ta Zhou,Haonan Xiao,Haonan Xiao,Chenyang Liu,Wen Li,Chenyang Liu,Wen Li,Xinyang Han,Xinyang Han,Zongrui Ma,Zongrui Ma,Tian Li,Jing Cai,Tian Li,Jing Cai",Scientific Reports,2022.0
10.3389/fonc.2022.896002,35875140.0,,CT-Based Radiomics Nomogram Improves Risk Stratification and Prediction of Early Recurrence in Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Partial Hepatectomy,"Objectives To develop and validate an intuitive computed tomography (CT)-based radiomics nomogram for the prediction and risk stratification of early recurrence (ER) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after partial hepatectomy. Methods A total of 132 HCC patients treated with partial hepatectomy were retrospectively enrolled and assigned to training and test sets. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and gradient boosting decision tree were used to extract quantitative radiomics features from preoperative contrast-enhanced CT images of the HCC patients. The radiomics features with predictive value for ER were used, either alone or in combination with other predictive features, to construct predictive models. The best performing model was then selected to develop an intuitive, simple-to-use nomogram, and its performance in the prediction and risk stratification of ER was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results The radiomics model based on the radiomics score (Rad-score) achieved AUCs of 0.870 and 0.890 in the training and test sets, respectively. Among the six predictive models, the combined model based on the Rad-score, Edmondson grade, and tumor size had the highest AUCs of 0.907 in the training set and 0.948 in the test set and was used to develop an intuitive nomogram. Notably, the calibration curve and DCA for the nomogram showed good calibration and clinical application. Moreover, the risk of ER was significantly different between the high- and low-risk groups stratified by the nomogram ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions The CT-based radiomics nomogram developed in this study exhibits outstanding performance for ER prediction and risk stratification. As such, this intuitive nomogram holds promise as a more effective and user-friendly tool in predicting ER for HCC patients after partial hepatectomy.","Cuiyun Wu,Cuiyun Wu,Yu Shufeng,Shufeng Yu,Yang Zhang,Yang Zhang,Li Zhu,Li Zhu,Shuangxi Chen,Shuangxi Chen,Yang Liu,Yang Liu",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0
10.1016/j.phro.2022.06.010,,,Clinical and Radiomics Prediction of Complete Response in Rectal Cancer pre-Chemoradiotherapy,"<h2>Abstract</h2><h3>Background and purpose</h3> Patients with rectal cancer could avoid major surgery if they achieve clinical complete response (cCR) post neoadjuvant treatment. Therefore, prediction of treatment outcomes before treatment has become necessary to select the best neo-adjuvant treatment option. This study investigates clinical and radiomics variables' ability to predict cCR in patients pre chemoradiotherapy. <h3>Materials and methods</h3> Using the OnCoRe database, we recruited a matched cohort of 304 patients (152 with cCR; 152 without cCR) deriving training (N = 200) and validation (N = 104) sets. We collected pre-treatment MR (magnetic resonance) images, demographics and blood parameters (haemoglobin, neutrophil, lymphocyte, alkaline phosphate and albumin). We segmented the gross tumour volume on T2 Weighted MR Images and extracted 1430 stable radiomics features per patient. We used principal component analysis (PCA) and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) to reduce dimensionality and evaluate the models produced. <h3>Results</h3> Using Logistic regression analysis, PCA-derived combined model (radiomics plus clinical variables) gave a ROC AUC of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.69–0.83) in the training set and 0.68 (95% CI 0.57–0.79) in the validation set. The clinical only model achieved an AUC of 0.73 (95% CI 0.66–0.80) and 0.62 (95% CI 0.51–0.74) in the training and validation set, respectively. The radiomics model had an AUC of 0.68 (95% CI 0.61–0.75) and 0.66 (95% CI 0.56–0.77) in the training and validation sets. <h3>Conclusion</h3> The predictive characteristics of both clinical and radiomics variables for clinical complete response remain modest but radiomics predictability is improved with addition of clinical variables.","Peter Mbanu,Mark Saunders,Peter Mbanu,Mark P Saunders,Hitesh Mistry,Hitesh Mistry,Joseph Mercer,Lee Malcomson,Joseph Mercer,S Yousif,Lee Malcomson,Saif Yousif,Gareth J Price,Gareth Price,Rohit Kochhar,Andrew G.

10.1093/ehjci/jeac092,35640278.0,,Decoding the radiomic and proteomic phenotype of epicardial adipose tissue associated with adverse left atrial remodelling and post-operative atrial fibrillation in aortic stenosis.,"Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) volume and attenuation on computed tomography (CT) have been associated with atrial fibrillation. Beyond these conventional CT measures, radiomics allows extraction of high-dimensional data and deep quantitative adipose tissue phenotyping, which may capture its underlying biology. We aimed to explore the EAT proteomic and CT-radiomic signatures associated with impaired left atrial (LA) remodelling and post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF).We prospectively included 132 patients with severe aortic stenosis with no prior atrial fibrillation referred for aortic valve replacement. Pre-operative non-contrast CT images were obtained for extraction of EAT volume and other radiomic features describing EAT texture. The LA function was assessed by 2D-speckle-tracking echocardiography peak atrial longitudinal strain and peak atrial contraction strain. The EAT biopsies were performed during surgery for proteomic analysis by sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectra (SWATH-MS). The POAF incidence was monitored from surgery until discharge. Impaired LA function and incident POAF were associated with EAT up-regulation of inflammatory and thrombotic proteins, and down-regulation of cardioprotective proteins with anti-inflammatory and anti-lipotoxic properties. The EAT volume was independently associated with LA enlargement, impaired function, and POAF risk. On CT images, EAT texture of patients with POAF was heterogeneous and exhibited higher maximum grey-level values than sinus rhythm patients, which correlated with up-regulation of inflammatory and down-regulation of lipid droplet-formation EAT proteins. The CT radiomics of EAT provided an area under the curve of 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.68-0.92) for discrimination between patients with POAF and sinus rhythm.Pre-operative CT-radiomic profile of EAT detected adverse EAT proteomics and identified patients at risk of developing POAF.","Jennifer Mâncio,Jennifer Mancio,Fábio Sousa-Nunes,Fabio Sousa-Nunes,Rosário Martíns,Rafael Martins,Mariana Fragão-Marques,Mariana Fragao-Marques,Gloria Conceicao,Glória Conceição,Guilherme Pessoa-Amorim,Guilherme Pessoa-Amorim,Antonio S Barros,António S.

Methods In total, 242 patients with STS (training set, n=116; external validation set, n=126) who underwent magnetic resonance imaging were retrospectively enrolled in this study. We identified independent predictors for LM-status and evaluated their performance. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) method and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were adopted to screen radiomics features. Logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and adaptive boosting classifiers were compared for their ability to predict LM. To overcome the imbalanced distribution of the LM data, we retrained each machine-learning classifier using the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE). A DLRN combining the independent clinical predictors with the best performing radiomics prediction signature (mRMR+LASSO+SVM+SMOTE) was established. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess the performance and clinical applicability of the models. Result Comparisons of the AUC values applied to the external validation set revealed that the DLRN model (AUC=0.833) showed better prediction performance than the clinical model (AUC=0.664) and radiomics model (AUC=0.799). The calibration curves indicated good calibration efficiency and the DCA showed the DLRN model to have greater clinical applicability than the other two models.

Our study includes 107 patients with stage 4 NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab-based therapy (monotherapy: 30%, combination chemotherapy: 70%). The ITK-SNAP software was used for 3D tumor volume segmentation from pre-therapy CT scans. Radiomic features (n = 102) were extracted using the CaPTk software. Impact of heterogeneity introduced by image physical dimensions (voxel spacing parameters) and acquisition parameters (contrast enhancement and CT reconstruction kernel) was mitigated by resampling the images to the minimum voxel spacing parameters and harmonization by a nested ComBat technique. This technique was initialized with radiomic features, clinical factors of age, sex, race, PD-L1 expression, ECOG status, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, recurrence event and months of progression-free survival, and image acquisition parameters as batch variables. Two phenotypes were identified using unsupervised hierarchical clustering of harmonized features. Prognostic factors, including PDL1 expression, ECOG status, BMI and smoking status, were combined with radiomic phenotypes in Cox regression models of PFS and Kaplan Meier (KM) curve-fitting. Cox model based on clinical factors had a c-statistic of 0.57, which increased to 0.63 upon addition of phenotypes derived from harmonized features. There were statistically significant differences in survival outcomes stratified by clinical covariates, as measured by the log-rank test (p = 0.034), which improved upon addition of phenotypes (p = 0.00022). We found that mitigation of heterogeneity by image resampling and nested ComBat harmonization improves prognostic value of phenotypes, resulting in better prediction of PFS when added to other prognostic variables.","Alok Kumar Singh,Apurva Singh,Hannah Horng,Leonid Roshkovan,Hannah Horng,Leonid Roshkovan,Joanna K.

Results In five-fold cross-validation, the HCR model, DL model, and the ensemble of HCR and DL models achieved accuracies of 76.2 ± 6.8, 77.9 ± 4.6, and 85.2 ± 2.7%, respectively. For the diagnosis of IPF and non-IPF ILDs on the external test set, the HCR, DL, and the ensemble of HCR and DL models achieved accuracies of 76.1, 77.9, and 85.3%, respectively. The ensemble model outperformed the diagnostic performance of clinicians who achieved a mean accuracy of 66.3 ± 6.7% ( p &amp;lt; 0.05) during the in-silico trial. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the ensemble model on the test set was 0.917 which was significantly higher than the HCR model (0.817, p = 0.02) and the DL model (0.823, p = 0.005). The agreement between HCR and DL models was 61.4%, and the accuracy and specificity for the predictions when both the models agree were 93 and 97%, respectively. SHAP analysis showed the texture features as the most important features for IPF diagnosis and Grad-CAM showed that the model focused on the clinically relevant part of the image. Conclusion Deep learning and HCR models can complement each other and serve as useful clinical aids for the diagnosis of IPF and non-IPF ILDs.","Turkey Refaee,Turkey Refaee,Zohaib Salahuddin,Zohaib Salahuddin,Anne‐Noëlle Frix,Anne-Noelle Frix,Changqing Yan,Chenggong Yan,Guangyao Wu,Henry C.

10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2022.06.1014,,,International Union of Angiology (IUA) consensus paper on imaging strategies in atherosclerotic carotid artery imaging: From basic strategies to advanced approaches,"<h2>Abstract</h2> Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and disability in developed countries. According to WHO, an estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2019, representing 32% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% were due to major adverse cardiac and cerebral events. Early detection and care for individuals at high risk could save lives, alleviate suffering, and diminish economic burden associated with these diseases. Carotid artery disease is not only a well-established risk factor for ischemic stroke, contributing to 10%–20% of strokes or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), but it is also a surrogate marker of generalized atherosclerosis and a predictor of cardiovascular events. In addition to diligent history, physical examination, and laboratory detection of metabolic abnormalities leading to vascular changes, imaging of carotid arteries adds very important information in assessing stroke and overall cardiovascular risk. Spanning from carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) measurements in arteriopathy to plaque burden, morphology and biology in more advanced disease, imaging of carotid arteries could help not only in stroke prevention but also in ameliorating cardiovascular events in other territories (e.g. in the coronary arteries). While ultrasound is the most widely available and affordable imaging methods, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), their combination and other more sophisticated methods have introduced novel concepts in detection of carotid plaque characteristics and risk assessment of stroke and other cardiovascular events. However, in addition to robust progress in usage of these methods, all of them have limitations which should be taken into account. The main purpose of this consensus document is to discuss pros but also cons in clinical, epidemiological and research use of all these techniques.","Luca Saba,Luca Saba,Pier Luigi Antignani,Pier Luigi Antignani,Ajay Gupta,Ajay Gupta,Riccardo Cau,Kosmas I.

Here we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of MRI-based radiomics in the differentiation of fat-poor AMLs from other renal neoplasms. Methods A total of 69 patients with solid renal tumors without macroscopic fat and with a pathologic diagnosis of RCC (n=50) or mf-AML (n=19) who underwent conventional MRI and intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) were included. Clinical data including age, sex, tumor location, urine creatinine, and urea nitrogen were collected from medical records. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), pure diffusion coefficient (D), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), and perfusion fraction ( f ) were measured from renal tumors. We used the ITK-SNAP software to manually delineate the regions of interest on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and IVIM-DWI from the largest cross-sectional area of the tumor. We extracted 396 radiomics features by the Analysis Kit software for each MR sequence. The hand-crafted features were selected by using the Pearson correlation analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Diagnostic models were built by logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed using five-fold cross-validation and the mean area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated and compared between the models to obtain the optimal model for the differentiation of mf-AML and RCC. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical utility of the models. Results Clinical model based on urine creatinine achieved an AUC of 0.802 (95%CI: 0.761-0.843). IVIM-based model based on f value achieved an AUC of 0.692 (95%CI: 0.627-0.757). T2WI-radiomics model achieved an AUC of 0.883 (95%CI: 0.852-0.914). IVIM-radiomics model achieved an AUC of 0.874 (95%CI: 0.841-0.907). Combined radiomics model achieved an AUC of 0.919 (95%CI: 0.894-0.944). Clinical-radiomics model yielded the best performance, with an AUC of 0.931 (95%CI: 0.907-0.955). The calibration curve and DCA confirmed that the clinical-radiomics model had a good consistency and clinical usefulness. Conclusion The clinical-radiomics model may be served as a noninvasive diagnostic tool to differentiate mf-AML with RCC, which might facilitate the clinical decision-making process.","Lian Jian,Lian Jian,Yan Liu,Yan Liu,Yuan Xie,Sanyuan Jiang,Yu Xie,Shusuan Jiang,Mingji Ye,Mingji Ye,Huashan Lin,Huashan Lin",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0

Radiomics features were extracted from the morphological MRI images and screened using the Select K Best and LASSO algorithm. Three-step machine learning models with XGBoost, SVM, and DT algorithms were developed to classify the parotid neoplasms into four subtypes. The ROC curve was used to measure the performance in each step. Diagnostic confusion matrices of these models were calculated for the test cohort and compared with those of the radiologists.ResultsSix, twelve, and eight optimal features were selected in each step of the three-step process, respectively. XGBoost produced the highest area under the curve (AUC) for all three steps in the training cohort (0.857, 0.882, and 0.908, respectively), and for the first step in the test cohort (0.826), but produced slightly lower AUCs than SVM in the latter two steps in the test cohort (0.817 vs. 0.833, and 0.789 vs. 0.821, respectively). The total accuracies of XGBoost and SVM in the confusion matrices (70.8% and 59.6%) outperformed those of DT and the radiologist (46.1% and 49.2%).ConclusionThis study demonstrated that machine learning models based on morphological MRI radiomics might be an assistive tool for parotid tumor classification, especially for preliminary screening in absence of more advanced scanning sequences, such as DWI.Key Points • Machine learning algorithms combined with morphological MRI radiomics could be useful in the preliminary classification of parotid tumors. • XGBoost algorithm performed better than SVM and DT in subtype differentiation of parotid tumors, while DT seemed to have a poor validation performance. • Using morphological MRI only, the XGBoost and SVM algorithms outperformed radiologists in the four-type classification task for parotid tumors, thus making these models a useful assistant diagnostic tool in clinical practice.","Zhiying He,Yun Mao,Zhiying He,Shanhong Lu,Yitao Mao,Lei Tan,Shanhong Lu,Lei Tan,Juxiong Xiao,Juxiong Xiao,Pingqing Tan,Hailin Zhang,Pingqing Tan,Li Guo,Hailin Zhang,Guo Li,Helei Yan,Jiaqi Tan,Helei Yan,Jiaqi Tan,Donghai Huang,Yuanzheng Qiu,Donghai Huang,Xin Zhang,Yuanzheng Qiu,Xingwei Wang,Xin Zhang,Xingwei Wang,Yong Liu,Yong Liu",European Radiology,2022.0

Methods: Patients with NPC and available pre-treatment as well as follow up PET/CT were included from 2005 to 2006 and were followed to 2021. Baseline demographic, radiological and outcome data were collected. Univariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate features from baseline and follow-up time points, and landmark analyses were performed for each time point. Results: Sixty patients were enrolled, and two-hundred and seventy-eight (278) PET/CT were at baseline and during follow-up. Thirty-eight percent (38%) were female, and sixty-two patients were male. All patients underwent curative radiation or chemoradiation therapy. The median follow-up was 11.72 years (1.26–14.86). Five-year and ten-year overall survivals (OSs) were 80.0% and 66.2%, and progression-free survival (PFS) was 90.0% and 74.4%. Time-dependent modelling suggested that, among others, PET gray-level zone length matrix (GLZLM) gray-level non-uniformity (GLNU) (HR 2.74 95% CI 1.06, 7.05) was significantly associated with OS. Landmark analyses suggested that CT parameters were most predictive at 15 month, whereas PET parameters were most predictive at time points 3, 6, 9 and 15 month. Conclusions: This study with long-term follow up data on NPC suggests that mainly PET-derived radiomic features are predictive for OS but not PFS in a time-dependent evaluation. Furthermore, CT radiomic measures may predict OS and PFS best at initial and long-term follow-up time points and PET measures may be more predictive in the interval. These modalities are commonly used in NPC surveillance, and prospective validation should be considered.","Adam A Dmytriw,Adam A Dmytriw,Claudia Ortega,Reut Anconina,Claudia Ortega,Reut Anconina,Ur Metser,Ur Metser,Zhihui A.

10.3390/diagnostics12071664,35885568.0,,Novel Survival Features Generated by Clinical Text Information and Radiomics Features May Improve the Prediction of Ischemic Stroke Outcome,"Background: Accurate outcome prediction is of great clinical significance in customizing personalized treatment plans, reducing the situation of poor recovery, and objectively and accurately evaluating the treatment effect. This study intended to evaluate the performance of clinical text information (CTI), radiomics features, and survival features (SurvF) for predicting functional outcomes of patients with ischemic stroke. Methods: SurvF was constructed based on CTI and mRS radiomics features (mRSRF) to improve the prediction of the functional outcome in 3 months (90-day mRS). Ten machine learning models predicted functional outcomes in three situations (2-category, 4-category, and 7-category) using seven feature groups constructed by CTI, mRSRF, and SurvF. Results: For 2-category, ALL (CTI + mRSRF+ SurvF) performed best, with an mAUC of 0.884, mAcc of 0.864, mPre of 0.877, mF1 of 0.86, and mRecall of 0.864. For 4-category, ALL also achieved the best mAuc of 0.787, while CTI + SurvF achieved the best score with mAcc = 0.611, mPre = 0.622, mF1 = 0.595, and mRe-call = 0.611. For 7-category, CTI + SurvF performed best, with an mAuc of 0.788, mPre of 0.519, mAcc of 0.529, mF1 of 0.495, and mRecall of 0.47. Conclusions: The above results indicate that mRSRF + CTI can accurately predict functional outcomes in ischemic stroke patients with proper machine learning models. Moreover, combining SurvF will improve the prediction effect compared with the original features. However, limited by the small sample size, further validation on larger and more varied datasets is necessary.","Guo Yingwei,Yingwei Guo,Yang Yingjian,Yingjian Yang,Fengqiu Cao,Fengqiu Cao,Wei Li,Wei Li,Mingming Wang,Mingming Wang,Yu Luo,Yu Luo,Jia Guo,Jia Guo,Asim Zaman,Asim Zaman,Xueqiang Zeng,Xueqiang Zeng,Xiaoqiang Miu,Xiaoqiang Miu,Longyu Li,Longyu Li,Weiyan Qiu,Weiyan Qiu,Yan Kang,Yan Kang",Diagnostics,2022.0
10.1259/bjr.20220072,35687700.0,,"Pancreatic cancer, Radiomics and Artificial Intelligence: A Review","Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are generally classified into four categories based on contrast-enhanced CT at diagnosis: resectable, borderline resectable, unresectable, and metastatic disease. In the initial grading and staging of PDAC, structured radiological templates are useful but limited, as there is a need to define the aggressiveness and microscopic disease stage of these tumours to ensure adequate treatment allocation. Quantitative imaging analysis allows radiomics and dynamic imaging features to provide information of clinical outcomes, and to construct clinical models based on radiomics signatures or imaging phenotypes. These quantitative features may be used as prognostic and predictive biomarkers in clinical decision making, enabling personalized management of advanced PDAC. Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks also provide high level bioinformatics tools that can help define features associated with a given aspect of PDAC biology and aggressiveness, paving the way to define outcomes based on these features. Thus, the prediction of tumour phenotype, treatment response and patient prognosis may be feasible by using such comprehensive and integrated radiomics models. Despite these promising results, quantitative imaging is not ready for clinical implementation in PDAC. Limitations include the instability of metrics and lack of external validation. Large properly annotated datasets, including relevant semantic features (demographics, blood markers, genomics), image harmonization, robust radiomics analysis, clinically significant tasks as outputs, comparisons with gold standards (such as TNM or pretreatment classifications) and fully independent validation cohorts, will be required for the development of trustworthy radiomics and Artificial Intelligence solutions to predict PDAC aggressiveness in a clinical setting.","Luis Martı́-Bonmatı́,Luis Martí-Bonmatí,Leonor Cerdá-Alberich,Alexandre Pérez-Enguix,Leonor Cerdá-Alberich,Roberto Díaz Beveridge,Alexandre Pérez-Enguix,Roberto Díaz Beveridge,Eva Montalvá Orón,Eva Montalvá Orón,Judith Pérez Rojas,Ángel Alberich‐Bayarri,Judith Pérez Rojas,Angel Alberich-Bayarri",British Journal of Radiology,2022.0
10.3390/app12125946,,,Prediction of Overall Survival in Cervical Cancer Patients Using PET/CT Radiomic Features,"Background: Radiomics is a field of research medicine and data science in which quantitative imaging features are extracted from medical images and successively analyzed to develop models for providing diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive information. The purpose of this work was to develop a machine learning model to predict the survival probability of 85 cervical cancer patients using PET and CT radiomic features as predictors. Methods: Initially, the patients were divided into two mutually exclusive sets: a training set containing 80% of the data and a testing set containing the remaining 20%. The entire analysis was separately conducted for CT and PET features. Genetic algorithms and LASSO regression were used to perform feature selection on the initial PET and CT feature sets. Two different survival models were employed: the Cox proportional hazard model and random survival forest. The Cox model was built using the subset of features obtained with the feature selection process, while all the available features were used for the random survival forest model. The models were trained on the training set; cross-validation was used to fine-tune the models and to obtain a preliminary measurement of the performance. The models were then validated on the test set, using the concordance index as the metric. In addition, alternative versions of the models were developed using tumor recurrence as an adjunct feature to evaluate its impact on predictive performance. Finally, the selected CT and PET features were combined to build a further Cox model. Results: The genetic algorithm was superior to the LASSO regression for feature selection. The best performing model was the Cox model, which was built using the selected CT features; it achieved a concordance index score of 0.707. With the addition of tumor recurrence as a predictive feature, the Cox CT model reached a concordance index score of 0.776. PET features, however, proved to be inadequate for survival prediction. The CT model performed better than the model with combined PET and CT features. Conclusions: The results showed that radiomic features can be used to successfully predict survival probability in cervical cancer patients. In particular, CT radiomic features proved to be better predictors than PET radiomic features in this specific case.","Gianluca Carlini,Nico Curti,Gianluca Carlini,Nico Curti,Silvia Strolin,Enrico Giampieri,Silvia Strolin,Enrico Giampieri,Claudia Sala,Claudia Sala,Daniele Dall’Olio,Daniele Dall’Olio,Alessandra Merlotti,Alessandra Merlotti,Stefano Fanti,Stefano Fanti,Daniel Remondini,Cristina Nanni,Daniel Remondini,Cristina Nanni,Lidia Strigari,Gastone Castellani,Lidia Strigari,Gastone Castellani",Applied sciences,2022.0

To build the classification models, the following workflow was followed: minimum-maximum scaling normalization method, recursive feature elimination based on ridge regression (Ridge-RFE), synthetic minority oversampling technique, and support vector machine classifier. We established several models based on the statistically significant features (Ridge-RFE selected) of each sequence to distinguish BPTs from BMPTs, including precontrast T1WI model, DCE-T1WI phase 1 model, T1WI feature fusion model, T2WI model, T1WI + T2WI model, clinical feature model, conventional MRI characteristics model, and combined clinical-radiomics model.Univariate analysis was utilized to compare variables between the BPT and BMPT groups. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of these models.In the training cohort, the clinical-radiomics model had excellent diagnostic efficiency, with an area under ROC (AUC) of 0.91 ± 0.02 (95% CI: 0.87-0.94).

A total of 1188 quantitative imaging features were extracted from dual-time PET/CT images. To avoid overfitting, the univariate analysis and elastic net were used to obtain a sparse set of image features that were applied to develop a radiomics score (Rad-score). Then, the Harrell consistency index (C-index) was used to evaluate the prognosis model.The Rad-score from dual-time images contains six features, including intensity histogram, morphological, and texture features. In the validation cohort, the univariate analysis showed that the Rad-score was the independent prognostic factor (p < 0.001, hazard ratio [HR]: 3.2). And in the multivariate analysis, the Rad-score was the only prognostic factor (p < 0.01, HR: 4.1) that was significantly associated with the overall survival (OS) of patients. In addition, according to cross-validation, the C-index of the prognosis model based on the Rad-score from dual-time images is better than the early and delayed images (0.720 vs. 0.683 vs. 0.583).The Rad-score based on dual-time 18F-FDG PET/CT images is a promising noninvasive method with better prognostic value.","Fei Wang,Fei Wang,Chao Cheng,Chao Cheng,Shengnan Ren,Shengnan Ren,Zhongyi Wu,Zhongyi Wu,Tao Wang,Tao Wang,Xiaodong Yang,Xiaodong Yang,Xiaokai Yang,Chuantao Zuo,Changjing Zuo,Zhuangzhi Yan,Zhuangzhi Yan,Zhaobang Liu,Zhaobang Liu,Zhaobang Liu",Journal of Oncology,2022.0

10.3390/app12115512,,,Robustness Analysis of DCE-MRI-Derived Radiomic Features in Breast Masses: Assessing Quantization Levels and Segmentation Agreement,"Machine learning models based on radiomic features allow us to obtain biomarkers that are capable of modeling the disease and that are able to support the clinical routine. Recent studies have shown that it is fundamental that the computed features are robust and reproducible. Although several initiatives to standardize the definition and extraction process of biomarkers are ongoing, there is a lack of comprehensive guidelines. Therefore, no standardized procedures are available for ROI selection, feature extraction, and processing, with the risk of undermining the effective use of radiomic models in clinical routine. In this study, we aim to assess the impact that the different segmentation methods and the quantization level (defined by means of the number of bins used in the feature-extraction phase) may have on the robustness of the radiomic features. In particular, the robustness of texture features extracted by PyRadiomics, and belonging to five categories—GLCM, GLRLM, GLSZM, GLDM, and NGTDM—was evaluated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and mean differences between segmentation raters. In addition to the robustness of each single feature, an overall index for each feature category was quantified. The analysis showed that the level of quantization (i.e., the `bincount’ parameter) plays a key role in defining robust features: in fact, in our study focused on a dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) dataset of 111 breast masses, sets with cardinality varying between 34 and 43 robust features were obtained with `binCount’ values equal to 256 and 32, respectively. Moreover, both manual segmentation methods demonstrated good reliability and agreement, while automated segmentation achieved lower ICC values. Considering the dependence on the quantization level, taking into account only the intersection subset among all the values of `binCount’ could be the best selection strategy. Among radiomic feature categories, GLCM, GLRLM, and GLDM showed the best overall robustness with varying segmentation methods.","Carmelo Militello,Carmelo Militello,Leonardo Rundo,Leonardo Rundo,Mariangela Dimarco,Mariangela Dimarco,Alessia Angela Maria Orlando,Alessia Angela Maria Orlando,I D'Angelo,Vincenzo Conti,Ildebrando D’Angelo,Tommaso Vincenzo Bartolotta,Vincenzo Conti,Tommaso Vincenzo Bartolotta",Applied sciences,2022.0

As the study of radiomics in cancer has become more advanced, the currently used methods have revealed their shortcomings. The performance of cancer radiomics based on single-modality medical images, which based on their imaging principles, only partially reflects tumor information, has been necessarily compromised. Using the whole tumor as a region of interest to extract radiomic features inevitably leads to the loss of intra-tumoral heterogeneity of, which also affects the performance of radiomics. Radiomics of multimodal images extracts various aspects of information from images of each modality and then integrates them together for model construction; thus, avoiding missing information. Subregional segmentation based on multimodal medical image combinations allows radiomics features acquired from subregions to retain tumor heterogeneity, further improving the performance of radiomics. In this review, we provide a detailed summary of the current research on the radiomics of multimodal images of cancer and tumor subregion-based radiomics, and then raised some of the research problems and also provide a thorough discussion on these issues.","Luyuan Zhang,Luyuan Zhang,Yumin Wang,Yumin Wang,Zhouying Peng,Zhouying Peng,Yuxiang Weng,Yuxiang Weng,Zebin Fang,Zebin Fang,Feng Xiao,Feng Xiao,Chao Zhang,Chao Zhang,Zuoxu Fan,Zuoxu Fan,Kejie Huang,Kaiyuan Huang,Yan Zhu,Yu Zhu,Weihong Jiang,Weihong Jiang,Jian Shen,Jian Shen,Renya Zhan,Ruoting Zhan",International Journal of Biological Sciences,2022.0

Data were divided into a training cohort (72 patients with 127 lesions from nine hospitals) and an independent test cohort (39 patients with 60 lesions from seven hospitals) according to the hospital in which the CT was performed. In all, 73 texture features were extracted from manually delineated lesion volumes, and 23 three-dimensional (3D) wavelets with eight decomposition modes were implemented to compare and validate the value of wavelet transformation for grade assessment. Finally, the optimal machine learning pipeline, valuable radiomic features, and final radiomic models were determined. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision curve were used to determine the diagnostic performance and clinical utility of the models.Of the 187 lesions, 108 (57.75%) were diagnosed as mild lesions and 79 (42.25%) as moderate/severe lesions. All selected radiomic features showed significant correlations with the grade of COVID-19 pulmonary lesions (P<0.05). Biorthogonal 1.1 (bior1.1) LLL was determined as the optimal wavelet transform mode. The wavelet transforming radiomic model had an AUC of 0.910 in the test cohort, outperforming the original radiomic model (AUC =0.880; P<0.05). Decision analysis showed the radiomic model could add a net benefit at any given threshold of probability.Wavelet transformation can enhance CT texture features.

A significant effort has been put to incorporate radiomics in the clinical setting, towards developing radiomics-based machine learning models from a large amount of images across multiple centers. However, multicenter radiomics has been proven to be sensitive to different scanner models, acquisition protocols and reconstruction settings, deriving imaging features of increased variability that hamper robustness and generalizability of the models. Recent literature has stressed the importance of utilizing harmonization techniques to compensate for multicenter effects. These include traditional image-based techniques and harmonization at the feature level using ComBat. The latter has been shown to have increased performance in several radiomics studies. To this end, this study investigated the capability of ComBat and M-ComBat to eliminate the “center-effect” of multicenter images from an heterogeneous TCIA public dataset. Both methods were tested on 102 patients with WHO grade IV glioblastomas and 64 patients with WHO grade II and III glioma and performance was assessed using a machine learning pipeline comprising combinations of different feature selection, data resampling and machine learning models.

Pretreatment PET/CT images from patients who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy from July 2002 to February 2017 were segmented, and data were split into training and test sets. Model development was performed on the training datasets and a maximum of five features were selected. Final diagnostic accuracies were determined using the test dataset. A total of 86 PET/CTs (58 men and 28 women, mean age 65 years) were segmented. Due to small lesion size, 12 patients were excluded. The diagnostic accuracies as derived from the CT, PET, and combined PET/CT test datasets were as follows: cT category-70.4%, 70.4%, and 81.5%, respectively; cN category-69.0%, 86.2%, and 86.2%, respectively; PET response-60.0%, 66.7%, and 70.0%, respectively; PFS-60.7%, 75.0%, and 75.0%, respectively; and OS-51.7%, 55.2%, and 62.1%, respectively.

However, the current interpretation of cardiac computed tomography (CT) images mainly depends on subjective and qualitative analysis. Radiomics uses advanced image analysis to extract numerous quantitative features from digital images that are unrecognizable to the naked eye. Visualization of these features can reveal underlying connections between image phenotyping and biological characteristics and support clinical outcomes. Although research into radiomics on cardiovascular disease began only recently, several studies have indicated its potential clinical value in assessing future cardiac risk and guiding prevention and management strategies. Our review aimed to summarize the current applications of cardiac CT radiomics in the cardiovascular field and discuss its advantages, challenges, and future directions.We searched for English-language articles published between January 2010 and August 2021 in the databases of PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar. The keywords used in the search included computed tomography or CT, radiomics, cardiovascular or cardiac.The current applications of radiomics in cardiac CT were found to mainly involve research into coronary plaques, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), myocardial tissue, and intracardiac lesions. Related findings on cardiac CT radiomics suggested the technique can assist the identification of vulnerable plaques or patients, improve cardiac risk prediction and stratification, discriminate myocardial pathology and etiologies behind intracardiac lesions, and offer new perspective and development prospects to personalized cardiovascular medicine.Cardiac CT radiomics can gather additional disease-related information at a microstructural level and establish a link between imaging phenotyping and tissue pathology or biology alone. Therefore, cardiac CT radiomics has significant clinical implications, including a contribution to clinical decision-making. Along with advancements in cardiac CT imaging, cardiac CT radiomics is expected to provide more precise phenotyping of cardiovascular disease for patients and doctors, which can improve diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic decision making in the future.","Jin Shang,Jin Shang,Yan Guo,Yan Guo,Yue Ma,Yue Ma,Yang Hou,Yang Hou",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,

10.1038/s41598-022-13379-8,,,Radiomics-based machine learning models to distinguish between metastatic and healthy bone using lesion-center-based geometric regions of interest,"Abstract Radiomics-based machine learning classifiers have shown potential for detecting bone metastases (BM) and for evaluating BM response to radiotherapy (RT). However, current radiomics models require large datasets of images with expert-segmented 3D regions of interest (ROIs). Full ROI segmentation is time consuming and oncologists often outline just RT treatment fields in clinical practice. This presents a challenge for real-world radiomics research. As such, a method that simplifies BM identification but does not compromise the power of radiomics is needed. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of radiomics models for BM detection using lesion-center-based geometric ROIs. The planning-CT images of 170 patients with non-metastatic lung cancer and 189 patients with spinal BM were used. The point locations of 631 BM and 674 healthy bone (HB) regions were identified by experts. ROIs with various geometric shapes were centered and automatically delineated on the identified locations, and 107 radiomics features were extracted. Various feature selection methods and machine learning classifiers were evaluated. Our point-based radiomics pipeline was successful in differentiating BM from HB. Lesion-center-based segmentation approach greatly simplifies the process of preparing images for use in radiomics studies and avoids the bottleneck of full ROI segmentation.","Hossein Naseri,Hossein Naseri,Sonia Skamene,M.

Purpose To develop and validate an MRI-based radiomics nomogram for individual diagnosis of OAL vs. IOI. Study Type Retrospective. Population A total of 103 patients (46.6% female) with mean age of 56.4 ± 16.3 years having OAL (n = 58) or IOI (n = 45) were divided into an independent training (n = 82) and a testing dataset (n = 21). Field Strength/Sequence A 3-T, precontrast T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and postcontrast T1WI (T1 + C). Assessment Radiomics features were extracted and selected from segmented tumors and peritumoral regions in MRI before-and-after filtering. These features, alone or combined with clinical characteristics, were used to construct a radiomics or joint signature to differentiate OAL from IOI, respectively. A joint nomogram was built to show the impact of the radiomics signature and clinical characteristics on individual risk of developing OAL. Statistical Tests Area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy (ACC) were used for performance evaluation. Mann–Whitney U and Chi-square tests were used to analyze continuous and categorical variables. Decision curve analysis, kappa statistics, DeLong and Hosmer–Lemeshow tests were also conducted. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The joint signature achieved an AUC of 0.833 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.806–0.870), slightly better than the radiomics signature with an AUC of 0.806 (95% CI: 0.767–0.838) (P = 0.778). The joint and radiomics signatures were comparable to experienced radiologists referencing to clinical characteristics (ACC = 0.810 vs. 0.796–0.806, P > 0.05) or not (AUC = 0.806 vs. 0.753–0.791, P > 0.05), respectively. The joint nomogram gained more net benefits than the radiomics nomogram, despite both showing good calibration and discriminatory efficiency (P > 0.05).

10.1002/mp.15853,35838056.0,,A multi‐modality physical phantom for mimicking tumor heterogeneity patterns in PET/CT and PET/MRI,"Background Hybrid imaging (e.g., positron emission tomography [PET]/computed tomography [CT], PET/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) helps one to visualize and quantify morphological and physiological tumor characteristics in a single study. The noninvasive characterization of tumor heterogeneity is essential for grading, treatment planning, and following-up oncological patients. However, conventional (CONV) image-based parameters, such as tumor diameter, tumor volume, and radiotracer activity uptake, are insufficient to describe tumor heterogeneities. Here, radiomics shows promise for a better characterization of tumors. Nevertheless, the validation of such methods demands imaging objects capable of reflecting heterogeneities in multi-modality imaging. We propose a phantom to simulate tumor heterogeneity repeatably in PET, CT, and MRI. Methods The phantom consists of three 50-ml plastic tubes filled partially with acrylic spheres of S1: 1.6 mm, S2: 50%(1.6 mm)/50%(6.3 mm), or S3: 6.3-mm diameter. The spheres were fixed to the bottom of each tube by a plastic grid, yielding one sphere free homogeneous region and one heterogeneous (S1, S2, or S3) region per tube. A 3-tube phantom and its replica were filled with a fluorodeoxyglucose (18F) solution for test–retest measurements in a PET/CT Siemens TPTV and a PET/MR Siemens Biograph mMR system. A number of 42 radiomic features (10 first order and 32 texture features) were calculated for each phantom region and imaging modality. Radiomic features stability was evaluated through coefficients of variation (COV) across phantoms and scans for PET, CT, and MRI. Further, the Wilcoxon test was used to assess the capability of stable features to discriminate the simulated phantom regions. Results The different patterns (S1–S3) did present visible heterogeneity in all imaging modalities. However, only for CT and MRI, a clear visual difference was present between the different patterns. Across all phantom regions in PET, CT, and MR images, 10, 16, and 21 features out of 42 evaluated features in total had a COV of 10% or less. In particular, CONV, histogram, and gray-level run length matrix features showed high repeatability for all the phantom regions and imaging modalities. Several of repeatable texture features allowed the image-based discrimination of the different phantom regions (p < 0.05). However, depending on the feature, different pattern discrimination capabilities were found for the different imaging modalities. Conclusion The proposed phantom appears suitable for simulating heterogeneities in PET, CT, and MRI. We demonstrate that it is possible to select radiomic features for the readout of the phantom. Most of these features had been shown to be relevant in previous clinical studies.","Alejandra Valladares,Alejandra Valladares,Thomas Beyer,Thomas Beyer,Laszlo Papp,László Papp,Elisabeth Salomon,Elisabeth Salomon,Ivo Rausch,Ivo Rausch",Medical Physics,2022.0
10.1007/s00330-022-08922-0,35904618.0,,A systematic review of prognosis predictive role of radiomics in pancreatic cancer: heterogeneity markers or statistical tricks?,"We aimed to systematically evaluate the prognostic prediction accuracy of radiomics features extracted from pre-treatment imaging in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Radiomics literature on overall survival (OS) prediction of PDAC were all included in this systematic review. A further meta-analysis was performed on the effect size of first-order entropy. Methodological quality and risk of bias of the included studies were assessed by the radiomics quality score (RQS) and prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST).Twenty-three studies were finally identified in this review. Two (8.7%) studies compared prognosis prediction ability between radiomics model and TNM staging model by C-index, and both showed a better performance of the radiomics. Twenty-one (91.3%) studies reported significant predictive values of radiomics features. Nine (39.1%) studies were included in the meta-analysis, and it showed a significant correlation between first-order entropy and OS (HR 1.66, 95%CI 1.18-2.34). RQS assessment revealed validation was only performed in 5 (21.7%) studies on internal datasets and 2 (8.7%) studies on external datasets. PROBAST showed that 22 (95.7%) studies have a high risk of bias in participants because of the retrospective study design.First-order entropy was significantly associated with OS and might improve the accuracy of PDAC prognosis prediction. Existing studies were poorly validated, and it should be noted in future studies. Modification of PROBAST for radiomics studies is necessary since the strict requirements of prospective study design may not be applicable to the demand for a large sample size in the model construction stage.• Radiomics based on the primary lesion holds great potential for prognosis prediction. First-order entropy was significantly associated with the overall survival of PDAC and might improve the accuracy of current PDAC prognosis prediction. • We strongly recommend that at least an internal validation should be conducted in any radiomics study. Attention should be paid to the complex relationships between radiomics features. • Due to the close relationship between radiomics and big data, the strict requirement of prospective study design in PROABST may not be appropriate for radiomics studies. A balance between study types and sample sizes for radiomics studies needs to be found in the model construction stage.","Yuhan Gao,Yuhan Gao,Sihang Cheng,Sihang Cheng,Liang Zhu,Liang Zhu,Qin Wang,Qin Wang,Wenyi Deng,Wenyi Deng,Zhaoyong Sun,Hansong Sun,Shitian Wang,Shitian Wang,Huadan Xue,Huadan Xue",European Radiology,2022.0
10.3389/fonc.2022.969907,36033433.0,,An automated approach for predicting glioma grade and survival of LGG patients using CNN and radiomics,"Objectives To develop and validate an efficient and automatically computational approach for stratifying glioma grades and predicting survival of lower-grade glioma (LGG) patients using an integration of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) and radiomics. Method This retrospective study reviewed 470 preoperative MR images of glioma from BraTs public dataset (n=269) and Jinling hospital (n=201). A fully automated pipeline incorporating tumor segmentation and grading was developed, which can avoid variability and subjectivity of manual segmentations. First, an integrated approach by fusing CNN features and radiomics features was employed to stratify glioma grades. Then, a deep-radiomics signature based on the integrated approach for predicting survival of LGG patients was developed and subsequently validated in an independent cohort. Results The performance of tumor segmentation achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.81. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of the radiomics features between the segmentation network and physicians were all over 0.75. The performance of glioma grading based on integrated approach achieved the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.958, showing the effectiveness of the integrated approach. The multivariable Cox regression results demonstrated that the deep-radiomics signature remained an independent prognostic factor and the integrated nomogram showed significantly better performance than the clinical nomogram in predicting overall survival of LGG patients (C-index: 0.865 vs. 0.796, P =0.005). Conclusion The proposed integrated approach can be noninvasively and efficiently applied in prediction of gliomas grade and survival. Moreover, our fully automated pipeline successfully achieved computerized segmentation instead of manual segmentation, which shows the potential to be a reproducible approach in clinical practice.","Chenan Xu,Chenan Xu,Yuanyuan Peng,Yuanyuan Peng,Weifang Zhu,Weifang Zhu,Zhongyue Chen,Zhongyue Chen,Jianrui Li,Jianrui Li,Wenhao Tan,Wenhao Tan,Zhiqiang Zhang,Zhiqiang Zhang,Xinjian Chen,Xinjian Chen",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0

Methods PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data were searched to identify articles on osteosarcoma radiomics until May 15, 2022. The studies were assessed by Radiomics Quality Score (RQS), Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement, Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM), and modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. The evidence supporting radiomics application for osteosarcoma was rated according to meta-analysis results. Results Twenty-nine articles were included. The average of the ideal percentage of RQS, the TRIPOD adherence rate and the CLAIM adherence rate were 29.2%, 59.2%, and 63.7%, respectively. RQS identified a radiomics-specific issue of phantom study. TRIPOD addressed deficiency in blindness of assessment. CLAIM and TRIPOD both pointed out shortness in missing data handling and sample size or power calculation. CLAIM identified extra disadvantages in data de-identification and failure analysis. External validation and open science were emphasized by all the above three tools. The risk of bias and applicability concerns were mainly related to the index test. The meta-analysis of radiomics predicting neoadjuvant chemotherapy response by MRI presented a diagnostic odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 28.83 (10.27–80.95) on testing datasets and was rated as weak evidence. Conclusions The quality of osteosarcoma radiomics studies is insufficient. More investigation is needed before using radiomics to optimize osteosarcoma treatment. CLAIM is recommended to guide the design and reporting of radiomics research.","Jingyu Zhong,Jingyu Zhong,Yangfan Hu,Yangfan Hu,Guangcheng Zhang,Guangcheng Zhang,Yue Xing,Yue Xing,Defang Ding,Defang Ding,Xiang Ge,Xiang Ge,Xiang Ge,Zhen Pan,Pan Zhang,Qingcheng Yang,Qingcheng Yang,Qian Yin,Qian Yin,Huizhen Zhang,Huizhen Zhang,Huan Zhang,Weiwu Yao,Weiwu Yao",Insights Into Imaging,2022.0

In particular, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data used in brain oncology are often heterogeneous in terms of scanners and acquisitions, which significantly impact quantitative radiomic features. Various methods have been proposed to decrease dependency, including methods acting directly on MR images, i.e., based on the application of several preprocessing steps before feature extraction or the ComBat method, which harmonizes radiomic features themselves. The ComBat method used for radiomics may be misleading and presents some limitations, such as the need to know the labels associated with the ""batch effect"". In addition, a statistically representative sample is required and the applicability of a signature whose batch label is not present in the train set is not possible. This work aimed to compare a priori and a posteriori radiomic harmonization methods and propose a code adaptation to be machine learning compatible. Furthermore, we have developed AutoComBat, which aims to automatically determine the batch labels, using either MRI metadata or quality metrics as inputs of the proposed constrained clustering. A heterogeneous dataset consisting of high and low-grade gliomas coming from eight different centers was considered. The different methods were compared based on their ability to decrease relative standard deviation of radiomic features extracted from white matter and on their performance on a classification task using different machine learning models. ComBat and AutoComBat using image-derived quality metrics as inputs for batch assignment and preprocessing methods presented promising results on white matter harmonization, but with no clear consensus for all MR images. Preprocessing showed the best results on the T1w-gd images for the grading task. For T2w-flair, AutoComBat, using either metadata plus quality metrics or metadata alone as inputs, performs better than the conventional ComBat, highlighting its potential for data harmonization. Our results are MRI weighting, feature class and task dependent and require further investigations on other datasets.","Alexandre Carré,Alexandre Carré,Enzo Battistella,Enzo Battistella,Stephane Niyoteka,S.

10.4048/jbc.2022.25.e35,,,Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Patients With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer: A Review,"Despite the high sensitivity and widespread use of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the American Cancer Society and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines do not recommend the routine use of preoperative MRI owing to the conflicting results and lack of clear benefit to the surgical outcome (reoperation and mastectomy) and long-term clinical outcomes (local recurrence and metachronous contralateral breast cancer). Preoperative MRI detects additional cancers that are occult at mammography and ultrasound but increases the rate of mastectomy. Concerns about overdiagnosis and overtreatment of preoperative MRI might be mitigated by adjusting the confounding factors when conducting studies, using the state-of-the-art image-guided biopsy technique, applying the radiologists' cumulative experiences in interpreting MRI findings, and performing multiple lumpectomies in patients with multicentric cancer. Among the various imaging methods, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI has the highest accuracy in predicting pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Prospective trials aimed at applying the MRI information to the de-escalation of surgical or radiation treatments are underway. In this review, current studies on the clinical outcomes of preoperative breast MRI are updated, and circumstances in which MRI may be useful for surgical planning are discussed.","Soo-Yeon Kim,Soo Yeon Kim,Nariya Cho,Nariya Cho",Journal of Breast Cancer,2022.0

Patients were divided into good and poor groups based on postoperative DSA. CTP parameters, such as mean transit time (MTT), time to drain (TTD), time to maximal plasma concentration (Tmax), and flow extraction product (FE), were obtained. CTP efficacy in evaluating surgical treatment were compared between the good and poor groups. The changes in the relative CTP parameters (ΔrMTT, ΔrTTD, ΔrTmax, and ΔrFE) were calculated to evaluate the differences between pre- and postoperative CTP values. CTP parameters were selected to build delta-radiomics models for identifying collateral vessel formation. The identification performance of machine learning classifiers was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).Of the 53 patients, 36 (67.9%) and 17 (32.1%) were divided into the good and poor groups, respectively. The postoperative changes of ΔrMTT, ΔrTTD, ΔrTmax, and ΔrFE in the good group were significantly better than the poor group (p < 0.05). Among all CTP parameters in the perfusion improvement evaluation, the ΔrTTD had the largest AUC (0.873). Eleven features were selected from the TTD parameter to build the delta-radiomics model. The classifiers of the support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors showed good diagnostic performance with AUC values of 0.933 and 0.867, respectively.The TTD-based delta-radiomics model has the potential to identify collateral vessel formation after the operation.","Jizhen Li,Jizhen Li,Yan Zhang,Yan Zhang,Di Yin,Di Yin,Hui Shang,Hui Shang,Kejian Li,Kejian Li,Tianyu Jiao,Tianyu Jiao,Caiyun Fang,Caiyun Fang,Yi Cui,Yi Cui,Ming Liu,Ming Liu,Jun Pan,Jun Pan,Qingshi Zeng,Qingshi Zeng",Frontiers in Neuroscience,2022.0

They differ in prognosis, with ChRCC capable of progressing and metastasizing, but RO is benign. This means discrimination of the two tumors is of crucial importance. Objectives: The purpose of this research was to develop and comprehensively evaluate predictive models that can discriminate between ChRCC and RO tumors using Computed Tomography (CT) scans and ML-Radiomics texture analysis methods. Methods: Data were obtained from 78 pathologically confirmed renal masses, scanned at two institutions. Data from the two institutions were combined to form a third set resulting in three data cohorts, i.e., cohort 1, 2 and combined. Contrast-enhanced scans were used and the axial cross-sectional slices of each tumor were extracted from the 3D data using a semi-automatic segmentation technique for both 2D and 3D scans. Radiomics features were extracted before and after applying filters and the dimensions of the radiomic features reduced using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was applied to avoid class imbalance. Five ML algorithms were used to train models for predictive classification and evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Results: The number of selected features with good model performance was 20, 40 and 6 for cohorts 1, 2 and combined, respectively. The best model performance in cohorts 1, 2 and combined had an excellent Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 1.00 ± 0.000, 1.00 ± 0.000 and 0.87 ± 0.073, respectively. Conclusions: ML-based radiomics signatures are potentially useful for distinguishing ChRCC and RO tumors, with a reliable level of performance for both 2D and 3D scanning.","Abeer J.

Imaging-based biomarkers have attracted much attention in anticancer therapy. This study aims to use the machine learning method to distinguish EGFR mutation status and further explores the predictive role of EGFR mutation-related radiomics features in response to first-line TKIs. Methods We retrospectively analyzed pretreatment CT images and clinical information from a cohort of lung adenocarcinomas. We entered the top-ranked features into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to establish a radiomics signature that predicted EGFR mutation status. Furthermore, we identified the best response-related features based on EGFR mutant-related features in first-line TKI therapy patients. Then we test and validate the predictive effect of the best response-related features for progression-free survival (PFS). Results Six hundred ninety-two patients were enrolled in building radiomics signatures. The 13 top-ranked features were input into an SVM classifier to establish the radiomics signature of the training cohort (n = 514), and the predictive score of the radiomics signature was assessed on an independent validation group with 178 patients and obtained an area under the curve (AUC) of 74.13%, an F1 score of 68.29%, a specificity of 79.55%, an accuracy of 70.79%, and a sensitivity of 62.22%. More importantly, the skewness-Low (≤0.882) or 10th percentile-Low group (≤21.132) had a superior partial response (PR) rate than the skewness-High or 10th percentile-High group ( p &amp;lt; 0.01). Higher skewness (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.722, p = 0.001) was also found to be significantly associated with worse PFS. Conclusions The radiomics signature can be used to predict EGFR mutation status. Skewness may contribute to the stratification of disease progression in lung cancer patients treated with first-line TKIs.","Meilin Jiang,Meilin Jiang,Pei Yang,Pei Yang,Jing Li,Jing Li,Wenying Peng,Wenying Peng,Xingxiang Pu,Xingxiang Pu,Bolin Chen,Bolin Chen,Jia Li,Jia Li,Jingyi Wang,Jingyi Wang,Lin Wu,Lin Wu",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0
10.1002/mp.15904,35917213.0,,Development and verification of radiomics framework for computed tomography image segmentation,"Background Radiomics has been considered an imaging marker for capturing quantitative image information (QII). The introduction of radiomics to image segmentation is desirable but challenging. Purpose This study aims to develop and validate a radiomics-based framework for image segmentation (RFIS). Methods RFIS is designed using features extracted from volume (svfeatures) created by sliding window (swvolume). The 53 svfeatures are extracted from 11 phantom series. Outliers in the svfeature datasets are detected by isolation forest (iForest) and specified as the mean value. The percentage coefficient of variation (%COV) is calculated to evaluate the reproducibility of svfeatures. RFIS is constructed and applied to the gross target volume (GTV) segmentation from the peritumoral region (GTV with a 10 mm margin) to assess its feasibility. The 127 lung cancer images are enrolled. The test-retest method, correlation matrix, and Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.05) are used to select non-redundant svfeatures of statistical significance from the reproducible svfeatures. The synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is utilized to balance the minority group in the training sets. The support vector machine (SVM) is employed for RFIS construction, which is tuned in the training set using ten-fold stratified cross-validation and then evaluated in the test sets. The swvolumes with the consistent classification results are grouped and merged. Mode filtering is performed to remove very small subvolumes and create relatively large regions of completely uniform character. In addition, RFIS performance is evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Results 30249 phantom and 145008 patient image swvolumes were analyzed. 49 (92.45% of 53) svfeatures represented excellent reproducibility(%COV<15). 45 features (91.84% of 49) included five categories that passed test-retest analysis. 13 svfeatures (28.89% of 45) svfeatures were selected for RFIS construction. RFIS showed an average (95% confidence interval) sensitivity of 0.848(95% CI:0.844-0.883), a specificity of 0.821(95% CI: 0.818-0.825), an accuracy of 83.48% (95% CI: 83.27%-83.70%), and an AUC of 0.906 (95% CI: 0.904-0.908) with cross-validation. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and AUC were equal to 0.762(95% CI: 0.754-0.770), 0.840(95% CI: 0.837-0.844), 82.29% (95% CI: 81.90%-82.60%), and 0.877(95% CI: 0.873-0.881) in the test set, respectively. GTV was segmented by grouping and merging swvolume with identical classification results. The mean DSC after mode filtering was 0.707±0.093 in the training sets and 0.688±0.072 in the test sets. Conclusion Reproducible svfeatures can capture the differences in QII among swvolumes. RFIS can be applied to swvolume classification, which achieves image segmentation by grouping and merging the swvolume with similar QII. This article is protected by copyright.

10.21037/jgo-22-548,,,"Development of a novel combined nomogram model integrating Rad-score, age and ECOG to predict the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization","Liver cancer is affecting more and more people's health. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) has become a routine treatment option, but the prognosis of patients is not optimistic. Effectively prediction of prognosis can provide clinicians with an objective basis for patient prognosis and timely adjustment of treatment strategies, thus improving the quality of patient survival. However, the current prediction methods have some limitations. Therefore, this study aims to develop a radiomics nomogram for predicting survival after TACE in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Seventy advanced HCC patients treated with TACE were enrolled from January 2013 to July 2019. Clinical information included age, sex, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score. Overall survival (OS) was confirmed by postoperative follow-up. Radiomics features were extracted using 3D Slicer (version 4.11.20210226) software, then obtain radiomics signature and calculate radiomics score (Rad-score) for each patient. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression were used to analyze the baseline clinical data of patients and establish clinical models. The obtained radiomics signature was incorporated into the clinical model to establish the radiomics nomogram. The predictive performance and calibration ability of the model were assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), C-index, and calibration curve.Three significant features were selected from 851 radiomics features by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model to construct the radiomics signature, and were significantly correlated with overall survival (P<0.001). Rad-score, age, and ECOG score were combined to construct a radiomics nomogram. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the radiomics nomogram were 0.801 (95% CI: 0.693-0.909), 0.822 (95% CI: 0.674-0.915), and 0.720 (95% CI: 0.674-0.915), respectively. The C-index of the radiomics nomogram was 0.700 (95% CI: 0.547-0.853). Calibration curves showed better agreement between the predicted and actual probabilities in the radiomics nomogram among the 3 features.The Rad-score was a strong risk predictor of survival after TACE for HCC patients. The radiomics nomogram might be improved the predictive efficacy of survival after TACE and it may also provide assistance to physicians in making treatment decisions.","Aiai Liu,Aiai Liu,Bo Liu,Bo Liu,Xiaodong Duan,Xidong Duan,Bo Yang,Bo Yang,Yiren Wang,Yiren Wang,Ping Dong,Ping Dong,Ping Zhou,Ping Zhou",Journal of gastrointestinal oncology,2022.0

Methods The data of patients with endometrial lesions from two centers were collected. The radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map, and late contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (LCE-T1WI). After data dimension reduction and feature selection, nine machine learning algorithms were conducted to determine which was the optimal radiomics model for differential diagnosis. The univariate analyses and logistic regression (LR) were performed to reduce valueless clinical parameters and to develop the clinical model. A nomogram using the radscores combined with clinical parameters was developed. Two integrated models were obtained respectively by the ensemble strategy and stacking algorithm based on the clinical model and optimal radiomics model. The area under the curve (AUC), clinical decisive curve (CDC), net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination index (IDI) were used to evaluate the performance and clinical benefits of the models. Results A total of 371 patients were incorporated. The LR model was the optimal radiomics model with the highest average AUC (0.854) and accuracy (0.802) in the internal and external validation groups (AUC = 0.910 and 0.798, respectively), and outperformed the clinical model (AUC = 0.739 and 0.592, respectively) or the radiologist (AUC = 0.768 and 0.628, respectively). The nomogram (AUC = 0.917 and 0.802, respectively) achieved better discrimination performance than the optimal radiomics model in two validation groups. The stacking model (AUC = 0.915) and ensemble model (AUC = 0.918) had a similar performance compared with the nomogram in the internal validation group, whereas the AUCs of the stacking model (AUC = 0.792) and ensemble model (AUC = 0.794) were lower than those of the nomogram and radiomics model in the external validation group. According to the CDC, NRI, and IDI, the optimal radiomics model, nomogram, stacking model, and ensemble model achieved good net benefits. Conclusions Multiparametric MRI-based radiomics models can non-invasively differentiate stage IA EC from benign endometrial lesions, and LR is the best machine learning algorithm. The nomogram presents excellent and stable diagnostic efficiency.","Qiu Bi,Qiu Bi,Yaoxin Wang,Yaoxin Wang,Yuchen Deng,Yuchen Deng,Yang Liu,Yang Liu,Yuanrui Pan,Yuanrui Pan,Yang Song,Yang Song,Yunzhu Wu,Yunzhu Wu,Kunhua Wu,Kunhua Wu",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0

Radiomics features were extracted from the enhanced CT (arterial phase) followed by dimensionality reduction. Clinical and CT features were combined to establish a prediction model. A radiomics nomogram was constructed by combining RadScore and clinical factors. Moreover, an independent dataset of 31 patients from a third hospital was employed to test the model. Thus, the performance of the nomogram, radiomics signature, and clinical models was evaluated on the training, validation, and the independent testing datasets. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the performance, and decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the model. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 15 radiomics features were selected from CT data as the imaging markers to generate RadScores, and demographics or clinical data like age, sex, and smoking factors combined with RadScores were used to distinguish PAs and WTs based on multivariate logistic regression analyses. The results showed that radiomics nomograms combining clinical factors and RadScores provided satisfactory predictive values for distinguishing PAs from WTs, with areas under ROC curves (AUC) of 0.979, 0.922, and 0.903 for the training, validation, and the independent testing datasets, respectively. Decision curve analysis revealed that the radiomics nomogram outperformed the clinical factor models in terms of accuracy and effectiveness. <h3>Conclusion</h3> CT-based radiomics nomograms combining RadScores and clinical factors can be used to identify PAs and WTs, which may help tumor management by clinicians.","Bo Feng,Baomin Feng,Zhou Wang,Zhou Wang,Jingjing Cui,Jingjing Cui,Jiacun Li,Jiacun Li,Xu Han,Han Xu,Dexin Yu,Dexin Yu,Qingshi Zeng,Qingshi Zeng,Jianjun Xiu,Jianjun Xiu",Academic Radiology,2022.0

However, many cancer patients have a poor prognosis even when they undergo radical excision at an early stage. Micrometastasis is one of the most critical factors that induced this situation. Undetected micrometastasis can lead to the failure of initial treatment. Therefore, preoperative and intraoperative detection of micrometastasis could have a significant clinical influence on the prognosis and optimal therapy for cancer patients. Additionally, to achieve this goal, researchers have aimed to create more effective detection technologies. Herein, we classify the currently reported micrometastasis detection technologies, introduce some representative samples for each technology, including the limitations, and provide future directions to overcome the limitations.","Xuqing Mao,Xuqing Mao,Ruyi Mei,Ruyi Mei,Shu-Xian Yu,Shuxian Yu,Lan Shou,Lan Shou,Wenzheng Zhang,Weijia Zhang,Keshuai Li,Keshuai Li,Zejing Qiu,Zejing Qiu,Tian Xie,Tian Xie,Xinbing Sui,Xinbing Sui",Technology in Cancer Research & Treatment,2022.0

Modern medical care and imaging technology are increasingly inseparable. However, the current diagnosis pattern of Signal-to-Image-to-Knowledge inevitably leads to information distortion and noise introduction in the procedure of image reconstruction (Signal-to-Image). Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that can mine knowledge from vast amounts of data offer opportunities to disrupt established workflows. In this prospective study, for the first time, we developed an AI-based Signal-to-Knowledge diagnostic scheme for lung nodule classification directly from the CT rawdata (the signal). We found that the rawdata achieved almost comparable performance with CT indicating that we can diagnose diseases without reconstructing images. Meanwhile, the introduction of rawdata could greatly promote the performance of CT, demonstrating that rawdata contains some diagnostic information that CT does not have. Our results break new ground and demonstrate the potential for direct Signal-to-Knowledge domain analysis.","Bingxi He,Bing He,Yu Guo,Yu Guo,Yongbei Zhu,Yongbei Zhu,Lixia Tong,Lixia Tong,Boyu Kong,Boyu Kong,Kun Wang,Kun Wang,Chao Sun,Caixia Sun,Hailin Li,Hailin Li,Feng Huang,Feng Huang,Liwei Wu,Liwei Wu,Meng Wang,Meng Wang,Fanyang Meng,Fanyang Meng,Le Dou,Le Dou,Kai Sun,Kai Sun,Tong Tong,Tong Tong,Zhenyu Liu,Zhenyu Liu,Ziqi Wei,Ziqi Wei,Wei Mu,Wei Mu,Shuo Wang,Shuo Wang,Zhenchao Tang,Zhenchao Tang,Shuaitong Zhang,Shuaitong Zhang,Jingwei Wei,Jingwei Wei,Lizhi Shao,Lizhi Shao,Mengjie Fang,Minghao Fang,JunTao Li,Juntao Li,Shouping Zhu,Sencun Zhu,Lili Zhou,Lili Zhou,Shuo Wang,Di Dong,Di Dong,Huimao Zhang,Huimao Zhang,Jie Tian,Hui Hui",,2022.0

This systematic review aims to provide an overview of the available evidence of radiomics for clinical outcome measures in GEP-NETs, to understand which applications hold the most promise and which areas lack evidence.MethodsPubMed, Embase, and Wiley/Cochrane Library databases were searched and a forward and backward reference check of the identified studies was executed. Inclusion criteria were (1) patients with GEP-NETs and (2) radiomics analysis on CT, MRI or PET. Two reviewers independently agreed on eligibility and assessed methodological quality with the radiomics quality score (RQS) and extracted outcome data.ResultsIn total, 1364 unique studies were identified and 45 were included for analysis. Most studies focused on GEP-NET grade and differential diagnosis of GEP-NETs from other neoplasms, while only a minority analysed treatment response or long-term outcomes. Several studies were able to predict tumour grade or to differentiate GEP-NETs from other lesions with a good performance (AUCs 0.74–0.96 and AUCs 0.80–0.99, respectively). Only one study developed a model to predict recurrence in pancreas NETs (AUC 0.77). The included studies reached a mean RQS of 18%.ConclusionAlthough radiomics for GEP-NETs is still a relatively new area, some promising models have been developed. Future research should focus on developing robust models for clinically relevant aims such as prediction of response or long-term outcome in GEP-NET, since evidence for these aims is still scarce.Key Points • The majority of radiomics studies in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours is of low quality. • Most evidence for radiomics is available for the identification of tumour grade or differentiation of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours from other neoplasms. • Radiomics for the prediction of response or long-term outcome in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours warrants further research.","Femke C.

Methods 138 glioma patients were retrospectively analyzed. MITK software was used to obtain the peritumoral area 5mm, 10mm, and 20mm from the tumor edge and extract texture features. The texture features were screened and the radiomics model was established, the radiomic score was calculated. A clinical prediction model and a combined prediction model along with Rad-score and clinical risk factors were established. The combined prediction model was displayed as a nomogram, and the predictive performance of the model for survival in glioma patients were evaluated. Results In the validation set, the C-index value of the radiomics model based on the peritumoral region 10mm away from the tumor edge based on T2WI images was 0.663 (95%CI=0.72-0.78), resulting in the best prediction performance. On the training set and validation set, the C-index of the nomogram was 0.770 and 0.730, respectively, indicating that the prediction performance of nomogram was better than those of the radiomics model and clinical pathological model. The model had the best prediction effect on the 3-year survival rate of glioma patients. Conclusion The combined prediction model based on the preoperative T2WI images in the peritumoral region 10mm from the tumor edge and the clinicopathological risk factors can accurately predict the prognosis of glioma, providing the best effect of prediction on the 3-year survival rate of glioma.","Qiuyang Hou,Qiuyang Hou,Chengkun Ye,Chengkun Ye,Chang Liu,Chang Liu,Jiang hao 邢,Jiang hao 邢,Yaqiong Ge,Yubin Ge,Kexue Deng,Kan Deng",,2022.0

However, how different hippocampal segmentation methods affect HRFs in AD is still unknown. The aim of the study was to investigate how different segmentation methods affect HRF accuracy in AD analysis.A total of 1650 subjects were identified from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI). The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS-cog13) were also adopted. After calculating the HRFs of intensity, shape, and textural features from each side of the hippocampus in structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), the consistency of HRFs calculated from 7 different hippocampal segmentation methods was validated, and the performance of machine learning-based classification of AD vs. normal control (NC) adopting the different HRFs was also examined. Additional 571 subjects from the European DTI Study on Dementia database (EDSD) were to validate the consistency of results.Between different segmentations, HRFs showed a high measurement consistency (R > 0.7), a high significant consistency between NC, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD (T-value plot, R > 0.8), and consistent significant correlations between HRFs and MMSE/ADAS-cog13 (p < 0.05). The best NC vs. AD classification was obtained when the hippocampus was sufficiently segmented by primitive majority voting (threshold = 0.2). High consistent results were reproduced from independent EDSD cohort.HRFs exhibited high consistency across different hippocampal segmentation methods, and the best performance in AD classification was obtained when HRFs were extracted by the naïve majority voting method with a more sufficient segmentation and relatively low hippocampus segmentation accuracy.• The hippocampal radiomic features exhibited high measurement/statistical/clinical consistency across different hippocampal segmentation methods. • The best performance in AD classification was obtained when hippocampal radiomics were extracted by the naïve majority voting method with a more sufficient segmentation and relatively low hippocampus segmentation accuracy.","Qian Zheng,Qiang Zheng,Yiyu Zhang,Yiyu Zhang,Honglun Li,Honglun Li,Xiangrong Tong,Xiangrong Tong,Minhui Ouyang,Minhui Ouyang",European Radiology,2022.0

With the ever-increasing data on imaging characteristics of tumor subtypes and advancements in imaging techniques, it is now often possible for radiologists to differentiate tumor subtypes on imaging. Armed with this knowledge, radiologists may be able to provide specific information that can obviate the need for invasive methods to identify tumor subtypes. Different tumor subtypes also differ in their patterns of metastatic spread. Awareness of these differences can direct radiologists to relevant anatomical sites to screen for early metastases that may otherwise be difficult to detect during cursory inspection.

10.3390/app12168086,,,Machine Learning in Recognition of Basic Pulmonary Pathologies,"Nowadays, during the diagnosis process, the doctor is able to obtain access to much information describing the patient’s condition using appropriate tools. However, there are always two sides to the coin. The doctor has certain limitations regarding the amount of data they can process at once. Information technology comes to the rescue, which with the help of computers is able to quickly and effectively separate important information from redundant information and support the doctor in making a diagnosis. In this work, a decision-making system was created to diagnose common lung pathologies in digital radiography images. Here, we consider four basic pulmonary diseases: pneumothorax, pneumonia, pulmonary consolidation, and lung lesions. Our objective is to develop a new automatic detection method of lung pathologies on chest X-ray radiographs using python programming language and its libraries. The approach uses solutions in the field of artificial intelligence, such as deep learning, convolutional neural network and segmentation to make a diagnosis that aims to help the radiologist at work. In the first sections, this work describes the fundamentals of the present form of diagnosis, a proposal to improve this process, the method of operation of the algorithms used, data acquisition, segmentation and processing methods. Then, the results of the operation of four different models and their implementation in a practical window program were presented. The best model, which detects pulmonary consolidation, achieves accuracy higher than 91%, which is a satisfactory result because they are not intended to replace radiologists but to improve their work. In the future, this type of program can be further developed by adding models that recognize other conditions.","Jakub Płudowski,Jakub Płudowski,Jan J. Mulawka,Jan Mulawka",Applied sciences,2022.0

Radiomics features were extracted from the segmented cavitation. A radiomics model was constructed to predict MDR using a random forest classifier. Meaningful clinical characteristics and subjective CT findings comprised the clinical model. The radiomics and clinical models were combined to create a combined model. ROC curves were used to validate the capability of the models in the training and testing cohorts.Twenty-one radiomics features were selected as optimal predictors to build the model for predicting MDR-TB. The AUCs of the radiomics model were significantly higher than those of the clinical model in either the training cohort (0.844 versus 0.589, p < 0.05) or the testing cohort (0.829 versus 0.500, p < 0.05).

Methods After excluding subjects with incomplete data or other types of treatments, 272 (Dataset 1) and 43 (Dataset 2, external validation) NSCLC patients who were only treated with chemotherapy as the first-line treatment were enrolled between 2015 and 2019. All patients were divided into response and nonresponse based on the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors, version 1.1. By using 3D slicer and morphological operations in python, the intra- and peritumoral regions of lung tumors were segmented from pre-treatment CT images (unenhanced) and confirmed by two experienced radiologists. Then radiomic features (the first order, texture, shape, et al.) were extracted from the above regions of interest. The models were trained and tested in Dataset 1 and further validated in Dataset 2. The performance of models was compared using the area under curve (AUC), confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results The radiomic model using features from the peritumoral region of 0–3 mm outperformed that using features from 3–6, 6–9, 9–12 mm peritumoral region, and intratumoral region (AUC: 0.95 versus 0.87, 0.86, 0.85, and 0.88). By the fusion of features from 0–3 and 3–6 mm peritumoral regions, the logistic regression model achieved the best performance, with an AUC of 0.97.

Recent approaches that incorporate brain functional radiomic features and machine learning have shown potential for predicting certain phenotypes or disorders from functional magnetic resonance images. In this study, we aimed to predict the level of social anxiety in young adult participants by training machine learning models with resting-state brain functional radiomic features including the regional homogeneity, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, fractional resting-state physiological fluctuation amplitude, and degree centrality. Among the machine learning models, the XGBoost model achieved the best performance with balanced accuracy of 77.7% and F1 score of 0.815. Analysis of input feature importance demonstrated that the orbitofrontal cortex and the degree centrality were most relevant to predicting the level of social anxiety among the input brain regions and the input type of radiomic features, respectively. These results suggest potential validity for predicting social anxiety with machine learning of the resting-state brain functional radiomic features and provide further understanding of the neural basis of the symptom.","Byung-Hoon Kim,Byung–Hoon Kim,Min-Kyeong Kim,Min-Kyeong Kim,Hye-Jeong Jo,Hye-Jeong Jo,Jae-Jin Kim,Jae‐Jin Kim",Scientific Reports,2022.0
10.21203/rs.3.rs-1815132/v2,,,Prediction of distant metastasis in esophageal cancer using a radiomics-clinical model,"Abstract Background Distant metastasis, which occurs at a rate of 25% in patients with esophageal cancer (EC), has a poor prognosis, with previous studies reporting an overall survival of only 3–10 months. However, few studies have been conducted to predict distant metastasis in EC, owing to a dearth of reliable biomarkers. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an accurate model for predicting distant metastasis in patients with EC. Methods A total of 299 EC patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a training cohort (n = 207) and a validation cohort (n = 92). Logistic univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify clinical independent predictors and create a clinical nomogram. Radiomic features were extracted from contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images taken prior to treatment, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression was used to screen the associated features, which were then used to develop a radiomic signature. Based on the screened features, four machine learning algorithms were used to build radiomics models. The joint nomogram with radiomic signature and clinically independent risk factors was developed using the logical regression algorithm. All models were validated and compared by discrimination, calibration, reclassification, and clinical benefit. Results Multivariable analyses revealed that age, N stage, and degree of pathological differentiation were independent predictors of distant metastasis, and a clinical nomogram incorporating these factors was established. A radiomic signature was developped by a set of sixteen features chosen from 851 radiomic features. The joint nomogram incorporating clinical factors and radiomic signature performed better [AUC(95% CI): 0.827(0.742–0.912)] than the clinical nomogram [AUC(95% CI): 0.731(0.626–0.836)] and radiomics predictive models [AUC(95% CI): 0.754(0.652–0.855), LR algorithms]. Caliberation and decision curve analyses revealed that the radiomics-clinical nomogram outperformed the other models. In comparison to the clinical nomogram, the joint nomogram's NRI was 0.114 (95% CI: 0.075–0.345), and its IDI was 0.071 (95% CI: 0.030–0.112), P = 0.001. Conclusion We developed and validated the first radiomics-clinical nomogram for distant metastasis in EC which may aid clinicians in identifying patients at high risk of distant metastasis.","Chao Zhu,Chao Zhu,Fengchun Mu,Fengchun Mu,Songping Wang,Songping Wang,Qingtao Qiu,Qingtao Qiu,Shuai Wang,Shuai Wang,Linlin Wang,Linlin Wang",,2022.0
10.1007/s00261-022-03621-2,35913507.0,,Prediction of treatment response following ethanol sclerotherapy of renal cysts by computed tomography,"ObjectivesTo investigate predictive factors of treatment response following ethanol sclerotherapy of large renal cysts via computed tomography (CT).MethodsRetrospective study reviewed 71 patients (61.0 ± 13.2 years; M:F = 32:39) who underwent pretreatment CT and were treated with sclerotherapy of a large (> 5 cm) renal cyst (mean volume: 279.8 cc) using 99% ethanol from January 2010 to February 2019. Patients were followed up at least two times, short-term (defined as < 6 months, median 2.1 months) and long-term (defined as > 1 year, median 15.5 months), via ultrasound or CT. Suboptimal response was defined as the volume of residual cyst > 20 mL in each follow-up. Predictive variables of radiologic findings and radiomics features were analyzed using logistic regression analysis.ResultsSuboptimal response rates were 33.8% and 18.3% at short-term and long-term follow-ups, respectively. In radiologic findings, patients with suboptimal response in the short-term follow-up showed a more frequent estimated cyst volume ≥ 270 mL (OR 14.8, 95% CI 3.9–55.9, p < 0.001) and sinus protrusion (OR 7.0, 95% CI 1.7–28.5, p = 0.007). Cyst volume ≥ 270 mL was also associated with suboptimal response in the long-term follow-up (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.3–16.9, p = 0.021). When radiomics features were combined, the area under the curve increased from 0.83 to 0.86 and from 0.68 to 0.82 to predict suboptimal response in short-term and long-term follow-ups, respectively.ConclusionGreater estimated volume, sinus protrusion, and radiomics features of the cysts in pretreatment CT can help predict suboptimal response of renal cyst after sclerotherapy.Graphical abstract","Min Gwan Kim,Min Gwan Kim,Taek Min Kim,Taek Min Kim,Sang Youn Kim,Sang-Youn Kim,Jeong Yeon Cho,Jeong Yeon Cho",Abdominal Imaging,2022.0

Purpose To develop and validate clinical and radiomics models based on contrast-enhanced MRI for the preoperative diagnosis of DPHCC. Study type Retrospective. Population A total of 87 patients with DPHCC and 92 patients with non-DPHCC randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 125: 64 non-DPHCC; 61 DPHCC) and a validation cohort (n = 54: 28 non-DPHCC; 26 DPHCC). Field Strength/Sequence A 3.0 T; dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with time-resolved T1-weighted imaging sequence. Assessment In the clinical model, the maximum tumor diameter and hepatitis B virus (HBV) were independent risk factors of DPHCC. In the radiomics model, a total of 1781 radiomics features were extracted from tumor volumes of interest (VOIs) in the arterial phase (AP) and portal venous phase (PP) images. For feature reduction and selection, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and recursive feature elimination (RFE) were used. Clinical, AP, PP, and combined radiomics models were established using machine learning algorithms (support vector machine [SVM], logistic regression [LR], and logistic regression-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LR-LASSO]) and their discriminatory efficacy assessed and compared. Statistical Tests The independent sample t test, Mann–Whitney U test, Chi-square test, regression analysis, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, the Delong test. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results In the validation cohort, the combined radiomics model (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.908, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.831–0.985) showed the highest diagnostic performance. The AUCs of the PP (AUC = 0.879, 95% CI: 0.779–0.979) and combined radiomics models were significantly higher than that of clinical model (AUC = 0.685, 95% CI: 0.526–0.844). There were no significant differences in AUC between AP or PP radiomics model and combined radiomics model (P = 0.286, 0.180 and 0.543).

From 138 articles, 20 relevant original research articles were included. Studies were scored based on RQS and TRIPOD guidelines.Most included studies did not perform pre-processing; isovoxel resampling, signal intensity normalization, and N4 bias field correction were performed in only five (25%), eight (40%), and four (20%) studies, respectively. Only two (10%) studies performed external validation. The mean RQS and basic adherence rate were 2.8 (7.6%) and 26.6%, respectively. There was a low adherence rate for conducting comparison to ""gold-standard"" (20%), multiple segmentation (25%), and stating potential clinical utility (25%). No study stated the biological correlation, conducted a test-retest or phantom study, was a prospective study, conducted cost-effectiveness analysis, or provided open-source code and data, which resulted in low-level evidence. The overall adherence rate for TRIPOD was 54.6%, and it was low for reporting the title (5%), abstract (0%), explaining the sample size (10%), and suggesting a full prediction model (5%).The radiomics reporting quality for pituitary adenoma is insufficient. Pre-processing is required for feature reproducibility and external validation is necessary. Feature reproducibility, clinical utility demonstration, higher evidence levels, and open science are required. Titles, abstracts, and full prediction model suggestions should be improved for transparent reporting.Despite the rapidly increasing number of radiomics researches on pituitary adenoma, the quality of science in these researches is unknown. Our study indicates that the overall quality needs to be significantly improved in radiomics studies on pituitary adenoma, and since the concept of RQS and IBSI is still unfamiliar to clinicians and radiologist researchers, our study may help to reach higher technical and clinical impact in the future study.","So Yeon Won,So Yeon Won,Narae Lee,Mi Kyung Lee,Yae Won Park,Yae Won Park,Sung Soo Ahn,Sung Soo Ahn,Cheol Ryong Ku,Cheol Ryong Ku,Eui Hyun Kim,Eui Hyun Kim,Seung Koo Lee,Seung-Koo Lee",British Journal of Radiology,2022.0
10.3389/fonc.2022.943326,,,"Radiogenomics analysis reveals the associations of dynamic contrast-enhanced–MRI features with gene expression characteristics, PAM50 subtypes, and prognosis of breast cancer","Background To investigate reliable associations between dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) features and gene expression characteristics in breast cancer (BC) and to develop and validate classifiers for predicting PAM50 subtypes and prognosis from DCE-MRI non-invasively. Methods Two radiogenomics cohorts with paired DCE-MRI and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data were collected from local and public databases and divided into discovery ( n = 174) and validation cohorts ( n = 72). Six external datasets ( n = 1,443) were used for prognostic validation. Spatial–temporal features of DCE-MRI were extracted, normalized properly, and associated with gene expression to identify the imaging features that can indicate subtypes and prognosis. Results Expression of genes including RBP4, MYBL2, and LINC00993 correlated significantly with DCE-MRI features (q-value &amp;lt; 0.05). Importantly, genes in the cell cycle pathway exhibited a significant association with imaging features ( p -value &amp;lt; 0.001). With eight imaging-associated genes ( CHEK1 , TTK , CDC45 , BUB1B , PLK1 , E2F1 , CDC20 , and CDC25A ), we developed a radiogenomics prognostic signature that can distinguish BC outcomes in multiple datasets well. High expression of the signature indicated a poor prognosis ( p -values &amp;lt; 0.01). Based on DCE-MRI features, we established classifiers to predict BC clinical receptors, PAM50 subtypes, and prognostic gene sets. The imaging-based machine learning classifiers performed well in the independent dataset (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.8361, 0.809, 0.7742, and 0.7277 for estrogen receptor (ER), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched, basal-like, and obtained radiogenomics signature). Furthermore, we developed a prognostic model directly using DCE-MRI features ( p -value &amp;lt; 0.0001). Conclusions Our results identified the DCE-MRI features that are robust and associated with the gene expression in BC and displayed the possibility of using the features to predict clinical receptors and PAM50 subtypes and to indicate BC prognosis.","Wenlong Ming,Wenlong Ming,Yanhui Zhu,Yanhui Zhu,Yunfei Bai,Ya Mei Bai,Wanjun Gu,Wanjun Gu,Fuyu Li,Fuyu Li,Zixi Hu,Zixi Hu,Tiansong Xia,Tiansong Xia,Zuolei Dai,Zuolei Dai,Xiafei Yu,Xiafei Yu,Huamei Li,Huamei Li,Yu Gu,Yu Gu,Sheng Yuan,Shaoxun Yuan,Rongxin Zhang,Rongxin Zhang,Haitao Li,Haitao Li,Wenyong Zhu,Wenyong Zhu,Jingjin Ding,Jianing Ding,Xiao Sun,Xiao Sun,Yun Liu,Yun Liu,Hongde Liu,Hongde Liu,Xiaoan Liu,Xiaoan Li",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0

Standard uptake value (SUV) metrics and radiomics features were extracted for each lesion. Metabolic treatment response was determined according to PERCIST criteria in 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging performed 2 months after the treatment. Feature selection was done with recursive feature elimination (RFE). The association between selected features and treatment response was evaluated with logistic regression analysis.&#x0D; Results: Eventually, 13 lesions responded to TARE, while 12 lesions remain stable or progressed. All standard uptake values and 27 out of 30 textural heterogeneity indicators were significantly higher in lesions that responded to treatment. SUVmax, kurtosis and dissimilarity features were selected by the RFE algorithm for the prediction of response to TARE. Logistic regression analysis revealed that all three parameters were significantly associated with treatment outcome.&#x0D; Conclusion: Textural features extracted from pre-treatment F-18 FDG PET/CT in patients undergoing TARE due to liver tumors are promising biomarkers that can be potentially used to predict metabolic treatment response.","Nazim Coskun,Nazım Coşkun,Alptuğ Özer YÜKSEL>,Alptuğ Özer YÜKSEL,Murat Canyiğit,Murat CANYİĞİT,Elif Özdemir,Elif Özdemir",Journal of health sciences and medicine,2022.0
10.3748/wjg.v28.i31.4399,,,Radiomics and nomogram of magnetic resonance imaging for preoperative prediction of microvascular invasion in small hepatocellular carcinoma,"Microvascular invasion (MVI) of small hepatocellular carcinoma (sHCC) (≤ 3.0 cm) is an independent prognostic factor for poor progression-free and overall survival. Radiomics can help extract imaging information associated with tumor pathophysiology.To develop and validate radiomics scores and a nomogram of gadolinium ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for preoperative prediction of MVI in sHCC.In total, 415 patients were diagnosed with sHCC by postoperative pathology. A total of 221 patients were retrospectively included from our hospital. In addition, we recruited 94 and 100 participants as independent external validation sets from two other hospitals. Radiomics models of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) were constructed and validated using machine learning. As presented in the radiomics nomogram, a prediction model was developed using multivariable logistic regression analysis, which included radiomics scores, radiologic features, and clinical features, such as the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level. The calibration, decision-making curve, and clinical usefulness of the radiomics nomogram were analyzed. The radiomic nomogram was validated using independent external cohort data. The areas under the receiver operating curve (AUC) were used to assess the predictive capability.Pathological examination confirmed MVI in 64 (28.9%), 22 (23.4%), and 16 (16.0%) of the 221, 94, and 100 patients, respectively. AFP, tumor size, non-smooth tumor margin, incomplete capsule, and peritumoral hypointensity in hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images had poor diagnostic value for MVI of sHCC. Quantitative radiomic features (1409) of MRI scans) were extracted. The classifier of logistic regression (LR) was the best machine learning method, and the radiomics scores of HBP and DWI had great diagnostic efficiency for the prediction of MVI in both the testing set (hospital A) and validation set (hospital B, C). The AUC of HBP was 0.979, 0.970, and 0.803, respectively, and the AUC of DWI was 0.971, 0.816, and 0.801 (P < 0.05), respectively. Good calibration and discrimination of the radiomics and clinical combined nomogram model were exhibited in the testing and two external validation cohorts (C-index of HBP and DWI were 0.971, 0.912, 0.808, and 0.970, 0.843, 0.869, respectively). The clinical usefulness of the nomogram was further confirmed using decision curve analysis.AFP and conventional Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI features have poor diagnostic accuracies for MVI in patients with sHCC. Machine learning with an LR classifier yielded the best radiomics score for HBP and DWI. The radiomics nomogram developed as a noninvasive preoperative prediction method showed favorable predictive accuracy for evaluating MVI in sHCC.","Yi-Di Chen,Yidi Chen,Ling Zhang,Ling Zhang,Zhi-Peng Zhou,Zhipeng Zhou,Bin Lin,Bin Lin,Zijian Jiang,Zi-Jian Jiang,Cheng Tang,Cheng Tang,Yi‐Wu Dang,Yi-Wu Dang,Yuwei Xia,Yu-Wei Xia,Bin Song,Bin Song,Линг Лонг,Li-Ling Long",World Journal of Gastroenterology,2022.0

Over the years many different prediction methods were introduced where both non-ensemble and ensemble methods were proposed for the response prediction. These (non-)ensemble methods, although functioning well for numerous problems, are not always suitable. When considering a more challenging data set, they can fail for either both training and validation or validation alone. Since our interest lies in the use of the model for predicting the response of new patients, we needed to find a method that works good for both training and validation. We were interested in predicting the response grade of patients with colorectal cancer by examining their CT scans. From the medical images, we extracted radiomic features such that we obtained a quantitative features design. We predicted the Dworak response grade of the patients using the radiomics data. Our study showed that the classical prediction methods fail for this type of data. This is due to various problems we are facing in both the response parameter as well as the feature matrix. Even though radiomics are very promising, we showed that they are not yet ready to be given to doctors solely as a definitive prediction tool. We will need to construct a prediction method that is capable of learning from the radiomics data and adapting its algorithm to suit the characteristics of the data better.","Camille Raets,Camille Raets,Chaïmae El Aisati,Chaimae El Aisati,Mark De Ridder,Mark De Ridder,Kurt Barbé,Kurt Barbe",,2022.0

Patients and Methods One hundred fifty-one (151) patients with histologically confirmed gliomas and post-therapeutic progressive MRI findings according to the response assessment in neuro-oncology criteria underwent a dynamic amino acid PET scan using the tracer O-(2-[ 18 F]fluoroethyl)- l -tyrosine (FET). Thereof, 124 patients were investigated on a stand-alone PET scanner (data used for model development and validation), and 27 patients on a hybrid PET/MRI scanner (data used for model testing). Mean and maximum tumor to brain ratios (TBR mean , TBR max ) were calculated using the PET data from 20 to 40 min after tracer injection. Logistic regression models were evaluated for the FET PET parameters TBR mean , TBR max , and for radiomics features of the tumor areas as well as combinations thereof to differentiate between TP and TRC. The best performing models in the validation dataset were finally applied to the test dataset. The diagnostic performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results Thirty-seven patients (25%) were diagnosed with TRC, and 114 (75%) with TP. The logistic regression model comprising the conventional FET PET parameters TBR mean and TBR max resulted in an AUC of 0.78 in both the validation (sensitivity, 64%; specificity, 80%) and the test dataset (sensitivity, 64%; specificity, 80%). The model combining the conventional FET PET parameters and two radiomics features yielded the best diagnostic performance in the validation dataset (AUC, 0.92; sensitivity, 91%; specificity, 80%) and demonstrated its generalizability in the independent test dataset (AUC, 0.85; sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 70%). Conclusion The developed radiomics classifier allows the differentiation between TRC and TP in pretreated gliomas based on routinely acquired static FET PET scans with a high diagnostic accuracy.","Marguerite Müller,Markus Müller,Oliver Winz,Oliver Winz,Robin Gutsche,Robin Gutsche,Ralph T.H.

The purpose was to investigate whether radiomics based on T2-weighted MRI can discriminate between benign and borderline EOTs preoperatively.A total of 417 patients (309, 78, and 30 samples in the training and internal and external validation sets) with pathologically proven benign and borderline EOTs were included in this multicenter study. In total, 1130 radiomics features were extracted from manually delineated tumor volumes of interest on images. The following three different models were constructed and evaluated: radiomics features only (radiomics model); clinical and radiological characteristics only (clinic-radiological model); and a combination of them all (combined model). The diagnostic performances of models were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and area under the ROC curves (AUCs) were compared using the DeLong test.The best machine learning algorithm to distinguish borderline from benign EOTs was the logistic regression. The combined model achieved the best performance in discriminating between benign and borderline EOTs, with an AUC of 0.86 ± 0.07. The radiomics model showed a moderate AUC of 0.82 ± 0.07, outperforming the clinic-radiological model (AUC of 0.79 ± 0.06). In the external validation set, the combined model performed significantly better than the clinic-radiological model (AUCs of 0.86 vs. 0.63, p = 0.021 [DeLong test]).Radiomics, based on T2-weighted MRI, can provide critical diagnostic information for discriminating between benign and borderline EOTs, thus having the potential to aid personalized treatment options.","Mingxiang Wei,Mingxiang Wei,Yu Zhang,Yu Zhang,Genji Bai,Genji Bai,Chenyue Ding,Cong Ding,Haimin Xu,Haimin Xu,Yao Dai,Yao Dai,Shuangqing Chen,Shuang-Qing Chen,Hong Wang,Hong Wang",Insights Into Imaging,2022.0

Methods A total of 536 CC patients with confirmed histological characteristics and lymph node status after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy were enrolled. Radiomics features were extracted and selected with US images acquired with ATL HDI5000, Voluson E8, MyLab classC, ACUSON S2000, and HI VISION Preirus to build radiomics models for LNM prediction using support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression, respectively. Results There were 148 patients (training vs validation: 102:46) scanned in machine HDI5000, 75 patients (53:22) in machine Voluson E8, 100 patients (69:31) in machine MyLab classC, 110 patients (76:34) in machine ACUSON S2000, and 103 patients (73:30) in machine HI VISION Preirus, respectively. Few radiomics features were reproducible among different machines. The area under the curves (AUCs) ranged from 0.75 to 0.86, 0.73 to 0.86 in the training cohorts, and from 0.71 to 0.82, 0.70 to 0.80 in the validation cohorts for SVM and logistic regression models, respectively. The highest difference in AUCs for different machines reaches 17.8% and 15.5% in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Conclusions The performance of radiomics model is dependent on the type of scanner. The problem of scanner dependency on radiomics features should be considered, and their effects should be minimized in future studies for US images.","Jinling Yi,Yi Jin,Xiyao Lei,Xiyao Lei,Lei Zhang,Lei Zhang,Qiao Zheng,Qiao Zheng,Juebin Jin,Juebin Jin,Congying Xie,Congying Xie,Xiance Jin,Xiance Jin,Yao Ai,Yao Ai",Technology in Cancer Research & Treatment,2022.0

Methods The clinical and ultrasound data of 1000 female patients (500 pathologically benign patients, 500 pathologically malignant patients) who underwent breast ultrasound examinations at our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The cases were randomly divided into training and validation sets at a ratio of 7:3. Once the region of interest (ROI) of the lesion was manually contoured, Spearman's rank correlation, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and the Boruta algorithm were adopted to determine optimal features and establish a logistic regression classification model. The performance of the model was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and calibration and decision curves (DCA). Results Eight ultrasound radiomic features were selected to establish the model. The AUC values of the model were 0.979 and 0.977 in the training and validation sets, respectively (P = .0029), indicating good discriminative ability in both datasets. Additionally, the calibration and DCA suggested that the model's calibration efficiency and clinical application value were both superior. Conclusions The proposed logistic regression model based on 2D grayscale ultrasound images could facilitate differential diagnosis of benign and malignant breast nodules. The model, which was constructed using ultrasound radiomic features identified in this study, demonstrated good diagnostic performance and could be useful in helping clinicians formulate individualized treatment plans for patients.","Shanshan Shi,Shanshan Shi,Xin An,Xin An,Yuhong Li,Yuhong Li",Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine,2022.0
10.1109/memea54994.2022.9856571,,,Unraveling the biological meaning of radiomic features,"Radiomics has the potential of characterizing the tumor phenotype hidden in medical images, allowing us to get more out of medical images than the eyes can see and liberating us from only using lesion size as a tumor response criterion. The extracted radiomics features are typically used in machine learning models to predict tumor responses. However, the inherent non-biological-interpretability of the features strongly hinders their clinical application. Therefore, our group aims to discover the biological meaning of radiomics features by performing dedicated in vivo experiments. Here, as a proof of concept, the radiomics features extracted from the CT scans of three widely used and well-characterized murine tumor models (CT26, 4T1 and EMT6) were analyzed and compared using an exploratory factor analysis. The results suggest that the features were able to differentiate between the different tumor models.

10.3389/fonc.2022.899351,,,Prediction of 5-year progression-free survival in advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma with pretreatment PET/CT using multi-modality deep learning-based radiomics,"Objective: Deep Learning-based Radiomics (DLR) has achieved great success in medical image analysis and has been considered a replacement for conventional radiomics that relies on handcrafted features. In this study, we aimed to explore the capability of DLR for the prediction of 5-year Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) using pretreatment PET/CT. Methods: A total of 257 patients (170/87 in internal/external cohorts) with advanced NPC (TNM stage III or IVa) were enrolled. We developed an end-to-end multi-modality DLR model, in which a 3D convolutional neural network was optimized to extract deep features from pretreatment PET/CT images and predict the probability of 5-year PFS. TNM stage, as a high-level clinical feature, could be integrated into our DLR model to further improve the prognostic performance. To compare conventional radiomics and DLR, 1456 handcrafted features were extracted, and optimal conventional radiomics methods were selected from 54 cross-combinations of 6 feature selection methods and 9 classification methods. In addition, risk group stratification was performed with clinical signature, conventional radiomics signature, and DLR signature. Results: Our multi-modality DLR model using both PET and CT achieved higher prognostic performance than the optimal conventional radiomics method. Furthermore, the multi-modality DLR model outperformed single-modality DLR models using only PET or only CT. For risk group stratification, the conventional radiomics signature and DLR signature enabled significant differences between the high- and low-risk patient groups in both internal and external cohorts, while the clinical signature failed in the external cohort. Conclusion: Our study identified potential prognostic tools for survival prediction in advanced NPC, suggesting that DLR could provide complementary values to the current TNM staging.","Gu, Bingxin,Bingxin Gu,Mingyuan Meng,Meng, Mingyuan,Lei Bi,Bi, Lei,Jin Man Kim,Kim, Jinman,David Dagan Feng,Feng, David Dagan,Shaoli Song,Song, Shaoli",Frontiers in Oncology,2021.0

Materials and methods This retrospective study included 228 patients with surgically confirmed NSCLC (training set, 159 patients; testing set, 69 patients). ITKsnap3.8.0 was used for image(CT and PET images) segmentation, AK version 3.2.0 was used for radiomics feature extraction, and Python3.7.0 was used for radiomics feature screening. A radiomics model for predicting occult lymph node metastasis was established using a logistic regression algorithm. A nomogram was constructed by combining radiomics scores with selected clinical predictors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to verify the performance of the radiomics model and nomogram in the training and testing sets. Results The radiomics nomogram comprising six selected features achieved good prediction efficiency, including radiomics characteristics and tumor location information (central or peripheral), which demonstrated good calibration and discrimination ability in the training (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.884, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.826-0.941) and testing (AUC = 0.881, 95% CI: 0.8031-0.959) sets. Clinical decision curves demonstrated that the nomogram was clinically useful.

This study intended to evaluate the performance of whole-brain dynamic radiomics features (DRF) for ischemic stroke detection, neurological impairment assessment, and outcome prediction.The supervised feature selection (Lasso) and unsupervised feature-selection methods (five-feature dimension-reduction algorithms) were used to generate four experimental groups with DRF in different combinations. Ten machine learning models were used to evaluate their performance by ten-fold cross-validation.In experimental group_A, the best AUCs (0.873 for stroke detection, 0.795 for NIHSS assessment, and 0.818 for outcome prediction) were obtained by outstanding DRF selected by Lasso, and the performance of significant DRF was better than the five-feature dimension-reduction algorithms. The selected outstanding dimension-reduction DRF in experimental group_C obtained a better AUC than dimension-reduction DRF in experimental group_A but were inferior to the outstanding DRF in experimental group_A. When combining the outstanding DRF with each dimension-reduction DRF (experimental group_B), the performance can be improved in ischemic stroke detection (best AUC = 0.899) and NIHSS assessment (best AUC = 0.835) but failed in outcome prediction (best AUC = 0.806). The performance can be further improved when combining outstanding DRF with outstanding dimension-reduction DRF (experimental group_D), achieving the highest AUC scores in all three evaluation items (0.925 for stroke detection, 0.853 for NIHSS assessment, and 0.828 for outcome prediction). By the method in this study, comparing the best AUC of Ft-test in experimental group_A and the best_AUC in experimental group_D, the AUC in stroke detection increased by 19.4% (from 0.731 to 0.925), the AUC in NIHSS assessment increased by 20.1% (from 0.652 to 0.853), and the AUC in prognosis prediction increased by 14.9% (from 0.679 to 0.828).

10.3390/cancers14194664,,,A Machine Learning-Based Predictive Model of Epidermal Growth Factor Mutations in Lung Adenocarcinomas,"Data from 758 patients with lung adenocarcinoma were retrospectively collected. All patients had undergone computed tomography imaging and EGFR gene testing. Radiomic features were extracted using the medical imaging tool 3D-Slicer and were combined with the clinical features to build a machine learning prediction model. The high-dimensional feature set was screened for optimal feature subsets using principal component analysis (PCA) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Model prediction of EGFR mutation status in the validation group was evaluated using multiple classifiers. We showed that six clinical features and 622 radiomic features were initially collected. Thirty-one radiomic features with non-zero correlation coefficients were obtained by LASSO regression, and 24 features correlated with label values were obtained by PCA. The shared radiomic features determined by these two methods were selected and combined with the clinical features of the respective patient to form a subset of features related to EGFR mutations. The full dataset was partitioned into training and test sets at a ratio of 7:3 using 10-fold cross-validation. The area under the curve (AUC) of the four classifiers with cross-validations was: (1) K-nearest neighbor (AUCmean = 0.83, Acc = 81%); (2) random forest (AUCmean = 0.91, Acc = 83%); (3) LGBM (AUCmean = 0.94, Acc = 88%); and (4) support vector machine (AUCmean = 0.79, Acc = 83%). In summary, the subset of radiographic and clinical features selected by feature engineering effectively predicted the EGFR mutation status of this NSCLC patient cohort.","Ronghai He,Ruimin He,Xiaohua Yang,Xiaohua Yang,Tengxiang Li,Tengxiang Li,Yaolin He,Yaolin He,Xiaoxue Xie,Xiaoxue Xie,Qilei Chen,Qilei Chen,Zijian Zhang,Zijian Zhang,Tingting Cheng,Tingting Cheng",Cancers,2022.0

However, MRI is not practical for all patients who present with possible stroke and would lead to delayed treatment. The detection rate of EBI on non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is currently very low. Thus, we aimed to develop and validate the radiomics feature-based machine learning models to detect EBI (RMEBIs) on NCCT.In this retrospective observational study, 355 participants from a multicentre multimodal database established by Huashan Hospital were randomly divided into two data sets: a training cohort (70%) and an internal validation cohort (30%). Fifty-seven participants from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University were included as the external validation cohort. Brainstems were segmented by a radiologist committee on NCCT and 1781 radiomics features were automatically computed. After selecting the relevant features, 7 machine learning models were assessed in the training cohort to predict early brainstem infarction. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, F1-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the performance of the prediction models.The multilayer perceptron (MLP) RMEBI showed the best performance (AUC: 0.99 [95% CI: 0.96-1.00]) in the internal validation cohort. The AUC value in external validation cohort was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.82-0.98).RMEBIs have the potential in routine clinical practice to enable accurate computer-assisted diagnoses of early brainstem infarction in patients with NCCT, which may have important clinical value in reducing therapeutic decision-making time.• RMEBIs have the potential to enable accurate diagnoses of early brainstem infarction in patients with NCCT. • RMEBIs are suitable for various multidetector CT scanners. • The patient treatment decision-making time is shortened.","Haiyan Zhang,Haiyan Zhang,Hongyi Chen,Hongyi Chen,Chao Zhang,Chao Zhang,Aihong Cao,Aihong Cao,Qingqing Lu,Qingqing Lu,Hao Wu,Hao Wu,Jun Zhang,Jun Zhang,Daoying Geng,Daoying Geng",European Radiology,2022.0

A total of 96 patients with parasellar tumors (40 cavernous hemangiomas and 56 meningiomas) were enrolled in this retrospective multiple-center study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the clinical factors and semantic features of MRI scans. Radiomics features were extracted from five MRI sequences using radiomics software. Three feature selection methods and six classifiers were evaluated in the training cohort to construct favorable radiomic machine-learning classifiers. The performance of different classifiers was evaluated using the AUC and compared to neuroradiologists. The detection rates of T1WI, T2WI, and CE-T1WI for parasellar cavernous hemangiomas and meningiomas were approximately 100%. In contrast, the ADC maps had the detection rate of 18/22 and 19/25, respectively, (AUC, 0.881) with 2.25 cm as the critical value diameter. Radiomics models with the SVM and KNN classifiers based on T2WI and ADC maps had favorable predictive performances (AUC > 0.90 and F-score value > 0.80). These models outperformed MRI model (AUC 0.805) and neuroradiologists (AUC, 0.756 and 0.545, respectively). Radiomic models based on T2WI and ADC and combined with SVM and KNN classifiers have the potential to be a viable method for differentiating parasellar hemangiomas from meningiomas. T2WI is more universally applicable than ADC values due to its higher detection rate for parasellar tumors.","Chunjie Wang,Chunjie Wang,Lidong You,Lidong You,Xiyou Zhang,Xiyou Zhang,Yifeng Zhu,Yifeng Zhu,Li Zheng,Zheng Li,Wangle Huang,Wangle Huang,Dongmei Guo,Dongmei Guo,Yang Dong,Dong Yang",Scientific Reports,2022.0
10.1186/s13244-022-01279-4,,,A systematic review of radiomics in pancreatitis: applying the evidence level rating tool for promoting clinical transferability,"Abstract Background Multiple tools have been applied to radiomics evaluation, while evidence rating tools for this field are still lacking. This study aims to assess the quality of pancreatitis radiomics research and test the feasibility of the evidence level rating tool. Results Thirty studies were included after a systematic search of pancreatitis radiomics studies until February 28, 2022, via five databases. Twenty-four studies employed radiomics for diagnostic purposes. The mean ± standard deviation of the adherence rate was 38.3 ± 13.3%, 61.3 ± 11.9%, and 37.1 ± 27.2% for the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS), the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) checklist, and the Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) guideline for preprocessing steps, respectively. The median (range) of RQS was 7.0 (− 3.0 to 18.0). The risk of bias and application concerns were mainly related to the index test according to the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. The meta-analysis on differential diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis versus pancreatic cancer by CT and mass-forming pancreatitis versus pancreatic cancer by MRI showed diagnostic odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of, respectively, 189.63 (79.65–451.48) and 135.70 (36.17–509.13), both rated as weak evidence mainly due to the insufficient sample size. Conclusions More research on prognosis of acute pancreatitis is encouraged. The current pancreatitis radiomics studies have insufficient quality and share common scientific disadvantages. The evidence level rating is feasible and necessary for bringing the field of radiomics from preclinical research area to clinical stage.","Jingyu Zhong,Jingyu Zhong,Yangfan Hu,Yangfan Hu,Yue Xing,Yue Xing,Xiang Ge,Xiang Ge,Xiang Ge,Defang Ding,Defang Ding,Huan Zhang,Huan Zhang,Weiwu Yao,Weiwu Yao",Insights Into Imaging,2022.0
10.1161/svin.122.000525,,,Ability of Radiomics Versus Humans in Predicting First‐Pass Effect After Endovascular Treatment in the ESCAPE‐NA1 Trial,"BACKGROUND First‐pass effect (FPE), that is, achieving reperfusion with a single thrombectomy device pass, is associated with better clinical outcomes in patients with acute stroke. FPE is therefore increasingly used as a marker of device and procedural efficacy. We aimed to evaluate the ability of thrombus‐based radiomics models to predict FPE in patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy and compare performance with experts and nonradiomics thrombus characteristics. METHODS Patients with thin‐slice noncontrast computed tomography and computed tomography angiography from the ESCAPE‐NA1 (Efficacy and Safety of Nerinetide for the Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke) trial were included. Thrombi were manually segmented on all images. Data were randomly split into a derivation set that included a training and a validation subset and an independent test set. Radiomics features were extracted from the derivation set. The machine learning models were compared with 3 expert stroke physicians in predicting FPE in the test set using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS Thin‐slice images of 554 patients were divided into a derivation set (training [n=388] and validation [n=55]) and a test set (n=111). A radiomics model using the combination of noncontrast computed tomography, computed tomography angiography, and noncontrast computed tomography–computed tomography angiography difference achieved the highest performance (area under the curve, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.64–0.84]) for prediction of FPE. This was higher than the mean area under the curve of the 3 experts (0.62 [95% CI, 0.53–0.71], P =0.01 for difference in area under the curves). The radiomics model also performed better than nonradiomics‐based thrombus features such as volume and permeability measurements in predicting FPE ( P &lt;0.05). Addition of device type did not improve the performance of the chosen radiomics model in predicting FPE. CONCLUSION A radiomics‐based machine learning model of thrombus characteristics from noncontrast computed tomography and computed tomography angiography performs better than experts and traditional nonradiomics imaging features in predicting FPE in patients with acute stroke treated with endovascular thrombectomy.","Fouzi Bala,Fouzi Bala,Wu Qiu,Wu Qiu,Kairan Zhu,Kairan Zhu,Manon Kappelhof,Manon Kappelhof,Petra Cimflova,Petra Cimflová,Beom Joon Kim,Beom Joon Kim,Rosalie McDonough,Rosalie McDonough,Nishita Singh,Nishita Singh,Nima Kashani,Nima Kashani,Jianhai Zhang,Jianhai Zhang,Mohamed Najm,Mohamed Najm,Johanna M.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a potentially reliable assistant for the medical imaging recognition. We systematically review articles on the diagnostic performance of AI in OC from medical imaging for the first time. <h3>Methods</h3> The Medline, Embase, IEEE, PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library databases were searched for related studies published until August 1, 2022. Inclusion criteria were studies that developed or used AI algorithms in the diagnosis of OC from medical images. The binary diagnostic accuracy data were extracted to derive the outcomes of interest: sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The study was registered with the PROSPERO, CRD42022324611. <h3>Findings</h3> Thirty-four eligible studies were identified, of which twenty-eight studies were included in the meta-analysis with a pooled SE of 88% (95%CI: 85–90%), SP of 85% (82–88%), and AUC of 0.93 (0.91–0.95). Analysis for different algorithms revealed a pooled SE of 89% (85–92%) and SP of 88% (82–92%) for machine learning; and a pooled SE of 88% (84–91%) and SP of 84% (80–87%) for deep learning. Acceptable diagnostic performance was demonstrated in subgroup analyses stratified by imaging modalities (Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or Computed Tomography), sample size (≤300 or >300), AI algorithms versus clinicians, year of publication (before or after 2020), geographical distribution (Asia or non Asia), and the different risk of bias levels (≥3 domain low risk or < 3 domain low risk). <h3>Interpretation</h3> AI algorithms exhibited favorable performance for the diagnosis of OC through medical imaging.

10.1177/02841851221126596,36120843.0,,CT-based radiomics signature to predict CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in non-small-cell lung cancer,"Background An abundance of CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the center of solid tumors is a reliable predictive biomarker for patients eligible for immunotherapy. Purpose To develop a computed tomography (CT)-based radiomics signature for a preoperative prediction of an abundance of CD8+ TILs in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Material and Methods In this retrospective study, 117 consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed NSCLC were included and randomly divided into training (n = 77) and test sets (n = 40). A total of 107 radiomics features were extracted from the three-dimensional volumes of interest of each patient. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to select the strongest features for abundance of CD8+ TILs in NSCLC, and the radiomics score was constructed through a linear combination of these selected features. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the predictive performance of the radiomics score. Results The radiomics score was associated with an abundance of CD8+ TILs in NSCLC, which achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 (95% CI=0.73–0.92) and 0.68 (95% CI=0.54–0.87) in the training and test sets, respectively. The difference was not statistically significant ( P = 0.20). The tumors with high CD8+ TILs tended to have heterogeneous dependences (high value of Dependence Non-Uniformity Normalized) and complicated texture (high value of Informational Measure of Correlation 1). Conclusion CT-based radiomics features have the ability to predict CD8+ TILs expression levels of an abundance of CD8+ TILs in NSCLC, which was shown to be a potential imaging biomarker for stratifying patients who may benefit from immunotherapy.","Yaxi Chen,Yaxi Chen,Ting Xu,Ting Xu,Changsi Jiang,Changsi Jiang,Shuyuan You,Shuyuan You,Zhiqiang Cheng,Zhiqiang Cheng,Jingshan Gong,Jingshan Gong",Acta Radiologica,2022.0

All patients underwent preoperative CTC tests and CEUS examinations before treatment. The ultrasomics signature was extracted and built from CEUS images. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the significant variables related to ER, which were then combined to build a predictive nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by its discrimination, calibration and clinical utility. The predictive model was further evaluated in the internal validation cohort.HBV DNA, serum AFP level, CTC status, tumour size, and ultrasomics score were identified as independent predictors associated with ER (all p < 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the CTC status (OR = 7.02 [95% CI, 2.07 to 28.38], p = 0.003) and ultrasomics score (OR = 148.65 [95% CI, 25.49 to 1741.72], p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for ER.

10.1002/9781119857983.ch5,,,Deep Learning and Precision Medicine,"The healthcare system is transforming as a result of new technology invention and implementation, which promotes therapeutic interventions and treatment outcomes for improved patient care. Numerous diverse parameters like gene variation, sociodemographics, lifestyle/environmental elements, should be measured to expedite precision/personalized medicine (PM). As a result, one of the most important difficulties in PM is bridging the translational gap in the clinical context by transforming big, multimodal data into decision support tools. Deep learning (DL) offers a novel technique to overcome these challenges, enabling the building or acquisition of accuracy, multimodal predictive models that could help the PM vision become a reality shortly. DL along with modern artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, provides tools in the form of algorithms that could pave the way for an individualized malignancy treatment in a more precise and customized manner by allowing early diagnosis and precise treatment options. Machine learning (ML) techniques applied to genomic datasets have a lot of potentials to deliver PM. DL has the power to accurately analyze tumor data and recommend the best possible treatment for cancer patients with a personalized approach. The capacity to anticipate how a patient will respond to a medication using DL techniques will aid in the reevaluation of treatment decisions, as well as the reduction of errors and disease-related financial burden. This chapter discusses the overall characteristics of DL and PM, as well as the importance of DL in precision oncology drug discovery and development, genomics, and biomarker datasets.

Methods This retrospective study included consecutive patients with or without PCa who underwent surgery or biopsy after 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. A total of 944 radiomics features were extracted from the images. A radiomics model was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm with tenfold cross-validation in the training set. PET/CT images for the test set were reviewed by experienced nuclear medicine radiologists. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated for the model and radiologists’ results. The AUCs were compared. Results The total of 125 patients (86 PCa, 39 benign prostate disease [BPD]) included 87 (61 PCa, 26 BPD) in the training set and 38 (61 PCa, 26 BPD) in the test set. Nine features were selected to construct the radiomics model. The model score differed between PCa and BPD in the training and test sets (both P &lt; 0.001). In the test set, the radiomics model performed better than the radiologists’ assessment (AUC, 0.85 [95% confidence interval 0.73, 0.97] vs. 0.63 [0.47, 0.79]; P = 0.036) and showed higher sensitivity (model vs radiologists, 0.84 [0.63, 0.95] vs. 0.74 [0.53, 0.88]; P = 0.002).

Clinical applications are still limited, mostly due to reproducibility and repeatability issues as well as to limited interpretability of predictive radiomic-based features/signatures. In the specific case of gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, the expectancies are particularly high, mainly due to its increasing incidence and to the limited performance of conventional imaging techniques in assessing correct diagnosis and accurate pre-surgical tumor characterization. Accordingly, current literature was reviewed, emphasizing the methodological quality. In addition, papers were scored according to the Radiomic Quality Score (RQS), weighting more the clinical applicability and generalizability of the resulting models. According to the criteria of the search, only two papers were retained: the resulting technical quality was relatively high for both, while the corresponding RQS were 15 and 19 (on a scale of 31). Although the potentials of radiomics in the setting of GEJ adenocarcinoma are relevant, they remain largely unexplored, warranting an urgent need of high-quality, possibly prospective, multicenter studies.","Martina Mori,Martina Mori,Diego Palumbo,Diego Palumbo,Francesco De Cobelli,Francesco De Cobelli,C.

We aimed to correct this confounding effect of VOI variability by applying parametric maps with a fixed voxel size. Methods Ten scans of a cup filled with sodium chloride solution were scanned using a multislice computed tomography (CT) unit. Sphere-shaped VOIs with different diameters (4, 8, or 16 mm) were drawn centrally into the phantom. A total of 93 features were extracted conventionally from the original images using PyRadiomics. Using a self-designed and pretested software tool, parametric maps for the same 93 features with a fixed voxel size of 4 mm 3 were created. To retrieve the feature values from the maps, VOIs were copied from the original images to preserve the position. Differences in feature quantities between the VOI sizes were tested with the Mann-Whitney U -test and agreement with overall concordance correlation coefficients (OCCC). Results Fifty-five conventionally extracted features were significantly different between the VOI sizes, and none of the features showed excellent agreement in terms of OCCCs. When read from the parametric maps, only 8 features showed significant differences, and 3 features showed an excellent OCCC (≥ 0.85). The OCCCs for 89 features substantially increased using the parametric maps. Conclusions This phantom study shows that converting CT images into parametric maps resolves the confounding effect of VOI variability and increases feature reproducibility across VOI sizes.","Laura J.

A total of 1110 patients were studied from a publicly available dataset with 4-class severity scoring performed by a radiologist (based on CT images and clinical features). The entire lungs were segmented and followed by resizing, bin discretization and radiomic features extraction. We utilized two feature selection algorithms, namely bagging random forest (BRF) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), each coupled to a classifier, namely multinomial logistic regression (MLR), to construct multiclass classification models. The dataset was divided into 50% (555 samples), 20% (223 samples), and 30% (332 samples) for training, validation, and untouched test datasets, respectively. Subsequently, nested cross-validation was performed on train/validation to select the features and tune the models. All predictive power indices were reported based on the testing set. The performance of multi-class models was assessed using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy based on the 4 × 4 confusion matrices. In addition, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for multi-class classifications were calculated and compared for both models. Using BRF, 23 radiomic features were selected, 11 from first-order, 9 from GLCM, 1 GLRLM, 1 from GLDM, and 1 from shape. Ten features were selected using the MARS algorithm, namely 3 from first-order, 1 from GLDM, 1 from GLRLM, 1 from GLSZM, 1 from shape, and 3 from GLCM features. The mean absolute deviation, skewness, and variance from first-order and flatness from shape, and cluster prominence from GLCM features and Gray Level Non Uniformity Normalize from GLRLM were selected by both BRF and MARS algorithms. All selected features by BRF or MARS were significantly associated with four-class outcomes as assessed within MLR (All p values &lt; 0.05). BRF + MLR and MARS + MLR resulted in pseudo-R 2 prediction performances of 0.305 and 0.253, respectively. Meanwhile, there was a significant difference between the feature selection models when using a likelihood ratio test ( p value = 0.046). Based on confusion matrices for BRF + MLR and MARS + MLR algorithms, the precision was 0.856 and 0.728, the recall was 0.852 and 0.722, whereas the accuracy was 0.921 and 0.861, respectively. AUCs (95% CI) for multi-class classification were 0.846 (0.805–0.887) and 0.807 (0.752–0.861) for BRF + MLR and MARS + MLR algorithms, respectively. Our models based on the utilization of radiomic features, coupled with machine learning were able to accurately classify patients according to the severity of pneumonia, thus highlighting the potential of this emerging paradigm in the prognostication and management of COVID-19 patients.","Isaac Shiri,Isaac Shiri,Shayan Mostafaei,Shayan Mostafaei,Atlas Haddadi Avval,Atlas Haddadi Avval,Yazdan Salimi,Yazdan Salimi,Amirhossein Sanaat,Amirhossein Sanaat,Azadeh Akhavanallaf,Azadeh Akhavanallaf,Hossein Arabi,Hossein Arabi,Arman Rahmim,Arman Rahmim,Habib Zaidi,Habib Zaidi",Scientific Reports,2022.0

The associations of ITHscore with tumor phenotypes, genotypes, and patient’s prognosis were examined on six patient cohorts (n = 1399) to validate its effectiveness in characterizing ITH.ResultsFor stage I NSCLC, ITHscore was consistent with tumor progression from stage IA1 to IA3 (p < 0.001) and captured key pathological change in terms of malignancy (p < 0.001). ITHscore distinguished the presence of lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.003) and pleural invasion (p = 0.001) in tumors. ITHscore also separated patient groups with different overall survival (p = 0.004) and disease-free survival conditions (p = 0.005). Radiogenomic analysis showed that the level of ITHscore in stage I and stage II NSCLC is correlated with heterogeneity-related pathways. In addition, ITHscore was proved to be a stable measurement and can be applied to ITH quantification in head-and-neck cancer (HNC).ConclusionsITH in NSCLC can be quantified from CT images by ITHscore, which is an indicator for tumor phenotypes and patient’s prognosis.Key Points • ITHscore provides a radiomic quantification of intra-tumor heterogeneity in NSCLC. • ITHscore is an indicator for tumor phenotypes and patient’s prognosis. • ITHscore has the potential to be generalized to other cancer types such as HNC.","Jiaqi Li,Jiaqi Li,Zhicong Qiu,Zhenbin Qiu,Chao Zhang,Chao Zhang,Sijie Chen,Sijie Chen,Mengmin Wang,Meng-Min Wang,Qiuchen Meng,Qiuchen Meng,Haiming Lu,Huazhong Lu,Lei Wei,Lei Wei,Hairong Lv,Hairong Lv,Wen‐Zhao Zhong,Wenzhao Zhong,Xuegong Zhang,Xuegong Zhang",European Radiology,2022.0

A systematic review,"Checkpoint inhibition has radically improved the perspective for patients with metastatic cancer, but predicting who will not respond with high certainty remains difficult. Imaging-derived biomarkers may be able to provide additional insights into the heterogeneity in tumour response between patients. In this systematic review, we aimed to summarise and qualitatively assess the current evidence on imaging biomarkers that predict response and survival in patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors in all cancer types.PubMed and Embase were searched from database inception to 29th November 2021. Articles eligible for inclusion described baseline imaging predictive factors, radiomics and/or imaging machine learning models for predicting response and survival in patients with any kind of malignancy treated with checkpoint inhibitors. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUIPS and PROBAST tools and data was extracted.In total, 119 studies including 15,580 patients were selected. Of these studies, 73 investigated simple imaging factors. 45 studies investigated radiomic features or deep learning models. Predictors of worse survival were (i) higher tumour burden, (ii) presence of liver metastases, (iii) less subcutaneous adipose tissue, (iv) less dense muscle and (v) presence of symptomatic brain metastases. Hazard rate ratios did not exceed 2.00 for any predictor in the larger and higher quality studies. The added value of baseline fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography parameters in predicting response to treatment was limited. Pilot studies of radioactive drug tracer imaging showed promising results. Reports on radiomics were almost unanimously positive, but numerous methodological concerns exist.There is well-supported evidence for several imaging biomarkers that can be used in clinical decision making. Further research, however, is needed into biomarkers that can more accurately identify which patients who will not benefit from checkpoint inhibition. Radiomics and radioactive drug labelling appear to be promising approaches for this purpose.","L.S. ter Maat,Laurens S. ter Maat,Isabella A.J. van Duin,Isabella A.J. van Duin,Sjoerd G.

Methods This retrospective analysis included 381 patients with 1,799 lymph nodes (450 malignant, 1,349 negative). The data set was divided into a training and validation set. A radiomics analysis with 4 filters and 6 algorithms resulting in 24 different radiomics signatures and a bootstrap algorithm (Bagging) with 30 bootstrap iterations was performed. A decision curve analysis was applied to generate a net benefit to compare the radiomics signature to two expert radiologists as one-by-one and as a prescreening tool in combination with the respective radiologist and only the radiologists. Results All 24 modeling methods showed good and reliable discrimination for malignant/benign LNs (area under the curve 0.75−0.87). The decision curve analysis showed a net benefit for the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) classifier for the entire probability range and outperformed the expert radiologists except for the high probability range. Using the radiomics signature as a prescreening tool for the radiologists did not improve net benefit. Conclusions Radiomics showed good discrimination power irrespective of the modeling technique in detecting LN metastases in patients with known lung cancer. The LASSO classifier was a suitable diagnostic tool and even outperformed the expert radiologists, except for high probabilities. Radiomics failed to improve clinical benefit as a prescreening tool.","Boris Gorodetski,Boris Gorodetski,Philipp Hendrik Becker,Philipp Hendrik Becker,Alexander Baur,Alexander Daniel Jacques Baur,Alexander Hartenstein,Alexander Hartenstein,Julian Manuel Michael Rogasch,J Rogasch,Christian Furth,Christian Furth,Holger Amthauer,Holger Amthauer,Bernd Hamm,Bernd Hamm,Marcus Makowski,Marcus R.

Fifty patients from the primary cohort were enrolled in this study. The clinical data, preoperative cranial CT images, and initial intracranial pressure readings were collected and used to develop a prediction model. Data of 20 patients from another hospital was used to validate the model. Clinical features including age, gender, midline shift, basilar cistern status, and ventriculocranial ratio were measured. Radiomic features, i.e., 18 first-order and 40 second-order features were extracted from the CT images. Lasso method was used for features filtration. Multivariate logistic regression was used to develop three prediction models with clinical (CF model), first-order (FO model), and second-order features (SO model). The SO model achieved the most robust ability to predict intracranial hypertension. Internal validation showed that the C-statistic of the model was 0.811 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.691-0.931) with the bootstrapping method. The Hosmer Lemeshow test and calibration curve also showed that the SO model had excellent performance. The external validation results showed a good discrimination with an area under the curve of 0.725 (95% CI: 0.500-0.951). Although the FO model was inferior to the SO model, it had better prediction ability than the CF model. The study shows that the radiomic features analysis, especially second-order features can be used to evaluate intracranial hypertension noninvasively compared to conventional clinical features, given its potential for clinical practice and further research.","Yihua Li,Yihua Li,Guoqing Zhang,Guoqing Zhang,Yingchi Shan,Yingchi Shan,Xiang Wu,Xiang Wu,Jiaqi Liu,Jiaqi Liu,Yajun Xue,Yajun Xue,Guoyi Gao,Guo-Yi Gao",Journal of Neurotrauma,2022.0

This study investigates the classification performance and robustness of machine learning radiomics models in heterogeneous MRI datasets to characterize suspicious prostate lesions for non-invasive prediction of prostate cancer (PCa) aggressiveness compared to conventional imaging biomarkers.A total of 142 patients with clinical suspicion of PCa underwent 1.5T or 3T biparametric MRI (7 scanner types, 14 institutions) and exhibited suspicious lesions [prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score ≥3] in peripheral or transitional zones. Whole-gland and index-lesion segmentations were performed semi-automatically. A total of 1,482 quantitative morphologic, shape, texture, and intensity-based radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-images and assessed using random forest and logistic regression models. Five-fold cross-validation performance in terms of area under the ROC curve was compared to mean ADC (mADC), PI-RADS and prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD). Bias mitigation techniques targeting the high-dimensional feature space and inherent class imbalance were applied and robustness of results was systematically evaluated.Trained models showed mean area under the curves (AUCs) ranging from 0.78 to 0.83 in csPCa classification. Despite using mitigation techniques, high performance variability of results could be demonstrated. Trained models achieved on average numerically higher classification performance compared to clinical parameters PI-RADS (AUC =0.78), mADC (AUC =0.71) and PSAD (AUC =0.63).Radiomics models' classification performance of csPCa was numerically but not significantly higher than PI-RADS scoring. Overall, clinical applicability in heterogeneous MRI datasets is limited because of high variability of results. Performance variability, robustness and reproducibility of radiomics-based measures should be addressed more transparently in future research to enable broad clinical application.","Eva Gresser,Eva Gresser,B.

10.3389/fonc.2022.879376,,,Predicting IDH subtype of grade 4 astrocytoma and glioblastoma from tumor radiomic patterns extracted from multiparametric magnetic resonance images using a machine learning approach,"Background and purpose Semantic imaging features have been used for molecular subclassification of high-grade gliomas. Radiomics-based prediction of molecular subgroups has the potential to strategize and individualize therapy. Using MRI texture features, we propose to distinguish between IDH wild type and IDH mutant type high grade gliomas. Methods Between 2013 and 2020, 100 patients were retrospectively analyzed for the radiomics study. Immunohistochemistry of the pathological specimen was used to initially identify patients for the IDH mutant/wild phenotype and was then confirmed by Sanger’s sequencing. Image texture analysis was performed on contrast-enhanced T1 (T1C) and T2 weighted (T2W) MR images. Manual segmentation was performed on MR image slices followed by single-slice multiple sampling image augmentation. Both whole tumor multislice segmentation and single-slice multiple sampling approaches were used to arrive at the best model. Radiomic features were extracted, which included first-order features, second-order (GLCM—Grey level co-occurrence matrix), and shape features. Feature enrichment was done using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression, followed by radiomic classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a 10-fold cross-validation strategy for model development. The area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve and predictive accuracy were used as diagnostic metrics to evaluate the model to classify IDH mutant and wild-type subgroups. Results Multislice analysis resulted in a better model compared to the single-slice multiple-sampling approach. A total of 164 MR-based texture features were extracted, out of which LASSO regression identified 14 distinctive GLCM features for the endpoint, which were used for further model development. The best model was achieved by using combined T1C and T2W MR images using a Quadratic Support Vector Machine Classifier and a 10-fold internal cross-validation approach, which demonstrated a predictive accuracy of 89% with an AUC of 0.89 for each IDH mutant and IDH wild subgroup. Conclusion A machine learning classifier of radiomic features extracted from multiparametric MRI images (T1C and T2w) provides important diagnostic information for the non-invasive prediction of the IDH mutant or wild-type phenotype of high-grade gliomas and may have potential use in either escalating or de-escalating adjuvant therapy for gliomas or for using targeted agents in the future.","Pashmina Kandalgaonkar,Pashmina Kandalgaonkar,Arpita Sahu,Arpita Sahu,Ann Christy Saju,Ann Christy Saju,Akanksha Joshi,Akanksha Joshi,Abhishek Mahajan,Abhishek Mahajan,Meenakshi Thakur,Meenakshi Thakur,Ayushi Sahay,Ayushi Sahay,Sridhar Epari,Sridhar Epari,Shwetabh Sinha,Shwetabh Sinha,Archya Dasgupta,Archya Dasgupta,Abhishek Chatterjee,Abhishek Chatterjee,Prakash Shetty,Prakash Shetty,Aliasgar Moiyadi,Aliasgar Moiyadi,Jaiprakash Agarwal,Jitendra Agarwal,Tejpal Gupta,Tejpal Gupta,Jayant Sastri Goda,Jayant S.

The analysis was conducted on a monocentric dataset of 43 patients with evidence of isolated intraprostatic recurrence of prostate cancer after primary external beam radiotherapy. All patients received partial prostate re-irradiation delivered by volumetric modulated arc therapy. The gross tumor volume (GTV) of each patient was manually contoured from planning CT, choline-PET and dose maps. An ensemble machine learning pipeline including unbalanced data correction and feature selection was trained using the radiomic and dosiomic features as input for predicting occurrence of local failure. The model performance was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and area under receiver operating characteristic curves of the score function in 10-fold cross validation repeated 100 times. Local failure was observed in 13 patients (30%), with a median time to recurrence of 36.7 months (range = 6.1–102.4 months). A four variables ensemble machine learning model resulted in accuracy of 0.62 and AUC 0.65.

Fifty studies were selected, mainly based on Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), radiomics-based methods, and methods that exploit traditional imaging techniques for survival assessment. In addition, we focused on two distinct tasks related to survival assessment: the first on the classification of subjects into survival classes (short and long-term or eventually short, mid and long-term) to stratify patients in distinct groups. The second focused on quantification, in days or months, of the individual survival interval. Our survey showed excellent state-of-the-art methods for the first, with accuracy up to ∼98%. The latter task appears to be the most challenging, but state-of-the-art techniques showed promising results, albeit with limitations, with C-Index up to ∼0.91. In conclusion, according to the specific task, the available computational methods perform differently, and the choice of the best one to use is non-univocal and dependent on many aspects. Unequivocally, the use of features derived from quantitative imaging has been shown to be advantageous for AI applications, including survival prediction. This evidence from the literature motivates further research in the field of AI-powered methods for survival prediction in patients with brain tumors, in particular, using the wealth of information provided by quantitative MRI techniques.","Christian di Noia,Christian di Noia,James T.

10.1148/rycan.210107,36178349.0,,Prediction of Histologic Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Response in Osteosarcoma Using Pretherapeutic MRI Radiomics,"Histologic response to chemotherapy for osteosarcoma is one of the most important prognostic factors for survival, but assessment occurs after surgery. Although tumor imaging is used for surgical planning and follow-up, it lacks predictive value. Therefore, a radiomics model was developed to predict the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on pretreatment T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI. A total of 176 patients (median age, 20 years [range, 5-71 years]; 107 male patients) with osteosarcoma treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery between January 2007 and December 2018 in three different centers in France (Centre Léon Bérard in Lyon, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nantes in Nantes, and Hôpital Cochin in Paris) were retrospectively analyzed. Various models were trained from different configurations of the data sets. Two different methods of feature selection were tested with and without ComBat harmonization (ReliefF and t test) to select the most relevant features, and two different classifiers were used to build the models (an artificial neural network and a support vector machine). Sixteen radiomics models were built using the different combinations of feature selection and classifier applied on the various data sets. The most predictive model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95, a sensitivity of 91%, and a specificity 92% in the training set; respective values in the validation set were 0.97, 91%, and 92%. In conclusion, MRI-based radiomics may be useful to stratify patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for osteosarcomas.

To investigate the value of preoperative prediction of breast cancer axillary lymph node metastasis based on intratumoral and peritumoral dynamic contrast enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) radiomics nomogram. Material and Methods. In this study, a radiomics model was developed based on a training cohort involving 250 patients with breast cancer (BC) who had undergone axillary lymph node (ALN) dissection between June 2019 and January 2021. The intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics features were extracted from the second postcontrast images of DCE-MRI. Based on filtered radiomics features, the radiomics signature was built by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method. The Support Vector Machines (SVM) learning algorithm was used to construct intratumoral, periatumoral, and intratumoral combined periatumoral models for predicting axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) in BC. Nomogram performance was determined by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical value. Multivariable logistic regression was adopted to establish a radiomics nomogram. Results. The intratumoral combined peritumoral radiomics signature, which was composed of fifteen ALN status-related features, showed the best predictive performance and was associated with ALNM in both the training and validation cohorts ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1""> <mi>P</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.001</mn> </math> ). The prediction efficiency of the intratumoral combined peritumoral radiomics model was higher than that of the intratumoral radiomics model and the peritumoral radiomics model. The AUCs of the training and verification cohorts were 0.867 and 0.785, respectively. The radiomics nomogram, which incorporated the radiomics signature, MR-reported ALN status, and MR-reported maximum diameter of the lesion, showed good calibration and discrimination in the training (AUC = 0.872) and validation cohorts (AUC = 0.863). Conclusion. The intratumoral combined peritumoral radiomics model derived from DCE-MRI showed great predictive value for ALNM and may help to improve clinical decision-making for BC.","Ying Liu,Ying Liu,Xing Li,Xing Li,Lan Zhu,Lina Zhu,Zhiwei Zhao,Zhiwei Zhao,Wang Tuan,Tuan Wang,Xi Zhang,Xi Zhang,Bing Cai,Bing Cai,Li Li,Li Li,Mingrui Ma,Mingrui Ma,Xiaojian Ma,Xiaojian Ma,Jie Ming,Jie Ming",Contrast Media & Molecular Imaging,2022.0

Materials and methods LUAD patients treated with EGFR-TKIs were retrospectively included from three independent institutes and divided into training and validation cohorts. Intratumoral and peritumoral features were extracted from time-serial non-contrast chest CT (including pre-therapy and first follow-up images); moreover, the percentage variation per unit time (day) was introduced to adjust for the different follow-up periods of each patient. Test-retest was performed to exclude irreproducible features, while the Boruta algorithm was used to select critical radiomics features. Radiomics signatures were constructed with random forest survival models in the training cohort and compared against baseline clinical characteristics through Cox regression and nonparametric testing of concordance indices (C-indices). Results The training cohort included 131 patients (74 women, 56.5%) from one institute and the validation cohort encompassed 41 patients (24 women, 58.5%) from two other institutes. The optimal signature contained 10 features and 7 were unit time feature variations. The comprehensive radiomics model outperformed the pre-therapy clinical characteristics in predicting PFS (training: 0.78, 95% CI: [0.72, 0.84] versus 0.55, 95% CI: [0.49, 0.62], p &lt; 0.001; validation: 0.72, 95% CI: [0.60, 0.84] versus 0.54, 95% CI: [0.42, 0.66], p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Radiomics signature derived from time-serial CT images demonstrated optimal prognostic performance of disease progression. This dynamic imaging biomarker holds the promise of monitoring treatment response and achieving personalized management. Key Points • The intrinsic tumor heterogeneity can be highly dynamic under the therapeutic effect of EGFR-TKI treatment, and the inevitable development of drug resistance may disrupt the duration of clinical benefit. Decision-making remained challenging in practice to detect the emergence of acquired resistance during the early response phase. • Time-serial CT-based radiomics signature integrating intra- and peritumoral features offered the potential to predict progression-free survival for LUAD patients treated with EGFR-TKIs. • The dynamic imaging signature allowed for prognostic risk stratification.","Xiaobo Zhang,Xiaobo Zhang,Bingfeng Lu,LU Bing-feng,Xinguan Yang,Xia Yang,Dong Lan,Dong Liu,Shushen Lin,Shushen Lin,Zhipeng Zhou,Zhipeng Zhou,Kai Li,Kai Li,Dong Deng,Dong Deng,Peng Peng,Peng Peng,Zisan Zeng,Zisan Zeng,Liling Long,Liling Long",European Radiology,2022.0

There are three major types of gene mutations that a NSCLC patient’s gene structure can change to: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS), and Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). We worked with the clinical and genomics data for each of the 130 patients as well their corresponding PET/CT scans. We preprocessed all of the data and then built a novel pipeline to integrate both the image and tabular data. We built a novel pipeline that used a fusion of Convolutional Neural Networks and Dense Neural Networks. Also, using a search approach, we pick an ensemble of deep learning models to classify the separate gene mutations. These models include EfficientNets, SENet, and ResNeXt WSL, among others.

10.2174/1573405618666220822093226,,,Radiomics And Artificial Intelligence In Predicting Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis In Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review.,"Background: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy and the second most common cause of death in women worldwide. Axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) is the most significant prognostic factor in breast cancer. Under the current guidelines, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard of axillary staging in patients with clinically-node negative breast cancer. Despite the minimally invasive nature of SLNB, it can cause short and long-term morbidities including pain, sensory impairment, and upper limb motor dysfunction. However, lymphedema remains the most feared adverse event, and it affects 7% of patients within 36 months of follow-up. Recently, we have witnessed the implication of radiomics and artificial intelligence domains in the diagnosis and follow-up of many malignancies with promising results. Therefore, we have conducted a systematic search to investigate the potentials of radiomics and artificial intelligence in predicting ALNM. Methods: Four electronic databases were searched: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Web of Science. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis as our basis of organization. Results: For radiomics, area under the curve (AUC) for the included studies ranged from 0.715 to 0.93. Accuracy ranged from 67.7% to 98%. Sensitivity and specificity ranged from 70.3% to 97.8% and 58.4% to 98.2%, respectively. For other artificial intelligence methods, AUC ranged from 0.68 to 0.98, while accuracy ranged from 55% to 89%. Conclusion: The results of radiomics and artificial intelligence in predicting ALNM are promising. However, validation as a substitute to SLNB requires more substantial evidence from large randomized trials.","Abdullah S. Eldaly,Abdullah S. Eldaly,Francisco R. Ávila,Francisco R. Avila,Ricardo A.

The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of using an optic-nerve-based radiomics nomogram on water-fat imaging for detecting DON.This study included 104 orbits (83 in the training cohort) from 59 DON patients and 131 orbits (80 in the training cohort) from 69 thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) without DON patients. Radiomic features were extracted from the optic-nerve T2-weighted water-fat images for each patient. Selected radiomics features were retrained to construct the radiomic signature model and calculate the radiomic score (Rad-score). The conventional MRI evaluation model was constructed based on apical crowding sign, optic-nerve stretching sign and muscle index. The radiomics nomogram model combining the Rad-score and conventional MRI evaluation factors was then developed. Predictive performance of the three models was assessed using ROC curves.Eight radiomics features from water-fat imaging were selected to build the radiomics signature. The radiomics nomogram (based on Rad-score, apical crowding sign and optic-nerve stretching sign) had superior diagnostic performance than did the conventional MRI evaluation model (AUC in the training set: 0.92 vs 0.80, the validation set:0.88 vs 0.75). Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical usefulness of the radiomics nomogram.This optic-nerve-based radiomics nomogram showed better diagnostic performance than conventional MRI evaluation for differentiating DON from TAO without DON. The changes of the optic-nerve itself may deserve more consideration in the clinical decision-making process.","Hongyu Wu,Hongyu Wu,Ban Luo,Ban Luo,Yali Zhao,Yali Zhao,Gang Yuan,Gang Yuan,Qiuxia Wang,Qiuxia Wang,Ping Liu,Ping Liu,Linhan Zhai,Linhan Zhai,Wenzhi Lv,Wenzhi Lv,Jing Zhang,Jing Zhang",Insights Into Imaging,2022.0

While early radiomics-based methods were often limited to a smaller number of higher-order image feature extractions, applying machine learning-based analytic models, multifactorial correlations, and classifiers now permits big data processing and testing thousands of features to identify relevant markers. A growing number of novel deep learning-based methods describe magnetic resonance imaging- and computed tomography-based algorithms for diagnosing anterior cruciate ligament tears, meniscus tears, articular cartilage defects, rotator cuff tears, fractures, metastatic skeletal disease, and soft tissue tumors. Initial radiomics and deep learning techniques have focused on binary detection tasks, such as determining the presence or absence of a single abnormality and differentiation of benign versus malignant. Newer-generation algorithms aim to include practically relevant multiclass characterization of detected abnormalities, such as typing and malignancy grading of neoplasms. So-called delta-radiomics assess tumor features before and after treatment, with temporal changes of radiomics features serving as surrogate markers for tumor responses to treatment. New approaches also predict treatment success rates, surgical resection completeness, and recurrence risk. Practice-relevant goals for the next generation of algorithms include diagnostic whole-organ and advanced classification capabilities. Important research objectives to fill current knowledge gaps include well-designed research studies to understand how diagnostic performances and suggested efficiency gains of isolated research settings translate into routine daily clinical practice. This article summarizes current radiomics- and machine learning-based magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography approaches for musculoskeletal disease detection and offers a perspective on future goals and objectives.","Benjamin Fritz,Benjamin Fritz,Paul H.

Advances in medicine, such as improved surgical techniques, the development of new drugs and devices, the use of statistical methods in research, and the development of codes of ethics, have considerably influenced the way clinical trials are conducted today. In addition, methods from the broad field of artificial intelligence, such as radiomics, have the potential to considerably affect clinical trials and clinical practice in the future. Radiomics is a method to extract undiscovered features from routinely acquired imaging data that can neither be captured by means of human perception nor conventional image analysis. In patients with brain cancer, radiomics has shown its potential for the non-invasive identification of prognostic biomarkers, automated response assessment, and differentiation between treatment-related changes from tumour progression. Despite promising results, radiomics is not yet established in routine clinical practice nor in clinical trials. In this Viewpoint, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Brain Tumour Group summarises the current status of radiomics, discusses its potential and limitations, envisions its future role in clinical trials in neuro-oncology, and provides guidance on how to address the challenges in radiomics.","Philipp Lohmann,Philipp Lohmann,Enrico Franceschi,Enrico Franceschi,Philipp Vollmuth,Philipp Vollmuth,Frédéric Dhermain,Frédéric Dhermain,Michael Weller,Michael Weller,Matthias Preusser,Matthias Preusser,Marion Smits,Marion Smits,Norbert Galldiks,Norbert Galldiks",The Lancet Digital Health,2022.0
10.1007/978-3-031-11154-9_2,,,Radiomics: Approach to Precision Medicine,"AbstractPrecision medicine, as a concept of customization of healthcare for individual patients with diagnosis, treatments, and follow-up, has been a hot topic in recent years. Large-scale molecular-biology-level information, such as genome, proteome, and metabolome, is collected from patients for analyzing biomarkers for subpopulation of a particular disease. This is import for the targeted therapy, which is expected to be more effective and less harmful to normal cells than traditional chemotherapy. Meanwhile, due to the rapid development in medical imaging and machine learning technology, we are able to extract more and more “unseen” disease characteristics from medical images. Radiomics, a method that extracts a large number of features from medical images, has been established for a variety of purposes such as a prediction of risks for a particular disease, classification of lesions, a prediction of outcome of patients, etc. Genetic tests can provide prognostic information in breast cancer for both diagnosis and treatment planning. In this study, we developed a radiogenomics method to discover imaging biomarkers on breast MRI for prediction of genetic test results for breast cancer by means of our original sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) coupled with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that maximizes the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC). Our proposed method aimed at predicting the results of the 95-gene classifier (95-GC) and immune-related 23-gene signature (IRSN-23), which consists of a feature extraction from a tumor region, discovery of biomarkers based on our SFFS feature selection method, and an SVM classifier operated on the discovered imaging biomarkers. Our database contained 118 dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) breast MRI studies from 118 patients. We extracted 318 morphological and texture features from each segmented tumor region on DCE MRI in three phases (i.e., pre-contrast, early phase, and delayed phase). We achieved an AUC value of 0.97 with 22 discovered imaging biomarkers in predicting the results of 95-GC and that of 0.96 with 24 imaging biomarkers in predicting the results of IRSN-23 in a five-fold cross-validation test.KeywordsRadiomicsPersonalized medicineMedical image analysisMachine learningRadiogenomicsImaging biomarker","Ze Jin,Ze Jin,Taiguang Yuan,Taiguang Yuan,Yukiko Tokuda,Yukiko Tokuda,Yasuto Naoi,Yasuto Naoi,Noriyuki Tomiyama,Noriyuki Tomiyama,Kenji Suzuki,Kenji Suzuki",Intelligent systems reference library,2022.0

With Surgomics, we aim to facilitate personalized therapy recommendations in surgery by integration of intraoperative surgical data and their analysis with machine learning methods to leverage the potential of this data in analogy to Radiomics and Genomics. Methods We defined Surgomics as the entirety of surgomic features that are process characteristics of a surgical procedure automatically derived from multimodal intraoperative data to quantify processes in the operating room. In a multidisciplinary team we discussed potential data sources like endoscopic videos, vital sign monitoring, medical devices and instruments and respective surgomic features. Subsequently, an online questionnaire was sent to experts from surgery and (computer) science at multiple centers for rating the features’ clinical relevance and technical feasibility. Results In total, 52 surgomic features were identified and assigned to eight feature categories. Based on the expert survey ( n = 66 participants) the feature category with the highest clinical relevance as rated by surgeons was “surgical skill and quality of performance” for morbidity and mortality (9.0 ± 1.3 on a numerical rating scale from 1 to 10) as well as for long-term (oncological) outcome (8.2 ± 1.8). The feature category with the highest feasibility to be automatically extracted as rated by (computer) scientists was “Instrument” (8.5 ± 1.7). Among the surgomic features ranked as most relevant in their respective category were “intraoperative adverse events”, “action performed with instruments”, “vital sign monitoring”, and “difficulty of surgery”. Conclusion Surgomics is a promising concept for the analysis of intraoperative data. Surgomics may be used together with preoperative features from clinical data and Radiomics to predict postoperative morbidity, mortality and long-term outcome, as well as to provide tailored feedback for surgeons.

In addition to its potential, several limitations have been identified in this field, and most importantly the effects of variations in imaging parameters on radiomic features (RFs). In this study, we investigate the potential of RFs to predict overall survival in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma, as well as the impact of ComBat harmonization on the performance of RF models. We assessed the robustness of the results by performing the analyses a thousand times. Publicly available CT scans of 179 patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed. The scans were acquired using different imaging vendors and parameters in different medical centers. The performance was calculated by averaging the metrics over all runs. On average, the clinical model significantly outperformed the radiomic models. The use of ComBat harmonization, on average, did not significantly improve the performance of radiomic models. Hence, the variability in image acquisition and reconstruction parameters significantly affect the performance of radiomic models. The development of radiomic specific harmonization techniques remain a necessity for the advancement of the field.","Abdalla Ibrahim,Abdalla Ibrahim,Lin Lu,Lin Lü,Hao Yang,Hao Yang,Oguz Akin,Oğuz Akın,Lawrence H.

This retrospective study investigates the impact of PET segmentation method and the selection of different target lesions on the radiomic analysis of baseline 18F[FDG] PET/CT images in a population of newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients. The whole tumor burden was segmented on PET images applying six methods: (1) 2.5 standardized uptake value (SUV) threshold; (2) 25% maximum SUV (SUVmax) threshold; (3) 42% SUVmax threshold; (4) 1.3∙liver uptake threshold; (5) intersection among 1, 2, 4; and (6) intersection among 1, 3, 4. For each method, total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) and whole-body total lesion glycolysis (WTLG) were assessed, and their association with survival outcomes (progression-free survival PFS and overall survival OS) was investigated. Methods 1 and 2 provided stronger associations and were selected for the next steps. Radiomic analysis was then performed on two target lesions for each patient: the one with the highest SUV and the largest one. Fifty-three radiomic features were extracted, and radiomic scores to predict PFS and OS were obtained. Two proportional-hazard regression Cox models for PFS and OS were developed: (1) univariate radiomic models based on radiomic score; and (2) multivariable clinical–radiomic model including radiomic score and clinical/diagnostic parameters (IPI score, SUVmax, TMTV, WTLG, lesion volume). The models were created in the four scenarios obtained by varying the segmentation method and/or the target lesion; the models’ performances were compared (C-index). In all scenarios, the radiomic score was significantly associated with PFS and OS both at univariate and multivariable analysis (p &lt; 0.001), in the latter case in association with the IPI score. When comparing the models’ performances in the four scenarios, the C-indexes agreed within the confidence interval. C-index ranges were 0.79–0.81 and 0.80–0.83 for PFS radiomic and clinical–radiomic models; 0.82–0.87 and 0.83–0.90 for OS radiomic and clinical–radiomic models. In conclusion, the selection of either between two PET segmentation methods and two target lesions for radiomic analysis did not significantly affect the performance of the prognostic models built on radiomic and clinical data of DLBCL patients.

In the training cohort, the clinical and radiomics features were analyzed to construct the clinical model, tri-phase radiomics signatures and nomogram. Two kinds of methods were employed to achieve dimensionality reduction: (I) the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO); and (II) the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithms. We utilized Logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), Decision tree and Adaptive boosted tree (AdaBoost) algorithms as the machine learning classifiers. The nomogram was constructed on the clinical characteristics and the Rad-score. The performance of the models was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC), Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) curve and calibration curve.The 345 pT4b and 359 no-pT4b stage patients were included in this study. In the validation cohort, the AUC of the clinical model was 0.793 (95% CI: 0.732-0.855). The tri-phase radiomics features combined with the SVM algorithm was the best radiomics signature with an AUC of 0.862 (95% CI: 0.812-0.912). The nomogram was the best predictive model of all with an AUC of 0.893 (95% CI: 0.834-0.927). In the training and validation cohorts, the calibration curves and DCA curves of the nomogram showed satisfactory result.CE-CT-based radiomics nomogram offers good accuracy and stability in differentiating preoperative cT4 stage gastric cancer patients into pT4b and non-pT4b stages, which has a great clinical relevance for selecting the course of treatment for cT4 stage gastric cancer patients.","Bo Liu,Bo Liu,Dengyun Zhang,Dengyun Zhang,He Wang,He Wang,Hexiang Wang,Hexiang Wang,Pengfei Zhang,Pengfei Zhang,Dawei Zhang,Dawei Zhang,Qun Zhang,Qun Zhang,Jian Zhang,Jian Zhang",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,2022.0
10.1038/s41598-022-19009-7,36042326.0,,The utility of texture analysis of kidney MRI for evaluating renal dysfunction with multiclass classification model,"Abstract We evaluated a multiclass classification model to predict estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) groups in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) texture analysis (TA). We identified 166 CKD patients who underwent MRI comprising Dixon-based T1-weighted in-phase (IP)/opposed-phase (OP)/water-only (WO) images, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and T2* maps. The patients were divided into severe, moderate, and control groups based on eGFR borderlines of 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . After extracting 93 texture features (TFs), dimension reduction was performed using inter-observer reproducibility analysis and sequential feature selection (SFS) algorithm. Models were created using linear discriminant analysis (LDA); support vector machine (SVM) with linear, rbf, and sigmoid kernels; decision tree (DT); and random forest (RF) classifiers, with synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Models underwent 100-time repeat nested cross-validation. Overall performances of our classification models were modest, and TA based on T1-weighted IP/OP/WO images provided better performance than those based on ADC and T2* maps. The most favorable result was observed in the T1-weighted WO image using RF classifier and the combination model was derived from all T1-weighted images using SVM classifier with rbf kernel. Among the selected TFs, total energy and energy had weak correlations with eGFR.","Yuki Hara,Yuki Hara,Keita Nagawa,Keita Nagawa,Yuya Yamamoto,Y.

10.1002/acm2.13787,36173022.0,,Uniqueness of radiomic features in non‐small cell lung cancer,"The uniqueness of radiomic features, combined with their reproducibility, determines the reliability of radiomic studies. This study is to test the hypothesis that radiomic features extracted from a defined region of interest (ROI) are unique to the underlying structure (e.g., tumor).Two cohorts of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were retrospectively retrieved from a GE and a Siemens CT scanner. The lung nodules (ROI) were delineated manually and radiomic features were extracted using IBEX. The same ROI was then translocated randomly to four other tissue regions of the same set of images: adipose, heart, lung beyond nodule, and muscle for radiomic feature extraction. Coefficient of variation (CV) within different ROIs and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) between lung nodule and a given tissue region were calculated to test to determine feature uniqueness. The radiomic features were considered nonunique when (1) the CV < 10% and CCC > 0.85 for over 50% of patients; and (2) the CCC > 0.85 appeared in ≥2 tissue regions beyond the defined region.In total, 14 patients from GE and 18 patients from Siemens are analyzed. The results show that 12 features fall below the 10% CV threshold for over 50% of patients in the GE cohort and 29 features in the Siemens cohort. According to CCC, 18 radiomic features in GE and 16 features in Siemens are identified as nonunique, with 11 overlapping features. Combining CV and CCC, 9 of 123 calculated features (7.3%) are identified as nonunique to a defined ROI.Radiomic feature uniqueness should be considered to improve the reliability of radiomics study.","Gary Ge,Gary Ge,Jie Zhang,Jie Zhang",Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics,2022.0
10.21203/rs.3.rs-2055181/v1,,,Using radiomics to predict microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma based on multi-sequence gadoxetate disodium–enhanced MRI combined with clinical parameters,"Abstract Objectives: A radiomics machine learning model based on multimodal liver imaging and clinical data was established, and the application value of this model in the preoperative prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was analyzed. Methods: The preoperative liver MRI data and clinical information of 130 patients with pathologically confirmed HCC in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from March 2020 to September 2021 were retrospectively studied. According to the patients’ MVI status, they were divided into an MVI-positive group (MVI+) and an MVI-negative group (MVI-). The preoperative clinical parameters were taken as the clinical features, and the radiomics features were extracted from seven sequences of Gadoxetate disodium–enhanced MRI to construct the R-score. At the same time, the apparent imaging features of HCC were evaluated by radiologists. After LASSO screening, each group of features was used to build a single-factor or multifactor machine learning model, including four models: random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Support vector machine with rbf kernel function(rbf-SVM), and logistic regression (LR). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and calibration curves of the test cohort were used to evaluate the performance of various models, and finally, the best model was selected. Results: Alpha-fetoprotein concentration, peritumor enhancement, maximum tumor diameter, smooth tumor margins, tumor growth pattern, presence of intratumor hemorrhage, and RVI were independent predictors of MVI. Among the seven single-sequence models and one multi-sequence fusion model, the multi-sequence fusion model performed best (test cohort AUC: 0.913, 95% CI: 0.822-1.000). The performance of the four final models constructed after the R-score was combined with clinical parameters and apparent imaging features was as follows: RF (test cohort AUC: 0.935, 95% CI: 0.845-1.000, Brier score: 0.040), SVM (test cohort AUC: 0.939, 95% CI: 0.872-1.000, Brier score: 0.053), LR (test cohort AUC: 0.915, 95% CI: 0.815-1.000, Brier score: 0.062), and XGB (test cohort AUC: 0.921, 95% CI: 0.839-1.000, Brier score: 0.056). Conclusions: The multiparameter machine learning model has great performance in the preoperative prediction of MVI of HCC patients, which has certain auxiliary value for evaluating the prognosis of the disease and selecting a treatment plan.","Qinghua Wang,Qinghua Wang,Yongming Tan,Yongming Tan,Hongan Yang,Haijun Yang,Jingrun Zhang,Jingrun Zhang,Xiong Lei,Xiong Lei,Meng Liu,Meng Li,Laichang He,Laichang He",,2022.0
10.1016/j.aej.2022.10.069,,,A novel Multi-Level feature selection method for radiomics,"Radiomics is characterized by high-dimension and high redundancy. The existing Lasso-based feature selection does not consider features that are weakly correlated with the classification results, which will have a certain impact on the quality of feature subset. A multi-level feature selection algorithm based on Lasso coefficient threshold (Coe-Thr-Lasso) was proposed. Firstly, t -test and variance were used to remove the features that had little correlation with the classification results. Secondly, the proposed algorithm was used to remove features with redundancy and weak correlation of classification results. Three machine learning algorithms, including Logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), were verify the performance of the proposed algorithm on the non-small cell lung cancer subtype classification dataset. When modeling based on the feature subset generated by the proposed method, the proposed method achieved the best classification performance compared with other publication methods. Therefore, Coe-Thr-Lasso algorithm can effectively remove redundant and irrelevant features in radiomics, so as to improve the quality of feature subset and the ability of model generalization.","Ke Wang,Ke Wang,A.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics allow for discovery of novel patterns in medical images that can increase radiology’s role in management of patients with cancer, although methodological issues in the literature limit its clinical application. Using keywords related to immunotherapy and radiomics, we performed a literature review of MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and Embase from database inception through February 2022. We removed all duplicates, non-English language reports, abstracts, reviews, editorials, perspectives, case reports, book chapters, and non-relevant studies. From the remaining articles, the following information was extracted: publication information, sample size, primary tumor site, imaging modality, primary and secondary study objectives, data collection strategy (retrospective vs prospective, single center vs multicenter), radiomic signature validation strategy, signature performance, and metrics for calculation of a Radiomics Quality Score (RQS). We identified 351 studies, of which 87 were unique reports relevant to our research question. The median (IQR) of cohort sizes was 101 (57–180). Primary stated goals for radiomics model development were prognostication (n=29, 33.3%), treatment response prediction (n=24, 27.6%), and characterization of tumor phenotype (n=14, 16.1%) or immune environment (n=13, 14.9%). Most studies were retrospective (n=75, 86.2%) and recruited patients from a single center (n=57, 65.5%). For studies with available information on model testing, most (n=54, 65.9%) used a validation set or better. Performance metrics were generally highest for radiomics signatures predicting treatment response or tumor phenotype, as opposed to immune environment and overall prognosis. Out of a possible maximum of 36 points, the median (IQR) of RQS was 12 (10–16). While a rapidly increasing number of promising results offer proof of concept that AI and radiomics could drive precision medicine approaches for a wide range of indications, standardizing the data collection as well as optimizing the methodological quality and rigor are necessary before these results can be translated into clinical practice.","Laurent Dercle,Laurent Dercle,Jeremy McGale,Jeremy McGale,Shawn Sun,Shen-Su Sun,Aurélien Marabelle,Aurélien Marabelle,Randy Yeh,Randy Yeh,Eric Deutsch,Éric Deutsch,Fatima-Zohra Mokrane,Fatima-Zohra Mokrane,Michael Farwell,Michael D.

10.7150/thno.77949,36276650.0,,Artificial intelligence in pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer is the deadliest disease, with a five-year overall survival rate of just 11%. The pancreatic cancer patients diagnosed with early screening have a median overall survival of nearly ten years, compared with 1.5 years for those not diagnosed with early screening. Therefore, early diagnosis and early treatment of pancreatic cancer are particularly critical. However, as a rare disease, the general screening cost of pancreatic cancer is high, the accuracy of existing tumor markers is not enough, and the efficacy of treatment methods is not exact. In terms of early diagnosis, artificial intelligence technology can quickly locate high-risk groups through medical images, pathological examination, biomarkers, and other aspects, then screening pancreatic cancer lesions early. At the same time, the artificial intelligence algorithm can also be used to predict the survival time, recurrence risk, metastasis, and therapy response which could affect the prognosis. In addition, artificial intelligence is widely used in pancreatic cancer health records, estimating medical imaging parameters, developing computer-aided diagnosis systems, etc. Advances in AI applications for pancreatic cancer will require a concerted effort among clinicians, basic scientists, statisticians, and engineers. Although it has some limitations, it will play an essential role in overcoming pancreatic cancer in the foreseeable future due to its mighty computing power.","Bowen Huang,Bowen Huang,Haoran Huang,Haoran Huang,Shuting Zhang,Shuting Zhang,Dingyue Zhang,Dingyue Zhang,Qingya Shi,Qingya Shi,Jianzhou Liu,Jianzhou Liu,Junchao Guo,Junchao Guo",Theranostics,2022.0

A systematic review,"Abstract Objectives To provide an overarching evaluation of the value of peritumoral CT radiomics features for predicting the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer and to assess the quality of the available studies. Methods The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies predicting the prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using CT-based peritumoral radiomics features. Information about the patient, CT-scanner, and radiomics analyses were all extracted for the included studies. Study quality was assessed using the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) and the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). Results Thirteen studies were included with 2942 patients from 2017 to 2022. Only one study was prospective, and the others were all retrospectively designed. Manual segmentation and multicenter studies were performed by 69% and 46% of the included studies, respectively. 3D-Slicer and MATLAB software were most commonly used for the segmentation of lesions and extraction of features. The peritumoral region was most frequently defined as dilated from the tumor boundary of 15 mm, 20 mm, or 30 mm. The median RQS of the studies was 13 (range 4–19), while all of included studies were assessed as having a high risk of bias (ROB) overall. Conclusions Peritumoral radiomics features based on CT images showed promise in predicting the prognosis of NSCLC, although well-designed studies and further biological validation are still needed. Key Points • Peritumoral radiomics features based on CT images are promising and encouraging for predicting the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer. • The peritumoral region was often dilated from the tumor boundary of 15 mm or 20 mm because these were considered safe margins. • The median Radiomics Quality Score of the included studies was 13 (range 4–19), and all of studies were considered to have a high risk of bias overall.","Linyu Wu,Linyu Wu,Xinjing Lou,Xinjing Lou,Ning Kong,Ning Kong,Maosheng Xu,Maosheng Xu,Chen Gao,Chen Gao",European Radiology,2022.0

In this study, we analyzed the radiomics features of the whole pancreas between healthy individuals and pancreatic cancer patients, and we established a predictive model that can distinguish cancer patients from healthy individuals based on these radiomics features. Methods: We retrospectively collected venous-phase scans of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images from 181 control subjects and 85 cancer case subjects for radiomics analysis and predictive modeling. An attending radiation oncologist delineated the pancreas for all the subjects in the Varian Eclipse system, and we extracted 924 radiomics features using PyRadiomics. We established a feature selection pipeline to exclude redundant or unstable features. We randomly selected 189 cases (60 cancer and 129 control) as the training set. The remaining 77 subjects (25 cancer and 52 control) as a test set. We trained a Random Forest model utilizing the stable features to distinguish the cancer patients from the healthy individuals on the training dataset. We analyzed the performance of our best model by running 5-fold cross-validations on the training dataset and applied our best model to the test set. Results: We identified that 91 radiomics features are stable against various uncertainty sources, including bin width, resampling, image transformation, image noise, and segmentation uncertainty. Eight of the 91 features are nonredundant. Our final predictive model, using these 8 features, has achieved a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.99 ± 0.01 on the training dataset (189 subjects) by cross-validation. The model achieved an AUC of 0.910 on the independent test set (77 subjects) and an accuracy of 0.935.

We aimed to develop an effective model to predict hilar and mediastinal lymph node metastases by using texture features of solid nodule lung cancer. Methods Two hundred eighteen patients with solid nodules on CT images were analyzed retrospectively. The 3D tumors were delineated using ITK-SNAP software. Radiomics features were extracted from unenhanced and enhanced CT images based on AK software. Correlations between radiomics features of unenhanced and enhanced CT images were analyzed with Spearman rank correlation analysis. According to pathological findings, the patients were divided into no lymph node metastasis group and lymph node metastasis group. All patients were randomly divided into training group and test group at a ratio of 7:3. Valuable features were selected. Multivariate logistic regression was used to build predictive models. Two predictive models were established with unenhanced and enhanced CT images. ROC analysis was used to estimate the predictive efficiency of the models. Results A total of 7 categories of features, including 107 features, were extracted. There was a high correlation between the 7 categories of features from unenhanced CT images and enhanced CT images (all r &amp;gt; 0.7, p &amp;lt; 0.05). Among them, the shape features had the strongest correlation (mean r = 0.98). There were 5 features in the enhanced model and the unenhanced model, which had important predicting significance. The AUCs were 0.811 and 0.803, respectively. There was no significant difference in the predictive performance of the two models (DeLong's test, p = 0.05). Conclusion Our study models achieved higher accuracy for predicting hilar and mediastinal lymph node metastasis of solid nodule lung cancer and have some value in promoting the staging accuracy of lung cancer. Our results show that CT radiomics features have potential to predict hilar and mediastinal lymph node metastases in solid nodular lung cancer. In addition, enhanced and unenhanced CT radiomics models had comparable predictive power in predicting hilar and mediastinal lymph node metastases.","Huanchu Yuan,Huanchu Yuan,Yujian Zou,Yujian Zou,Yun Gao,Yun Gao,Shihao Zhang,Shihao Zhang,Xiaolin Zheng,Xiaolin Zheng,Xiaoting You,Xiaoting You",Frontiers in radiology,2022.0
10.3390/cancers14215397,36358815.0,,Current Applications of Artificial Intelligence to Classify Cervical Lymph Nodes in Patients with Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma—A Systematic Review,"Locally-advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is mainly defined by the presence of pathologic cervical lymph nodes (LNs) with or without extracapsular spread (ECS). Current radiologic criteria to classify LNs as non-pathologic, pathologic, or pathologic with ECS are primarily shape-based. However, significantly more quantitative information is contained within imaging modalities. This quantitative information could be exploited for classification of LNs in patients with locally-advanced HNSCC by means of artificial intelligence (AI). Currently, various reviews exploring the role of AI in HNSCC are available. However, reviews specifically addressing the current role of AI to classify LN in HNSCC-patients are sparse. The present work systematically reviews original articles that specifically explore the role of AI to classify LNs in locally-advanced HNSCC applying Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and the Study Quality Assessment Tool of National Institute of Health (NIH). Between 2001 and 2022, out of 69 studies a total of 13 retrospective, mainly monocentric, studies were identified. The majority of the studies included patients with oropharyngeal and oral cavity (9 and 7 of 13 studies, respectively) HNSCC. Histopathologic findings were defined as reference in 9 of 13 studies. Machine learning was applied in 13 studies, 9 of them applying deep learning. The mean number of included patients was 75 (SD ± 72; range 10–258) and of LNs was 340 (SD ± 268; range 21–791). The mean diagnostic accuracy for the training sets was 86% (SD ± 14%; range: 43–99%) and for testing sets 86% (SD ± 5%; range 76–92%).

On one DECT scanner, raw data were reconstructed using both conventional IR (adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction-V, ASIR-V) and DLIR. Nine sets of corresponding images were generated on other six DECT scanners using scanner-equipped conventional IR. Regions of interest were delineated through rigid registrations. Image quality was compared. Pyradiomics platform was used for radiomics feature extraction. Test-retest repeatability was assessed by Bland-Altman analysis for repeated scans. Inter-reconstruction algorithm reproducibility between conventional IR and DLIR was tested by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). Inter-scanner reproducibility was evaluated by coefficient of variation (CV) and quartile coefficient of dispersion (QCD). Robust features were identified.ResultsDLIR significantly improved image quality. Ninety-four radiomics features were extracted and nine features were considered as robust. 93.87% features were repeatable between repeated scans. ASIR-V images showed higher reproducibility to other conventional IR than DLIR (ICC mean, 0.603 vs 0.558, p = 0.001; CCC mean, 0.554 vs 0.510, p = 0.004). 7.45% and 26.83% features were reproducible among scanners evaluated by CV and QCD, respectively.ConclusionsDLIR improves quality of DECT images but may alter radiomics features compared to conventional IR. Nine robust DECT radiomics features were identified.Key Points • DLIR improves DECT image quality in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio compared with ASIR-V and showed the highest noise reduction rate and lowest peak frequency shift. • Most of radiomics features are repeatable between repeated DECT scans, while inter-reconstruction algorithm reproducibility between conventional IR and DLIR, and inter-scanner reproducibility, are low. • Although DLIR may alter radiomics features compared to IR algorithms, nine radiomics features survived repeatability and reproducibility analysis among DECT scanners and reconstruction algorithms, which allows further validation and clinical-relevant analysis.","Jingyu Zhong,Jingyu Zhong,Yihan Xia,Yunyan Xia,Yong Chen,Yong Chen,Jianying Li,Jianying Li,Wei Lu,Wei Lü,Xiaomeng Shi,Xiaomeng Shi,Jianxing Feng,Jianxing Feng,Fuhua Yan,Fuhua Yan,Weiwu Yao,Weiwu Yao,Huan Zhang,Huan Zhang",European Radiology,2022.0
10.1002/mp.16046,36251320.0,,Determining the reliable feature change in longitudinal radiomics studies: A methodological approach using the reliable change index,"Purpose Determination of reliable change of radiomics feature over time is essential and vital in delta-radiomics, but has not yet been rigorously examined. This study attempts to propose a methodological approach using reliable change index (RCI), a statistical metric to determine the reliability of quantitative biomarker changes by accounting for the baseline measurement standard error, in delta-radiomics. The use of RCI was demonstrated with the MRI data acquired from a group of prostate cancer (PCa) patients treated by 1.5 T MRI-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT). Methods Fifty consecutive PCa patients who underwent five-fractionated MRgRT were retrospectively included, and 1023 radiomics features were extracted from the clinical target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV). The two MRI datasets acquired at the first fraction (MRI11 and MRI21) were used to calculate the baseline feature reliability against image acquisition using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The RCI was constructed based on the baseline feature measurement standard deviation, ICC, and feature value differences at two time points between the fifth (MRI51) and the first fraction MRI (MRI11). The reliable change of features was determined in each patient only if the calculated RCI was over 1.96 or smaller than −1.96. The feature changes between MRI51 and MRI11 were correlated to two patient-reported quality-of-life clinical endpoints of urinary domain summary score (UDSS) and bowel domain summary score (BDSS) in 35 patients using the Spearman correlation test. Only the significant correlations between a feature that was reliably changed in ≥7 patients (20%) by RCI and an endpoint were considered as true significant correlations. Results The 352 (34.4%) and 386 (37.7%) features among all 1023 features were determined by RCI to be reliably changed in more than five (10%) patients in the CTV and PTV, respectively. Nineteen features were found reliably changed in the CTV and 31 features in the PTV, respectively, in 10 (20%) or more patients. These features were not necessarily associated with significantly different longitudinal feature values (group p-value < 0.05). Most reliably changed features in more than 10 patients had excellent or good baseline test–retest reliability ICC, while none showed poor reliability. The RCI method ruled out the features to be reliably changed when substantial feature measurement bias was presented. After applying the RCI criterion, only four and five true significant correlations were confirmed with UDSS and BDSS in the CTV, respectively, with low true significance correlation rates of 10.8% (4/37) and 17.9% (5/28). No true significant correlations were found in the PTV. Conclusions The RCI method was proposed for delta-radiomics and demonstrated using PCa MRgRT data. The RCI has advantages over some other statistical metrics commonly used in the previous delta-radiomics studies, and is useful to reliably identify the longitudinal radiomics feature change on an individual basis. This proposed RCI method should be helpful for the development of essential feature selection methodology in delta-radiomics.","Cindy Xue,Cindy Xue,Winnie Cw Chu,Winnie CW Chu,Jing Yuan,Jing Yuan,Darren M.C.

The radiomics features were extracted from plain CT and contrast-enhanced CT images. After dimensionality reduction, plain CT, multi phase enhanced CT, integrated radiomics signature models and radiomics score (Rad-score) were established and calculated. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was taken for the assessment of the model performance, and then comparison was conducted among these models. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was adopted to assess the clinical benefits of the models. Diagnostic performances including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the radiologists were evaluated.Seven, nine, fourteen, and fourteen optimal features were used to constructed plain scan, arterial phase, venous phase, and integrated radiomics signature models, respectively. ROC analysis showed these four models were able to differentiate PA from BCA and WT, with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.79, 0.90, 0.87, and 0.94 in the training set, and 0.79, 0.89, 0.86, and 0.94 in the test set, respectively. The integrated model had better diagnostic performance than single-phase radiomics model, but it had similar diagnostic performance to that of the radiomics model based on the arterial phase (p > 0.05). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in the diagnosis of PA were 0.86, 0.46, and 0.70 for the non-subspecialized radiologist and 0.88, 0.77, and 0.84 for the subspecialized radiologist, respectively. Six venous phase parameters were finally selected in differentiating WT from BCA. The predictive effect of the model was favorable, with AUC value of 0.95, sensitivity of 0.96, specificity of 0.83, and accuracy of 0.92. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in the diagnosis between WT and BCA were 0.26, 0.87, and 0.45 for the non-subspecialized radiologist and 0.85, 0.58, and 0.77 for the subspecialized radiologist, respectively.The CT-based radiomics analysis showed favorable predictive performance for differentiating PA, WT, and BCA, thus may be helpful in the clinical decision-making.","Chen Fangfang,Fang‐Fang Chen,Ge Yaqiong,Yubin Ge,Li Shuang,Shuang Li,Liu Mengqiu,Mengqiu Liu,Wu Jiaoyan,Wu Jiaoyan,Ying Liu,Liu Ying",Dentomaxillofacial Radiology,2022.0

We aimed to utilize pre- and post-treatment clinical predictors and baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomic features for establishing prognostic models to predict progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with LARC. Patients with LARC diagnosed between March 2014 and May 2016 were included in this retrospective study. A radiomic signature based on extracted MRI features and clinical prognostic models based on clinical features were constructed in the training cohort to predict 3-year PFS. C-indices were used to evaluate the predictive accuracies of the radiomic signature, clinical prognostic models, and integrated prognostic model (iPostM). In total, 166 consecutive patients were included (110 vs. 56 for training vs. validation). Eleven radiomic features were filtered out to construct the radiomic signature, which was significantly related to PFS. The MRI feature-derived radiomic signature exhibited better prognostic performance than the clinical prognostic models ( P = 0.007 vs. 0.077). Then, we proposed an iPostM that combined the radiomic signature with tumor regression grade. The iPostM achieved the highest C-indices in the training and validation cohorts (0.942 and 0.752, respectively), outperforming other models in predicting PFS (all P &amp;lt; 0.05). Decision curve analysis and survival curves of the validation cohort verified that iPostM demonstrated the best performance and facilitated risk stratification. Therefore, iPostM provided the most reliable prognostic prediction for PFS in patients with LARC.","Fei Xie,Fei Xie,Qin Zhao,Qin Zhao,Shuqi Li,Shuqi Li,Shuangshuang Wu,Shuangshuang Wu,Jinli Li,Jinli Li,Haojiang Li,Haojiang Li,Shenghuan Chen,Shenghuan Chen,Wu Jiang,Jiang Wu,Annan Dong,Annan Dong,Liqing Wu,Liqing Wu,Long Liu,Long Liu,Huabin Huang,Huabin Huang,Shuoyu Xu,Shuoyu Xu,Yuanzhi Shao,Yuanzhi Shao,Lizhi Liu,Lizhi Liu,Li Li,Li Li,Peiqiang Cai,Peiqiang Cai",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0

This retrospective study used routine clinical and US data from 205 PTC patients. According to the pathology results, the enrolled patients were divided into a non-CLNM group and a CLNM group. All patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 143) and a validation cohort (n = 62). A total of 1046 USR features of lesion areas were extracted. The features were reduced using Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with stratified 15-fold cross-validation. Several machine learning classifiers were employed to build a Clinical model based on clinical variables, a USR model based solely on extracted USR features, and a Clinical-USR model based on the combination of clinical variables and USR features. The Clinical-USR model could discriminate between PTC patients with CLNM and PTC patients without CLNM in the training (AUC, 0.78) and validation cohorts (AUC, 0.71). When compared to the Clinical model, the USR model had higher AUCs in the validation (0.74 vs. 0.63) cohorts. The Clinical-USR model demonstrated higher AUC values in the validation cohort (0.71 vs. 0.63) compared to the Clinical model.

Materials and methods In this retrospective study, 196 LNs in 61 PDAC patients were enrolled and divided into the training (137 LNs) and validation (59 LNs) cohorts. Radiomic features were extracted from portal venous phase images of LNs. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression algorithm with 10-fold cross-validation was used to select optimal features to determine the radiomics score (Rad-score). The radiological-radiomics nomogram was developed by using significant predictors of LN metastasis by multivariate logistic regression (LR) analysis in the training cohort and validated in the validation cohort independently. Its diagnostic performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), decision curve (DCA) and calibration curve analyses. Results The radiological model, including LN size, and margin and enhancement pattern (three significant predictors), exhibited areas under the curves (AUCs) of 0.831 and 0.756 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Nine radiomic features were used to construct a radiomics model, which showed AUCs of 0.879 and 0.804 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The radiological-radiomics nomogram, which incorporated the LN Rad-score and the three LNs’ radiological features, performed better than the Rad-score and radiological models individually, with AUCs of 0.937 and 0.851 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Calibration curve analysis and DCA revealed that the radiological-radiomics nomogram showed satisfactory consistency and the highest net benefit for preoperative diagnosis of LN metastasis.

In oncology, tumor heterogeneity assessment represents a pivotal step for effective treatment planning and prognosis prediction. Despite new procedures for DNA sequencing and analysis, non-invasive methods for tumor characterization are needed to impact on daily routine. On purpose, imaging texture analysis is rapidly scaling, holding the promise to surrogate histopathological assessment of tumor lesions. In this work, we propose a tree-based representation strategy for describing intra-tumor heterogeneity of patients affected by metastatic cancer. We leverage radiomics information extracted from PET/CT imaging and we provide an exhaustive and easily readable summary of the disease spreading. We exploit this novel patient representation to perform cancer subtyping according to hierarchical clustering technique. To this purpose, a new heterogeneity-based distance between trees is defined and applied to a case study of prostate cancer. Clusters interpretation is explored in terms of concordance with severity status, tumor burden and biological characteristics. Results are promising, as the proposed method outperforms current literature approaches. Ultimately, the proposed method draws a general analysis framework that would allow to extract knowledge from daily acquired imaging data of patients and provide insights for effective treatment planning.","Lara Cavinato,Lara Cavinato,Matteo Pegoraro,M.

One of the most powerful yet computationally possible algebraic techniques for measuring the topological characteristics of functions is persistent homology. It's an algebraic invariant that can capture topological details at different spatial resolutions. Persistent homology investigates the topological features of a space using a set of sampled points, such as pixels. It can track the appearance and disappearance of topological features caused by changes in the nested space created by an operation known as filtration, in which a parameter scale, in our case the intensity of pixels, is increased to detect changes in the studied space over a range of varying scales. In addition, at the level of machine learning there were many studies and articles witnessing recently the combination between homological persistence and machine learning algorithms. On another level, prostate cancer is diagnosed referring to a scoring criterion describing the severity of the cancer called Gleason score. The classical Gleason system defines five histological growth patterns (grades). In our study we propose to study the Gleason score on some glands issued from a new optical microscopy technique called SLIM. This new optical microscopy technique that combines two classic ideas in light imaging: Zernike’s phase contrast microscopy and Gabor’s holography. Persistent homology features are computed on these images. We suggested machine learning methods to classify these images into the corresponding Gleason score. Machine learning techniques applied on homological persistence features was very effective in the detection of the right Gleason score of the prostate cancer in these kinds of images and showed an accuracy of above 95%.","Abbas Rammal,Abbas Rammal,Rabih Assaf,Rabih Assaf,Alban Goupil,Alban Goupil,Mohammad Kacim,Mohammad Kacim,Valeriu Vrabie,Valériu Vrabie",BMC Bioinformatics,2022.0

Methods Multiple medical literature archives (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched to retrieve original studies focused on computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), or positron emission tomography (PET) radiomics for ovarian disorders’ assessment. Two researchers in consensus evaluated each investigation using the radiomics quality score (RQS). Subgroup analyses were performed to assess whether the total RQS varied according to first author category, study aim and topic, imaging modality, and journal quartile. Results From a total of 531 items, 63 investigations were finally included in the analysis. The studies were greatly focused (94%) on the field of oncology, with CT representing the most used imaging technique (41%). Overall, the papers achieved a median total RQS 6 (IQR, −0.5 to 11), corresponding to a percentage of 16.7% of the maximum score (IQR, 0–30.6%). The scoring was low especially due to the lack of prospective design and formal validation of the results. At subgroup analysis, the 4 studies not focused on oncological topic showed significantly lower quality scores than the others. Conclusions The overall methodological rigor of radiomics studies in the ovarian field is still not ideal, limiting the reproducibility of results and potential translation to clinical setting. More efforts towards a standardized methodology in the workflow are needed to allow radiomics to become a viable tool for clinical decision-making. Key Points • The 63 included studies using noninvasive imaging for ovarian applications were mostly focused on oncologic topic (94%). • The included investigations achieved a median total RQS 6 (IQR, −0.5 to 11), indicating poor methodological rigor. • The RQS was low especially due to the lack of prospective design and formal validation of the results.","Andrea Ponsiglione,Andrea Ponsiglione,Arnaldo Stanzione,Arnaldo Stanzione,Gaia Spadarella,Gaia Spadarella,Agah Baran,Agah Baran,Luca Alessandro Cappellini,Luca Alessandro Cappellini,Kevin Groot Lipman,Kevin Groot Lipman,Peter M.

All sequences were repeated in each scan session without moving the phantom from the table. Linear interpolation to two isotropic voxel spacing (0.9 and 4 mm) was performed as well as the ComBat feature harmonisation method between scanners. The absolute accuracy error was evaluated for the mean ADC. Repeatability and reproducibility within-subject coefficients of variation (wCV) were computed for 142 radiomic features. <h3>Results</h3> For the mean ADC, accuracy error ranged between 0.1 % and 8.5 %, repeatability was <1 % and reproducibility was <3 % for diffusivity range between 0.4 and 1.1x10<sup>-3</sup>mm<sup>2</sup>/s.

The predictive performance of the models based on radiomic features, clinical features, and their combination was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.The support vector machine (SVM) model had the highest AUC of 0.914 for classification. The clinical features model had an AUC=0.805 (95% CI 0.731-0.877) and an AUC=0.735 (95% CI 0.566-0.863) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The CT image-based ML model had an AUC=0.953 (95% CI 0.913-1.0) in the training cohort and an AUC=0.890 (95% CI 0.778-0.971) in the validation cohort. For predicting ALK rearrangement status, the ML model based on CT images and clinical features performed better than the model based on only clinical information or CT images, with an AUC of 0.965 (95% CI 0.826-0.882) in the primary cohort and an AUC of 0.914 (95% CI 0.804-0.893) in the validation cohort.Our findings revealed that ALK rearrangement status could be accurately predicted using an ML-based classification model based on CT images and clinical data.","Haiying Peng,Hao Peng,Bo-Yu Deng,Bo-Yu Deng,Cheng Huang,Chan-Tao Huang,Jun Xu,Jun Xu,Fang Zhou,Fang Zhou,Zhexing Liu,Zhe-Xing Liu,Wu Zhou,Wu Zhou,Yi-Kai Xu,Yikai Xu",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0
10.1016/j.phro.2022.10.004,36386445.0,,Predicting radiotherapy-induced xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients using day-to-day kinetics of radiomics features,"<h2>Abstract</h2><h3>Background and purpose</h3> The images acquired during radiotherapy for image-guidance purposes could be used to monitor patient-specific response to irradiation and improve treatment personalisation. We investigated whether the kinetics of radiomics features from daily mega-voltage CT image-guidance scans (MVCT) improves prediction of moderate-to-severe xerostomia compared to dose/volume parameters. <h3>Materials and Methods</h3> All patients (N=117) received 30 or more fractions of radiotherapy with daily MVCTs. Radiomics features were calculated on the contra-lateral parotid glands of daily MVCTs. Their variations over time after each complete week of treatment were considered as predictors of xerostomia and used to predict moderate-to-severe xerostomia (CTCAEv4.03 grade≥2) at 6, 12 and 24 months post-radiotherapy. After dimensionality reduction, backward/forward selection was used to generate combinations of predictors. Three types of logistic regression model were generated for each follow-up time: 1) a pre-treatment reference model using dose/volume parameters, 2) a combination of dose/volume and radiomics-based predictors, and 3) radiomics-based predictors. The models were internally validated by cross-validation and bootstrapping and their performance evaluated using Area Under the Curve (AUC) on separate training and testing sets. <h3>Results</h3> Moderate-to-severe xerostomia was reported by 46%, 33% and 26% of the patients at 6, 12 and 24 months respectively. The selected models using radiomics-based features extracted at or before mid-treatment outperformed the dose-based models with an AUC<sub>train</sub>/AUC<sub>test</sub> of 0.70/0.69, 0.76/0.74, 0.86/0.86 at 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Our results suggest that radiomics features calculated on MVCTs from the first half of the radiotherapy course improve prediction of moderate-to-severe xerostomia in HNC patients compared to a dose-based pre-treatment model.","Thomas Berger,Thomas Berger,D.

The tumor and peritumoral regions on both preoperative CT and FDG PET-CT and the vertebral bodies L3 to L5 on FDG PET were segmented to assess the tumor and bone marrow uptake, respectively. Radiomic features were extracted and combined with clinical and CT qualitative features. A random survival forest model was developed using the top-performing features to predict the time to recurrence/progression in the training cohort ( n=101 ), validated in the testing cohort ( n=34 ) using the concordance, and compared with a stage-only model. Patients were stratified into high- and low-risks of recurrence/progression using Kaplan-Meier analysis.The model, consisting of stage, three wavelet texture features, and three wavelet first-order features, achieved a concordance of 0.78 and 0.76 in the training and testing cohorts, respectively, significantly outperforming the baseline stage-only model results of 0.67 ( p<0.005 ) and 0.60 ( p=0.008 ), respectively.

Some pulmonary nodules may gradually grow and develop into lung cancer, while others may remain stable for many years. Accurately predicting the growth of pulmonary nodules in advance is of great clinical significance for early treatment. The purpose of this study was to establish a predictive model using radiomics and to study its value in predicting the growth of pulmonary nodules. Materials and methods According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 228 pulmonary nodules in 228 subjects were included in the study. During the one-year follow-up, 69 nodules grew larger, and 159 nodules remained stable. All the nodules were randomly divided into the training group and validation group in a proportion of 7:3. For the training data set, the t test, Chi-square test and Fisher exact test were used to analyze the sex, age and nodule location of the growth group and stable group. Two radiologists independently delineated the ROIs of the nodules to extract the radiomics characteristics using Pyradiomics. After dimension reduction by the LASSO algorithm, logistic regression analysis was performed on age and ten selected radiological features, and a prediction model was established and tested in the validation group. SVM, RF, MLP and AdaBoost models were also established, and the prediction effect was evaluated by ROC analysis. Results There was a significant difference in age between the growth group and the stable group (P &amp;lt; 0.05), but there was no significant difference in sex or nodule location (P &amp;gt; 0.05). The interclass correlation coefficients between the two observers were &amp;gt; 0.75. After dimension reduction by the LASSO algorithm, ten radiomic features were selected, including two shape-based features, one gray-level-cooccurence-matrix (GLCM), one first-order feature, one gray-level-run-length-matrix (GLRLM), three gray-level-dependence-matrix (GLDM) and two gray-level-size-zone-matrix (GLSZM). The logistic regression model combining age and radiomics features achieved an AUC of 0.87 and an accuracy of 0.82 in the training group and an AUC of 0.82 and an accuracy of 0.84 in the verification group for the prediction of nodule growth. For nonlinear models, in the training group, the AUCs of the SVM, RF, MLP and boost models were 0.95, 1.0, 1.0 and 1.0, respectively. In the validation group, the AUCs of the SVM, RF, MLP and boost models were 0.81, 0.77, 0.81, and 0.71, respectively. Conclusions In this study, we established several machine learning models that can successfully predict the growth of pulmonary nodules within one year. The logistic regression model combining age and imaging parameters has the best accuracy and generalization. This model is very helpful for the early treatment of pulmonary nodules and has important clinical significance.","Ran Yang,Ruifu Yang,Dongming Hui,Dongming Hui,Xing Li,Xing Li,Kun Wang,Kun Wang,Caiyong Li,Caiyong Li,Zhichao Li,Zhichao Li",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0

For each patient, 2,704 radiomic features were extracted from the primary lung cancer regions. Four procedures including the Mann–Whitney <i>U</i>-test, Spearman's correlation analysis, minimum redundancy–maximum relevance (mRMR), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) binary logistic regression were utilised for determining essential features and establishing a radiomics signature. After that, a nomogram was established. The nomogram's potential was assessed based on its discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. The radiomics signature and nomogram predictive performances were evaluated with respect to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity, accuracy, and sensitivity. <h3>Results</h3> The radiomics signature composed of eight selected features had good discriminatory performance of LNM versus non-LNM groups an AUC of 0.851 and 0.826 in primary and validation cohorts, respectively. The nomogram also indicated good discrimination with an AUC of 0.869 and 0.847 in the primary and validation cohorts, respectively.

10.3389/fneur.2022.889090,36408497.0,,Radiomics features of DSC-PWI in time dimension may provide a new chance to identify ischemic stroke,"Ischemic stroke has become a severe disease endangering human life. However, few studies have analyzed the radiomics features that are of great clinical significance for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of patients with ischemic stroke. Due to sufficient cerebral blood flow information in dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion-weighted imaging (DSC-PWI) images, this study aims to find the critical features hidden in DSC-PWI images to characterize hypoperfusion areas (HA) and normal areas (NA). This study retrospectively analyzed 80 DSC-PWI data of 56 patients with ischemic stroke from 2013 to 2016. For exploring features in HA and NA,13 feature sets ( F method ) were obtained from different feature selection algorithms. Furthermore, these 13 F method were validated in identifying HA and NA and distinguishing the proportion of ischemic lesions in brain tissue. In identifying HA and NA, the composite score (CS) of the 13 F method ranged from 0.624 to 0.925. F Lasso in the 13 F method achieved the best performance with mAcc of 0.958, mPre of 0.96, mAuc of 0.982, mF1 of 0.959, and mRecall of 0.96. As to classifying the proportion of the ischemic region, the best CS was 0.786, with Acc of 0.888 and Pre of 0.863. The classification ability was relatively stable when the reference threshold ( RT ) was &amp;lt;0.25. Otherwise, when RT was &amp;gt;0.25, the performance will gradually decrease as its increases. These results showed that radiomics features extracted from the Lasso algorithms could accurately reflect cerebral blood flow changes and classify HA and NA. Besides, In the event of ischemic stroke, the ability of radiomics features to distinguish the proportion of ischemic areas needs to be improved. Further research should be conducted on feature engineering, model optimization, and the universality of the algorithms in the future.","Yingwei Guo,Yingwei Guo,Yingjian Yang,Yingjian Yang,Fengqiu Cao,Fengqiu Cao,Yang Liu,Yang Liu,Wei Li,Wei Li,Chaoran Yang,Can Yang,Mengting Feng,Mengting Feng,Yu Luo,Yu Luo,Lei Cheng,Lei Cheng,Qiang Li,Qiang Li,Xueqiang Zeng,Xueqiang Zeng,Xiaoqiang Miao,Xiaoqiang Miao,Longyu Li,Longyu Li,Weiyan Qiu,Weiyan Qiu,Yan Kang,Yan Kang",Frontiers in Neurology,2022.0

The present work investigates the value of the application of different phase data throughout the radiotherapy process in analyzing risk of grade ≥ 2 radiation pneumonitis in stage III/IV NSCLC. Furthermore, the phase data fusion was gradually performed with the radiotherapy timeline to develop a risk assessment model.This study retrospectively collected data from 91 stage III/IV NSCLC cases treated with Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Patient data were collected according to the radiotherapy timeline for four phases: clinical characteristics, radiomics features, radiation dosimetry parameters, and hematological indexes during treatment. Risk assessment models for single-phase and stepwise fusion phases were established according to logistic regression. In addition, a nomogram of the final fusion phase model and risk classification system was generated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC), decision curve, and calibration curve analysis were conducted to internally validate the nomogram to analyze its discrimination.Smoking status, PTV and lung radiomics feature, lung and esophageal dosimetry parameters, and platelets at the third week of radiotherapy were independent risk factors for the four single-phase models. The ROC result analysis of the risk assessment models created by stepwise phase fusion were: (area under curve [AUC]: 0.67,95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-0.81), (AUC: 0.82,95%CI: 0.70-0.94), (AUC: 0.90,95%CI: 0.80-1.00), and (AUC:0.90,95%CI: 0.80-1.00), respectively. The nomogram based on the final fusion phase model was validated using calibration curve analysis and decision curve analysis, demonstrating good consistency and clinical utility. The nomogram-based risk classification system could correctly classify cases into three diverse risk groups: low-(ratio:3.6%; 0 < score < 135), intermediate-(ratio:30.7%, 135 < score < 160) and high-risk group (ratio:80.0%, score > 160).In our study, the risk assessment model makes it easy for physicians to assess the risk of grade ≥ 2 radiation pneumonitis at various phases in the radiotherapy process, and the risk classification system and nomogram identify the patient's risk level after completion of radiation therapy.","Songhua Yang,Shenghao Yang,Shixiong Huang,Shixiong Huang,Xu Ye,Xu Ye,Kun Xiong,Kun Xiong,Biao Zeng,Biao Zeng,Ying Shi,Yingrui Shi",BMC Pulmonary Medicine,2022.0

However, differences among these segmentation methods affect radiomic features to an unknown extent. A scan-rescan dataset (n = 46) of T1-weighted and diffusion tensor images was used. Subjects were split into a sleep-deprivation and a control group. Scans were segmented using four segmentation methods from which radiomic features were computed. First, we measured segmentation agreement using the Dice-coefficient. Second, robustness and reproducibility of radiomic features were measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Last, difference in predictive power was assessed using the Friedman-test on performance in a radiomics-based sleep deprivation classification application. Segmentation agreement was generally high (interquartile range = 0.77-0.90) and median feature robustness to segmentation method variation was higher (ICC > 0.7) than scan-rescan reproducibility (ICC 0.3-0.8). However, classification performance differed significantly among segmentation methods (p < 0.001) ranging from 77 to 84%. Accuracy was higher for more recent deep learning-based segmentation methods. Despite high agreement among segmentation methods, subtle differences significantly affected radiomic features and their predictive power. Consequently, the effect of differences in segmentation methods should be taken into account when designing and evaluating radiomics-based research methods.","M. G.

The 41 benign and 98 malignant nodules were proportionally (7:3) divided into training set (n = 98) and verification set (n = 41) based on gender and age of the patients. After screening, optimum efficiency towards diagnosing accidental thyroid nodules was achieved by the model constructed from 9 imaging histology features using SVM method. Specifically, the area under curve (AUC) of ROC was 0.94 in training set (95% confidence interval: 0.89–0.98), the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy were 86.9%, 89.6% and 95.2%, respectively.

10.1002/cac2.12373,36260064.0,,"The diagnosis, classification, and treatment of sarcoma in this era of artificial intelligence and immunotherapy","Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) represent a group of rare and heterogeneous tumors associated with several challenges, including incorrect or late diagnosis, the lack of clinical expertise, and limited therapeutic options. Digital pathology and radiomics represent transformative technologies that appear promising for improving the accuracy of cancer diagnosis, characterization and monitoring. Herein, we review the potential role of the application of digital pathology and radiomics in managing patients with STS. We have particularly described the main results and the limits of the studies using radiomics to refine diagnosis or predict the outcome of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. We also discussed the current limitation of implementing radiomics in routine settings. Standard management approaches for STS have not improved since the early 1970s. Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment; nonetheless, immuno-oncology agents have not yet been approved for patients with STS. However, several lines of evidence indicate that immunotherapy may represent an efficient therapeutic strategy for this group of diseases. Thus, we emphasized the remarkable potential of immunotherapy in sarcoma treatment by focusing on recent data regarding the immune landscape of these tumors. We have particularly emphasized the fact that the development of immunotherapy for sarcomas is not an aspect of histology (except for alveolar soft-part sarcoma) but rather that of the tumor microenvironment. Future studies investigating immunotherapy strategies in sarcomas should incorporate at least the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures as a stratification factor in their design, besides including a strong translational program that will allow for a better understanding of the determinants involved in sensitivity and treatment resistance to immune-oncology agents.","Amandine Crombé,Amandine Crombé,Mathtieu Roulleau‐Dugage,Mathtieu Roulleau‐Dugage,Antoîne Italiano,Antoine Italiano",Cancer communications,2022.0

However, radiomics features show a strong non-biological variability determined by different facilities and imaging protocols, limiting the reproducibility and generalizability of analysis frameworks. Our study aimed to investigate the usefulness of harmonization to reduce site-effects on radiomics features over specific brain regions. We selected T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by using the MRI dataset Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) from different sites with healthy controls (HC) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. First, the investigation of radiomics measure discrepancies were assessed on healthy brain regions-of-interest (ROIs) via a classification pipeline based on LASSO feature selection and support vector machine (SVM) model. Then, a ComBat-based harmonization approach was applied to correct site-effects. Finally, a validation step on PD subjects evaluated diagnostic accuracy before and after harmonization of radiomics data. Results on healthy subjects demonstrated a dependence from site-effects that could be corrected with ComBat harmonization. LASSO regressor after harmonization was unable to select any feature to distinguish controls by site. Moreover, harmonized radiomics features achieved an area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.77 (compared to AUC of 0.71 for raw radiomics measures) in distinguish Parkinson’s patients from HC. We found a not-negligible site-effect studying radiomics of HC pre- and post-harmonization of features. Our validation study on PD patients demonstrated a significant influence of non-biological noise source in diagnostic performances.

Their mechanism of action relies on the principle that some cancers can evade immune surveillance by expressing surface inhibitor molecules, known as ""immune checkpoints"". ICIs aim to conceal tumoral checkpoints on the cell surface and reinvigorate the ability of the host immune system to recognize tumour cells, triggering an antitumoral immune response.In this review, we will focus on the imaging patterns of different responses occurring in patients treated by ICIs. We will also discuss imaging findings of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), along with current and future perspectives of metabolic imaging.

10.1002/pros.24442,36207777.0,,Ultrasound‐based radiomics score for pre‐biopsy prediction of prostate cancer to reduce unnecessary biopsies,"Background Patients undergoing prostate biopsies (PBs) suffer from low positive rates and potential risk for complications. This study aimed to develop and validate an ultrasound (US)-based radiomics score for pre-biopsy prediction of prostate cancer (PCa) and subsequently reduce unnecessary PBs. Methods Between December 2015 and March 2018, 196 patients undergoing initial transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided PBs were retrospectively enrolled and randomly assigned to the training or validation cohort at a ratio of 7:3. A total of 1044 radiomics features were extracted from grayscale US images of each prostate nodule. After feature selection through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model, the radiomics score was developed from the training cohort. The prediction nomograms were developed using multivariate logistic regression analysis based on the radiomics score and clinical risk factors. The performance of the nomograms was assessed and compared in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. Results The radiomics score consisted of five selected features. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the radiomics score, age, total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA), and prostate volume were independent factors for prediction of PCa (all p < 0.05). The integrated nomogram incorporating the radiomics score and three clinical risk factors reached an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.835 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.729–0.941), thereby outperforming the clinical nomogram which based on only clinical factors and yielded an AUC of 0.752 (95% CI, 0.618–0.886) (p = 0.04). Both nomograms showed good calibration. Decision curve analysis indicated that using the integrated nomogram would add more benefit than using the clinical nomogram. Conclusion The radiomics score was an independent factor for pre-biopsy prediction of PCa. Addition of the radiomics score to the clinical nomogram shows incremental prognostic value and may help clinicians make precise decisions to reduce unnecessary PBs.","Wei Ou,Wei Ou,Jiahao Lei,Jiahao Lei,Minghao Li,Minghao Li,Xinyao Zhang,Xinyao Zhang,Ruiming Liang,Ruiming Liu,Lingli Long,Lingli Long,Changxuan Wang,Changxuan Wang,Lingwu Chen,Lingwu Chen,Junxing Chen,Junxing Chen,Junlong Zhang,Junlong Zhang,Zongren Wang,Zongren Wang",The Prostate,2022.0

Methods: Two radiogenomics cohorts (n = 246) were collected and tumor regions were segmented semi-automatically. A total of 174 radiomics features were extracted, and the imaging subtypes were identified and validated by unsupervised analysis. A gene-profile-based classifier was developed to predict the imaging subtypes. The prognostic differences and the biological and microenvironment characteristics of subtypes were uncovered by bioinformatics analysis. Results: Three imaging subtypes were identified and showed high reproducibility. The subtypes differed remarkably in tumor sizes and enhancement patterns, exhibiting significantly different disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) in the discovery cohort (p = 0.024) and prognosis datasets (p ranged from &lt;0.0001 to 0.0071). Large sizes and rapidly enhanced tumors usually had the worst outcomes. Associations were found between imaging subtypes and the established subtypes or clinical stages (p ranged from &lt;0.001 to 0.011). Imaging subtypes were distinct in cell cycle and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction pathways (false discovery rate, FDR &lt; 0.25) and different in cellular fractions, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (p &lt; 0.05).

The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) and Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) tools. A meta-analysis of studies on the prediction of KRAS status in colorectal cancer patients was performed.ResultTwenty-nine studies were identified in the systematic review, including three studies on the prediction of KRAS status in colorectal cancer liver metastases. All studies had an average RQS score of 9.55 (26.5% of the total score), ranging from 3 to 17. Most studies demonstrated a low or unclear risk of bias in the domains of QUADAS-2. Nineteen studies were included in the meta-analysis, mostly imaged with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), followed by computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography-CT (PET/CT). With pooled sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of the training cohorts were 0.80(95% confidence interval(CI), 0.75–0.84), 0.80(95% CI, 0.74–0.85) and 0.87(95% CI, 0.84–0.90),respectively. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC for the validation cohorts (13 studies) were 0.78(95% CI, 0.71–0.84), 0.84(95% CI, 0.74–0.90), and 0.86(95% CI, 0.83–0.89), respectively.ConclusionRadiomics is a potential noninvasive technology that has a moderate preoperative diagnosis and prediction effect on KRAS mutations. However, it has not been implemented as a clinical decision-making tool.

All malignant lymph nodes were classified as unequivocal according to RECIST criteria and confirmed by histopathology, PET-CT or follow-up imaging. Three investigators segmented lymph nodes to extract DECT and radiomics features. Intra-class correlation analysis was applied to stratify a robust feature subset with further feature reduction by Pearson correlation analysis and LASSO. Independent training and testing datasets were applied on four different machine learning models. We calculated the performance metrics and permutation-based feature importance values to increase interpretability of the models. DeLong test was used to compare the top performing models.Distance matrices and t-SNE plots revealed clearer clusters using a combination of DECT and radiomic features compared to DECT features only. Feature reduction by LASSO excluded all DECT features of the combined feature cohort. The top performing radiomic features model (AUC = 1.000; F1 = 1.000; precision = 1.000; Random Forest) was significantly superior to the top performing DECT features model (AUC = 0.942; F1 = 0.762; precision = 0.800; Stochastic Gradient Boosting) (DeLong < 0.001).Imaging biomarkers have the potential to stratify unequivocal lymph node metastases. Radiomics models were superior to DECT material decomposition and may serve as a support tool to facilitate stratification of abdominal lymph node metastases.","Scherwin Mahmoudi,Vitali Koch,Daniel Pinto dos Santos,Jörg Ackermann,Leon D.

10.1148/radiol.220715,36537895.0,,Inconsistent Partitioning and Unproductive Feature Associations Yield Idealized Radiomic Models,"Background Radiomics is the extraction of predefined mathematic features from medical images for the prediction of variables of clinical interest. While some studies report superlative accuracy of radiomic machine learning (ML) models, the published methodology is often incomplete, and the results are rarely validated in external testing data sets. Purpose To characterize the type, prevalence, and statistical impact of methodologic errors present in radiomic ML studies. Materials and Methods Radiomic ML publications were reviewed for the presence of performance-inflating methodologic flaws. Common flaws were subsequently reproduced with randomly generated features interpolated from publicly available radiomic data sets to demonstrate the precarious nature of reported findings. Results In an assessment of radiomic ML publications, the authors uncovered two general categories of data analysis errors: inconsistent partitioning and unproductive feature associations. In simulations, the authors demonstrated that inconsistent partitioning augments radiomic ML accuracy by 1.4 times from unbiased performance and that correcting for flawed methodologic results in areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve approaching a value of 0.5 (random chance). With use of randomly generated features, the authors illustrated that unproductive associations between radiomic features and gene sets can imply false causality for biologic phenomenon. Conclusion Radiomic machine learning studies may contain methodologic flaws that undermine their validity. This study provides a review template to avoid such flaws. © RSNA, 2022 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Univariate and multiple analysis method were used step by step to establish the clinical model; Then a multiview radiomics modeling scheme was designed, in which the optimal input feature set was determined by subcategorizing radiomics features (C1: original; C2: LoG and C3: wavelet) and comparison of corresponding radiomics model. The minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance (mRMR) selection and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were used for the feature selection and construction of each radiomics model (Rad). Next, an end-to-end ResNet18 architecture and transfer learning techniques were designed to construct a deep learning model (DL). Subsequently, the screened clinical risk factors and constructed Rad and DL models were combined and compared and a nomogram was constructed. Finally, the diagnostic performance of all constructed models were evaluated and compared using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, Delong test, Calibration analysis, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and decision curves, respectively.Carcinoma embryonic antigen (CEA) level and spiculation were screened to make up the Clinical model, while seven radiomics features in the optimal input feature set C2 + C3 were selected to construct the Rad. DL was constructed by training on 1.8 million natural images and small sample data of our N2 lymph node volume of interest (VOI) images. Except for the Clinical model, all other models showed good predictive accuracy and consistency in both training set and test set. DL (area under curve (AUC): 0.83) was better than Rad (AUC: 0.76) in predictive accuracy, but their difference was not significant (p = 0.45). The combined models showed better diagnostic performance than the model only clinical or image risk factors were used (AUC for Clinical, Rad + DL, Rad + Clinical, DL + Clinical, and Rad + DL + Clinical were respectively 0.66, 0.86, 0.82, 0.86, and 0.88). Finally, the Rad + DL + Clinical model with the best diagnostic performance was selected to draw the final nomogram for clinical use.This study proposes a nomogram based on multiview radiomics, deep learning, and clinical features that can be efficiently used to quantitively predict presurgical N2 diseases in patients with clinical stage I-II NSCLC.","Hanfei Zhang,Meiyan Liao,Qun Guo,Jun Chen,Shan Wang,Song-Mei Liu,Feng Xiao",,2023.0

The aim of this work is to compare the performances of survival models fed with dosiomics features and conventional DVH metrics extracted from relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted dose (DRBE) and dose-averaged Linear Energy Transfer (LETd) maps, towards the identification of possible prognostic factors for LR in SC patients treated with CIRT. This retrospective study included 50 patients affected by SC with a focus on patients that presented a relapse in a high-dose region. Survival models were built to predict both LR and High-Dose Local Recurrencies (HD-LR). The models were evaluated through Harrell Concordance Index (C-index) and patients were stratified into high/low-risk groups. Local Recurrence-free Kaplan-Meier curves were estimated and evaluated through log-rank tests. The model with highest performance (median(interquartile-range) C-index of 0.86 (0.22)) was built on features extracted from LETd maps, with DRBE models showing promising but weaker results (C-index of 0.83 (0.21), 0.80 (0.21)). Although the study should be extended to a wider patient population, LETd maps show potential as a prognostic factor for SC HD-LR in CIRT, and dosiomics appears to be the most promising approach against more conventional methods (e.g., DVH-based).","Letizia Morelli,Giovanni Parrella,S.

To develop and validate a clinical-radiomics nomogram based on clinical risk factors and CT radiomics feature to predict hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH) prognosis. Methods. A total of 195 patients with HICH treated in our hospital from January 2018 to January 2022 were retrospectively enrolled and randomly divided into two cohorts for training (n = 138) and validation (n = 57) according to the ratio of 7 : 3. All CT radiomics features were extracted from intrahematomal, perihematomal, and combined intra- and perihematomal regions by using free open-source software called 3D slicer. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method was used to select the optimal radiomics features, and the radiomics score (Rad-score) was calculated. The relationship between Rad-score, clinical risk factors, and the HICH prognosis was analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, and the clinical-radiomics nomogram was built. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the performance of the clinical-radiomics nomogram in predicting the prognosis of HICH. Results. A total of 1702 radiomics features were extracted from the CT images of each patient for analysis. By univariate and stepwise multivariate logistic regression analyses, age, sex, RBC, serum glucose, D-dimer level, hematoma volume, and midline shift were clinical risk factors for the prognosis of HICH. Rad-score and clinical risk factors developed the clinical-radiomics nomogram. The nomogram showed the highest predictive efficiency in the training cohort (AUC = 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.92 to 0.98) and the validation cohort (AUC = 0.90, 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.98). The calibration curve indicated that the clinical-radiomics nomogram had good calibration. DCA showed that the nomogram had high applicability in clinical practice. Conclusions. The clinical-radiomics nomogram incorporated with the radiomics features and clinical risk factors has good potential in predicting the prognosis of HICH.","Caiyun Fang,An Xu,Kejian Li,Juntao Zhang,Hui Shang,Tianyu Jiao,Qingshi Zeng",,2022.0

Deep learning radiomics (DLR), combining the strengths of both methods, is increasingly used in head and neck cancer (HNC). This systematic review was aimed at evaluating existing studies and assessing the potential application of DLR in HNC prognosis. Materials and methods: The PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched for articles published in the past 10 years with the keywords “radiomics,” “deep learning,” and “head and neck cancer” (and synonyms). Two independent reviewers searched, screened, and reviewed the English literature. The methodological quality of each article was evaluated with the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS). Data from the studies were extracted and collected in tables. A systematic review of radiomics prognostic prediction models for HNC incorporating deep learning techniques is presented. Result: A total of eight studies, published in 2012–2022, with a varying number of patients (59–707 cases), were included. Each study used deep learning; three studies performed automatic segmentation of regions of interest (ROI), and the Dice score range for automatic segmentation was 0.75–0.81. Four studies involved extraction of deep learning features, one study combined different modality features, and two studies performed predictive model building. The range of the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.84–0.96, the range of the concordance index (C-index) was 0.72–0.82, and the range of model accuracy (ACC) was 0.72–0.96. The median total RQS for these studies was 13 (10–15), corresponding to a percentage of 36.11% (27.78%–41.67). Low scores were due to a lack of prospective design, cost-effectiveness analysis, detection and discussion of biologically relevant factors, and external validation. Conclusion: DLR has potential to improve model performance in HNC prognosis.","Shuyan Li,Shuyan Li,Jinghua Liu,Jinghua Liu,Zhongxiao Wang,Zhongxiao Wang,Zhendong Cao,Zhendong Cao,Yifan Yang,Yifan Yang,Bingzhen Wang,Bingzhen Wang,Shiqi Xu,Shiqi Xu,Lijun Lu,Lijun Lu,M.

In oncology, tumour segmentation constitutes a crucial step of the radiomic workflow. Manual segmentation is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. In this study, a state-of-the-art deep-learning network for automatic segmentation (nnU-Net) was applied to computed tomography images of lung tumour patients, and its impact on the performance of survival radiomic models was assessed. In total, 899 patients were included, from two proprietary and one public datasets. Different network architectures (2D, 3D) were trained and tested on different combinations of the datasets. Automatic segmentations were compared to reference manual segmentations performed by physicians using the DICE similarity coefficient. Subsequently, the accuracy of radiomic models for survival classification based on either manual or automatic segmentations were compared, considering both hand-crafted and deep-learning features. The best agreement between automatic and manual contours (DICE = 0.78 ± 0.12) was achieved averaging 2D and 3D predictions and applying customised post-processing. The accuracy of the survival classifier (ranging between 0.65 and 0.78) was not statistically different when using manual versus automatic contours, both with hand-crafted and deep features. These results support the promising role nnU-Net can play in automatic segmentation, accelerating the radiomic workflow without impairing the models' accuracy.

Several innovative AI-based tools have been developed and validated in recent years that promise to accelerate the goal of real patient-tailored management. Numerous studies confirm that proper integration of AI into existing clinical workflows could bring significant benefits to women, radiologists, and healthcare systems. The AI-based approach has proved particularly useful for developing new risk prediction models that integrate multi-data streams for planning individualized screening protocols. Furthermore, AI models could help radiologists in the pre-screening and lesion detection phase, increasing diagnostic accuracy, while reducing workload and complications related to overdiagnosis. Radiomics and radiogenomics approaches could extrapolate the so-called imaging signature of the tumor to plan a targeted treatment. The main challenges to the development of AI tools are the huge amounts of high-quality data required to train and validate these models and the need for a multidisciplinary team with solid machine-learning skills. The purpose of this article is to present a summary of the most important AI applications in breast cancer imaging, analyzing possible challenges and new perspectives related to the widespread adoption of these new tools.","Maurizio Cè,Elena Caloro,Maria E.

10.1093/gastro/goac064,36457374.0,,Artificial intelligence in gastric cancer: applications and challenges.,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumors with high mortality. Accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions for GC rely heavily on human experts' careful judgments on medical images. However, the improvement of the accuracy is hindered by imaging conditions, limited experience, objective criteria, and inter-observer discrepancies. Recently, the developments of machine learning, especially deep-learning algorithms, have been facilitating computers to extract more information from data automatically. Researchers are exploring the far-reaching applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in various clinical practices, including GC. Herein, we aim to provide a broad framework to summarize current research on AI in GC. In the screening of GC, AI can identify precancerous diseases and assist in early cancer detection with endoscopic examination and pathological confirmation. In the diagnosis of GC, AI can support tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging and subtype classification. For treatment decisions, AI can help with surgical margin determination and prognosis prediction. Meanwhile, current approaches are challenged by data scarcity and poor interpretability. To tackle these problems, more regulated data, unified processing procedures, and advanced algorithms are urgently needed to build more accurate and robust AI models for GC.","Runnan Cao,Runnan Cao,Lei Tang,Lei Tang,Minghao Fang,Mengjie Fang,Lianzhen Zhong,Lianzhen Zhong,Siwen Wang,Siwen Wang,Lixin Gong,Lixin Gong,Jiazheng Li,Jiazheng Li,Di Dong,Di Dong,Jie Tian,Jie Tian",Gastroenterology report,2022.0
10.3390/biomedicines10123205,36551961.0,,Beyond Imaging and Genetic Signature in Glioblastoma: Radiogenomic Holistic Approach in Neuro-Oncology,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor exhibiting rapid and infiltrative growth, with less than 10% of patients surviving over 5 years, despite aggressive and multimodal treatments. The poor prognosis and the lack of effective pharmacological treatments are imputable to a remarkable histological and molecular heterogeneity of GBM, which has led, to date, to the failure of precision oncology and targeted therapies. Identification of molecular biomarkers is a paradigm for comprehensive and tailored treatments; nevertheless, biopsy sampling has proved to be invasive and limited. Radiogenomics is an emerging translational field of research aiming to study the correlation between radiographic signature and underlying gene expression. Although a research field still under development, not yet incorporated into routine clinical practice, it promises to be a useful non-invasive tool for future personalized/adaptive neuro-oncology. This review provides an up-to-date summary of the recent advancements in the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiogenomics for the assessment of molecular markers of interest in GBM regarding prognosis and response to treatments, for monitoring recurrence, also providing insights into the potential efficacy of such an approach for survival prognostication. Despite a high sensitivity and specificity in almost all studies, accuracy, reproducibility and clinical value of radiomic features are the Achilles heel of this newborn tool. Looking into the future, investigators’ efforts should be directed towards standardization and a disciplined approach to data collection, algorithms, and statistical analysis.","Lidia Gatto,Enrico Franceschi,Alicia Tosoni,Vincenzo Di Nunno,Caterina Tonon,Raffaele Lodi,R.

Methods A retrospective study of 136 males (mean age, 67.3 ± 8.4 years) with Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2.1 category ≤3 lesions and PSA serum levels of 4-10 ng/mL were performed. All patients underwent multiparametric MRI at 3.0T and transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic prostate biopsy in their clinical workup. Radiomic features were extracted from axial T2-weighted images (T2WI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of each patient using PyRadiomics. Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and recursive feature elimination (RFE) were implemented to identify the most significant radiomic features. Independent clinic-radiological factors were identified via univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Seven machine-learning algorithms were compared to construct a single-layered radiomic score (ie, radscore) and multivariate regression analysis was applied to construct the fusion radscore. Finally, the radiomic nomogram was further developed by integrating useful clinic-radiological factors and fusion radscore using multivariate regression analysis. The discriminative power of the nomogram was evaluated by area under the curve (AUC), DeLong test, calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA), and clinical impact curve (CIC). Results The transitional zone-specific antigen density was identified as the only independent clinic-radiological factor, which yielded an AUC of 0.592 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.527-0.657). The ADC radscore based on six features and Naive Bayes achieved an AUC of 0.779 (95%CI: 0.730-0.828); the T2WI radscore based on 13 features and Support Vector Machine yielded an AUC of 0.808 (95%CI: 0.761-0.855). The fusion radscore obtained an improved AUC of 0.844 (95%CI: 0.801-0.887), which was higher than the single-layered radscores (both P&amp;lt;0.05). The radiomic nomogram achieved the highest value among all models (all P&amp;lt;0.05), with an AUC of 0.872 (95%CI: 0.835-0.909). Calibration curve showed good agreement and DCA together with CIC confirmed the clinical benefits of the radiomic nomogram. Conclusion The radiomic nomogram holds the potential for accurate and noninvasive identification of PCa in patients with PI-RADS ≤3 lesions and PSA of 4-10 ng/mL, which could reduce unnecessary biopsy.","Yong Lu,Yangbai Lu,Binfei Li,Binfei Li,Hongxing Huang,Hongxing Huang,Qu Leng,Qu Leng,Qiang Wang,Qiang Wang,Rui Zhong,Rui Zhong,Yaqiang Huang,Yaqiang Huang,Canyong Li,Canyong Li,Runqiang Yuan,Runqiang Yuan,Yongxin Zhang,Yongxin Zhang",Frontiers in Oncology,2022.0
10.1186/s12885-022-10273-4,36447168.0,,Classification prediction of pancreatic cystic neoplasms based on radiomics deep learning models.,"Abstract Background Preoperative prediction of pancreatic cystic neoplasm (PCN) differentiation has significant value for the implementation of personalized diagnosis and treatment plans. This study aimed to build radiomics deep learning (DL) models using computed tomography (CT) data for the preoperative differential diagnosis of common cystic tumors of the pancreas. Methods Clinical and CT data of 193 patients with PCN were collected for this study. Among these patients, 99 were pathologically diagnosed with pancreatic serous cystadenoma (SCA), 55 were diagnosed with mucinous cystadenoma (MCA) and 39 were diagnosed with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). The regions of interest (ROIs) were obtained based on manual image segmentation of CT slices. The radiomics and radiomics-DL models were constructed using support vector machines (SVMs). Moreover, based on the fusion of clinical and radiological features, the best combined feature set was obtained according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) analysis. Then the fused model was constructed using logistic regression. Results For the SCA differential diagnosis, the fused model performed the best and obtained an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.916. It had a best feature set including position, polycystic features (≥6), cystic wall calcification, pancreatic duct dilatation and radiomics-DL score. For the MCA and IPMN differential diagnosis, the fused model with AUC of 0.973 had a best feature set including age, communication with the pancreatic duct and radiomics score. Conclusions The radiomics, radiomics-DL and fused models based on CT images have a favorable differential diagnostic performance for SCA, MCA and IPMN. These findings may be beneficial for the exploration of individualized management strategies.","Wenjie Liang,Wenjie Liang,Wuwei Tian,Wuwei Tian,Yifan Wang,Yifan Wang,Pan Wang,Pan Wang,Yubizhuo Wang,Yubizhuo Wang,Hongbin Zhang,Hongbin Zhang,Shijian Ruan,Shijian Ruan,Jiayuan Shao,Jiayuan Shao,Xiuming Zhang,Xiuming Zhang,Danjiang Huang,Danjiang Huang,Yong Ding,Yong Ding,Xueli Bai,Xueli Bai",BMC Cancer,2022.0

Preoperative prediction of the histologic subtypes could aid in clinical management and disease prognostication.To assess the value of radiomics based on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) in differentiating histologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian carcinoma in multicenter data sets.In this diagnostic study, 665 patients with histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian carcinoma were retrospectively recruited from 4 centers (Hong Kong, Guangdong Province of China, and Seoul, South Korea) between January 1, 2012, and February 28, 2022. The patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 532) and a testing cohort (n = 133) with a ratio of 8:2. This process was repeated 100 times. Tumor segmentation was manually delineated on each section of contrast-enhanced CT images to encompass the entire tumor. The Mann-Whitney U test and voted least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were performed for feature reduction and selection. Selected features were used to build the logistic regression model for differentiating high-grade serous carcinoma and non-high-grade serous carcinoma.Contrast-enhanced CT-based radiomics.Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of tumor segmentation were measured by Dice similarity coefficients. The diagnostic efficiency of the model was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve.In this study, 665 female patients (mean [SD] age, 53.6 [10.9] years) with epithelial ovarian carcinoma were enrolled and analyzed. The Dice similarity coefficients of intraobserver and interobserver were all greater than 0.80. Twenty radiomic features were selected for modeling. The areas under the curve of the logistic regression model in differentiating high-grade serous carcinoma and non-high-grade serous carcinoma were 0.837 (95% CI, 0.835-0.838) for the training cohort and 0.836 (95% CI, 0.833-0.840) for the testing cohort.In this diagnostic study, radiomic features extracted from contrast-enhanced CT were useful in the classification of histologic subtypes in epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of tumor segmentation was excellent. The proposed logistic regression model offered excellent discriminative ability among histologic subtypes.","Mandi Wang,Mandi Wang,Jose A U Perucho,Jose Angelo Udal Perucho,Yangling Hu,Yangling Hu,Moon Hyung Choi,Moon Hyung Choi,Lujun Han,Lujun Han,Esther M F Wong,Esther Man Fung Wong,Grace Ho,G Ho,Xiaoling Zhang,Xiaoling Zhang,Philip Ip,Philip Ip,Elaine Lee,Elaine Y P Lee",JAMA network open,2022.0

10.1155/2022/8559011,36593900.0,,Correlation Analysis of Gene and Radiomic Features in Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases,"Colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) was one of the cancers with high mortality. Clinically, the target point was determined by invasive detection, which increased the suffering of patients and the cost of treatment. If the target point was found through the relationship between early radiomic information and genetic information, it was expected to assist doctors in diagnosing disease, formulating treatment plans, and reducing the pain and burden of patients. In this study, gene coexpression analysis and hub gene mining were first performed on the gene data; secondly, quantitative radiomic features were extracted from CT-enhanced radiomic data to obtain features highly correlated with CRLM; and finally, we analyzed the relationship between gene features and radiomic feature correlations by establishing a link between early radiomic features and gene sequencing and finding highly correlated expressions. This experiment demonstrated that radiomic features could be used to mine gene attributes. Based on the four previously identified genes (NRAS, KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA), we identified two novel genes, MAPK1 and STAT1, highly associated with CRLM. There were specific correlations between these 6 genes and radiomic features (shape_elongation, glcm, glszm, firstorder_10percentile, gradient, exponent_firstorder_Range, and gradient_glszm_SmallAreaLowGrayLevel). Therefore, this paper established the correlation between radiomic features and genes, and through radiomic features, we could find the genes associated with them, which was expected to achieve noninvasive prediction of liver metastasis.","Xuehu Wang,Nie Li,Haifeng Guo,Xiaoping Yin,Yongchang Zheng",,2022.0
10.1038/s41571-022-00707-0,36443594.0,,Criteria for the translation of radiomics into clinically useful tests,"Computer-extracted tumour characteristics have been incorporated into medical imaging computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithms for decades. With the advent of radiomics, an extension of CAD involving high-throughput computer-extracted quantitative characterization of healthy or pathological structures and processes as captured by medical imaging, interest in such computer-extracted measurements has increased substantially. However, despite the thousands of radiomic studies, the number of settings in which radiomics has been successfully translated into a clinically useful tool or has obtained FDA clearance is comparatively small. This relative dearth might be attributable to factors such as the varying imaging and radiomic feature extraction protocols used from study to study, the numerous potential pitfalls in the analysis of radiomic data, and the lack of studies showing that acting upon a radiomic-based tool leads to a favourable benefit-risk balance for the patient. Several guidelines on specific aspects of radiomic data acquisition and analysis are already available, although a similar roadmap for the overall process of translating radiomics into tools that can be used in clinical care is needed. Herein, we provide 16 criteria for the effective execution of this process in the hopes that they will guide the development of more clinically useful radiomic tests in the future.","Erich P.

This study aimed to develop and validate radiomics prediction models to distinguish patients with JME from healthy controls (HCs), and to evaluate the feasibility of a radiomics approach using MRI for diagnosing JME.A total of 97 JME patients (25.6 ± 8.5 years; female, 45.5%) and 32 HCs (28.9 ± 11.4 years; female, 50.0%) were randomly split (7:3 ratio) into a training (n = 90) and a test set (n = 39) group. Radiomic features were extracted from 22 regions of interest in the brain using the T1-weighted MRI based on clinical evidence. Predictive models were trained using seven modeling methods, including a light gradient boosting machine, support vector classifier, random forest, logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting, gradient boosting machine, and decision tree, with radiomics features in the training set. The performance of the models was validated and compared to the test set. The model with the highest area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) was chosen, and important features in the model were identified.The seven tested radiomics models, including light gradient boosting machine, support vector classifier, random forest, logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting, gradient boosting machine, and decision tree, showed AUROC values of 0.817, 0.807, 0.783, 0.779, 0.767, 0.762, and 0.672, respectively.

Materials and methods A total of 356 patients (training cohort, n = 250; test cohort, n = 106) with LAGC who were confirmed T3/T4 stage by postoperative pathology were continuously collected retrospectively, including clinical data and preoperative arterial phase computed tomography images (APCT). Dedicated radiomics prototype software was used to segment the lesions and extract features from the preoperative APCT images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to select the extracted radiomics features, and a radiomics score model was constructed. Finally, a prediction model of omental metastases status and a nomogram were constructed combining the radiomics scores and selected clinical features. An area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to validate the capability of the prediction model and nomogram in the training cohort. Calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the prediction model and nomogram. The prediction model was internally validated by the test cohort. In addition, 104 patients from another hospital's clinical and imaging data were gathered for external validation. Results In the training cohort, the combined prediction (CP) model (AUC=0.871, 95% CI 0.798-0.945) of the radiomics scores combined with the clinical features, compared with clinical features prediction (CFP) model (AUC=0.795, 95% CI 0.710-0.879) and radiomics scores prediction (RSP) model (AUC=0.805, 95% CI 0.730-0.879), had the better predictive ability. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test of the CP model showed that the prediction model did not deviate from the perfect fitting ( p =0.893). In the DCA, the clinical net benefit of the CP model was higher than that of the CFP model and RSP model. In the test and validation cohorts, the AUC values of the CP model were 0.836 (95%CI 0.726-0.945) and 0.779 (95%CI 0.634-0.923), respectively.

However, patients with iodine allergy and renal dysfunction are not suitable for CAG. We try to develop a radiomics machine learning model based on rest 13N-ammonia (13N-NH3) positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) to predict coronary stenosis.Eighty-four patients were included with the inclusion criteria: adult patients; suspected CHD; resting MPI and CAG were performed; and complete data. Coronary artery stenosis >75% were considered to be significant stenosis. Patients were randomly divided into a training group and a testing group with a ratio of 1:1. Myocardial blood flow (MBF), perfusion defect extent (EXT), total perfusion deficit (TPD), and summed rest score (SRS) were obtained. Myocardial static images of the left ventricular (LV) coronary segments were segmented, and radiomics features were extracted. In the training set, the conventional parameter (MPI model) and radiomics (Rad model) models were constructed using the machine learning method and were combined to construct a nomogram. The models' performance was evaluated by area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, decision analysis curve (DCA), and calibration curves. Testing and subgroup analysis were performed.MPI model was composed of MBF and EXT, and Rad model was composed of 12 radiomics features. In the training set, the AUC/accuracy/sensitivity/specificity of the MPI model, Rad model, and the nomogram were 0.795/0.778/0.937/0.511, 0.912/0.825/0.760/0.936 and 0.911/0.865/0.924/0.766 respectively. In the testing set, the AUC/accuracy/sensitivity/specificity of the MPI model, Rad model, and the nomogram were 0.798/0.722/0.659/0.841, 0.887/0.810/0.744/0.932 and 0.900/0.849/0.854/0.841 respectively. The AUC of Rad model and nomogram were significantly higher than that of MPI model. The DCA curve also showed that the clinical net benefit of the Rad model and nomogram was similar but greater than that of MPI model. The calibration curve showed good agreement between the observed and predicted values of the Rad model. In the subgroup analysis of Rad model, there was no significant difference in AUC between subgroups.The Rad model is more accurate than the MPI model in predicting coronary stenosis.

10.3390/cancers14235931,36497415.0,,Development of Radiomic-Based Model to Predict Clinical Outcomes in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Treated with Immunotherapy,"Purpose: We aimed to assess the ability of radiomics features extracted from baseline (PET/CT0) and follow-up PET/CT scans, as well as their evolution (delta-radiomics), to predict clinical outcome (durable clinical benefit (DCB), progression, response to therapy, OS and PFS) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with immunotherapy. Methods: 83 NSCLC patients treated with immunotherapy who underwent a baseline PET/CT were retrospectively included. Response was assessed at 6–8 weeks (PET/CT1) using PERCIST criteria and at 3 months with iPERCIST (PET/CT2) or RECIST 1.1 criteria using CT. The predictive performance of clinical parameters (CP), standard PET metrics (SUV, Metabolic Tumor volume, Total Lesion Glycolysis), delta-radiomics and PET and CT radiomics features extracted at baseline and during follow-up were studied. Seven multivariate models with different combinations of CP and radiomics were trained on a subset of patients (75%) using least absolute shrinkage, selection operator (LASSO) and random forest classification with 10-fold cross-validation to predict outcome. Model validation was performed on the remaining patients (25%). Overall and progression-free survival was also performed by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. Results: Numerous radiomics and delta-radiomics parameters had a high individual predictive value of patient outcome with areas under receiver operating characteristics curves (AUCs) &gt;0.80. Their performance was superior to that of CP and standard PET metrics. Several multivariate models were also promising, especially for the prediction of progression (AUCs of 1 and 0.96 for the training and testing subsets with the PET-CT model (PET/CT0)) or DCB (AUCs of 0.85 and 0.83 with the PET-CT-CP model (PET/CT0)). Conclusions: Delta-radiomics and radiomics features extracted from baseline and follow-up PET/CT images could predict outcome in NSCLC patients treated with immunotherapy and identify patients who would benefit from this new standard. These data reinforce the rationale for the use of advanced image analysis of PET/CT scans to further improve personalized treatment management in advanced NSCLC.","Olena Tankyevych,Flora Trousset,Claire Latappy,Moran Berraho,Julien Dutilh,Jean Pierre Tasu,Corinne Lamour,Catherine Cheze Le Rest",Cancers,2022.0

However, the differentiation of GB and BM remains a major challenge in today's clinical neurooncology due to their very similar appearance in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Novel metabolic neuroimaging has proven useful for improving diagnostic performance but requires artificial intelligence for implementation in clinical routines. Here; we investigated whether the combination of radiomic features from MR-based oxygen metabolism (""oxygen metabolic radiomics"") and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can support reliably pre-therapeutic differentiation of GB and BM in a clinical setting. A self-developed one-dimensional CNN combined with radiomic features from the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) was clearly superior to human reading in all parameters for classification performance. The radiomic features for tissue oxygen saturation (mitoPO2; i.e., tissue hypoxia) also showed better diagnostic performance compared to the radiologists. Interestingly, both the mean and median values for quantitative CMRO2 and mitoPO2 values did not differ significantly between GB and BM. This demonstrates that the combination of radiomic features and DL algorithms is more efficient for class differentiation than the comparison of mean or median values. Oxygen metabolic radiomics and deep neural networks provide insights into brain tumor phenotype that may have important diagnostic implications and helpful in clinical routine diagnosis.","Andreas Stadlbauer,Gertraud Heinz,Franz Marhold,Anke Meyer-Bäse,Oliver Ganslandt,Michael Buchfelder,Stefan Oberndorfer",,2022.0

It is importance to preoperatively differentiate the histologic subtypes of EOTs. Our study aims to investigate the potential of radiomics signatures based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps for categorizing EOTs.This retrospectively enrolled 146 EOTs patients [34 with borderline EOT(BEOT), 30 with type I and 82 with type II epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC)]. A total of 390 radiomics features were extracted from DWI and ADC maps. Subsequently, the LASSO algorithm was used to reduce the feature dimensions. A radiomics signature was established using multivariable logistic regression method with 3-fold cross-validation and repeated 50 times. Patients with bilateral lesions were included in the validation cohort and a heuristic selection method was established to select the tumor with maximum probability for final consideration. A nomogram incorporating the radiomics signature and clinical characteristics was also developed. Receiver operator characteristic, decision curve analysis (DCA), and net reclassification index (NRI) were applied to compare the diagnostic performance and clinical net benefit of predictive model.For distinguishing BEOT from EOC, the radiomics signature and nomogram showed more favorable discrimination than the clinical model (0.915 vs. 0.852 and 0.954 vs. 0.852, respectively) in the training cohort. In classifying early-stage type I and type II EOC, the radiomics signature exhibited superior diagnostic performance over the clinical model (AUC 0.905 vs. 0.735). The diagnostic efficacy of the nomogram was the same as that of the radiomics model with NRI value of -0.1591 (P = 0.7268). DCA also showed that the radiomics model and combined model had higher net benefits than the clinical model.Radiomics analysis based on DWI, and ADC maps serve as an effective quantitative approach to categorize EOTs.","Yi Xu,Hong-Jian Luo,Jialiang Ren,Limei Guo,Jinliang Niu,Xiaoli Song",,2022.0

The current move to digital pathology (DP) is a fundamental change in how primary diagnostic work, consultations, education, and multidisciplinary conferences are performed. DP is the prerequisite for computational pathology (CPATH), the big-data approach to pathology that extracts information from images, typically using artificial intelligence (AI) methods. While CPATH offers significant new capabilities and workflows, it also brings new challenges. There will be knock-on effects on other specialties and in teaching and research. The emerging next-generation pathology will be more quantitative, will have more diagnostic consistency, and will be more connected to its medical peers.",Tim-Rasmus Kiehl,,2022.0
10.1007/s12070-022-03239-2,,,Exploring Radiomics for Classification of Supraglottic Tumors: A Pilot Study in a Tertiary Care Center,"Abstract Accurate classification of laryngeal cancer is a critical step for diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Radiomics is a rapidly advancing field in medical image processing that uses various algorithms to extract many quantitative features from radiological images. The high dimensional features extracted tend to cause overfitting and increase the complexity of the classification model. Thereby, feature selection plays an integral part in selecting relevant features for the classification problem. In this study, we explore the predictive capabilities of radiomics on Computed Tomography (CT) images with the incidence of laryngeal cancer to predict the histopathological grade and T stage of the tumour. Working with a pilot dataset of 20 images, an experienced radiologist carefully annotated the supraglottic lesions in the three-dimensional plane. Over 280 radiomic features that quantify the shape, intensity and texture were extracted from each image. Machine learning classifiers were built and tested to predict the stage and grade of the malignant tumour based on the calculated radiomic features. To investigate if radiomic features extracted from CT images can be used for the classification of laryngeal tumours. Out of 280 features extracted from every image in the dataset, it was found that 24 features are potential classifiers of laryngeal tumour stage and 12 radiomic features are good classifiers of histopathological grade of the laryngeal tumor. The novelty of this paper lies in the ability to create these classifiers before the surgical biopsy procedure, giving the clinician valuable, timely information.","Divya Rao,Divya Rao,K Prakashini,Prakashini Koteshwara,Rohit Singh,Rohit Singh,Vijayananda Jagannatha,J.

10.1007/978-3-031-18910-4_45,,,Human Knowledge-Guided and Task-Augmented Deep Learning for Glioma Grading,"Traditional radiomics and deep learning have been widely employed for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based glioma grading. Despite the reported promising grading performances, existing methods still have two limitations. One is that the strengths of radiomics and deep learning have not been integrated sufficiently. The other is that they cannot generalize well to different MR sequences. In this paper, we propose a human knowledge-guided and task-augmented deep learning network (HTNet) to address these issues. Particularly, radiomics handcrafted signatures are constructed to describe brain lesions and then used to guide the training of deep learning models. Furthermore, an auxiliary MRI sequence classifier is added to the original classification task to learn versatile sequence properties and thus helps the model generalize to different MR sequences without extra training cost. Extensive experiments are conducted utilizing the public dataset BraTS2020, whose results show that the proposed method has competitive capabilities in glioma grading for different MR sequences.","Yeqi Wang,Li Cheng,Yusong Lin",,2022.0

Methods: Two radiogenomic cohorts were analyzed (n = 246). Tumor regions were segmented semiautomatically, and 174 imaging features were extracted. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) were performed to identify significant imaging-pathway associations. Random forest regression was used to predict pathway enrichment scores. Five-fold cross-validation and grid search were used to determine the optimal preprocessing operation and hyperparameters. Results: We identified 43 pathways, and 101 radiomic features were significantly related in the discovery cohort (p-value &lt; 0.05). The imaging features of the tumor shape and mid-to-late post-contrast stages showed more transcriptional connections. Ten pathways relevant to functions such as cell cycle showed a high correlation with imaging in both cohorts. The prediction model for the mTORC1 signaling pathway achieved the best performance with the mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 27.29 and 28.61% in internal and external test sets, respectively. Conclusions: The DCE-MRI features were associated with hallmark activities and may improve individualized medicine for BC by noninvasively predicting pathway-level heterogeneity.","Wenlong Ming,Yanhui Zhu,Fuyu Li,Ya Mei Bai,Wanjun Gu,Yun Liu,Xiao Sun,Xiaoan Li,Hongde Liu",,2022.0

10.3389/fonc.2022.895515,36568148.0,,Machine-learning based investigation of prognostic indicators for oncological outcome of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,"Introduction Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Surgical resection remains the only potential curative treatment option for early-stage resectable PDAC. Patients with locally advanced or micrometastatic disease should ideally undergo neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgical resection for an optimal treatment outcome. Computerized tomography (CT) scan is the most common imaging modality obtained prior to surgery. However, the ability of CT scans to assess the nodal status and resectability remains suboptimal and depends heavily on physician experience. Improved preoperative radiographic tumor staging with the prediction of postoperative margin and the lymph node status could have important implications in treatment sequencing. This paper proposes a novel machine learning predictive model, utilizing a three-dimensional convoluted neural network (3D-CNN), to reliably predict the presence of lymph node metastasis and the postoperative positive margin status based on preoperative CT scans. Methods A total of 881 CT scans were obtained from 110 patients with PDAC. Patients and images were separated into training and validation groups for both lymph node and margin prediction studies. Per-scan analysis and per-patient analysis (utilizing majority voting method) were performed. Results For a lymph node prediction 3D-CNN model, accuracy was 90% for per-patient analysis and 75% for per-scan analysis. For a postoperative margin prediction 3D-CNN model, accuracy was 81% for per-patient analysis and 76% for per-scan analysis. Discussion This paper provides a proof of concept that utilizing radiomics and the 3D-CNN deep learning framework may be used preoperatively to improve the prediction of positive resection margins as well as the presence of lymph node metastatic disease. Further investigations should be performed with larger cohorts to increase the generalizability of this model; however, there is a great promise in the use of convoluted neural networks to assist clinicians with treatment selection for patients with PDAC.","Jeremy Chang,Yanan Liu,Stephanie A.

The structural covariance connectivity in the white matter remains largely unexplored. This paper aimed to build novel metrics that can infer white matter structural covariance connectivity, and to explore the predictive power of the proposed features. Methods To this end, a cohort of 315 adult subjects with the anatomical brain MRI datasets were obtained from the publicly available Dallas Lifespan Brain Study (DLBS) project. The 3D wavelet transform was applied on the individual voxel-based morphology (VBM) volume to obtain the white matter structural covariance connectivity. The predictive models for cognitive functions were built using support vector regression (SVR). Results The predictive models exhibited comparable performance with previous studies. The novel features successfully predicted the individual ability of digit comparison (DC) ( r = 0.41 ± 0.01, p &amp;lt; 0.01) and digit symbol (DSYM) ( r = 0.5 ± 0.01, p &amp;lt; 0.01). The sensorimotor-related white matter system exhibited as the most predictive network node. Furthermore, the node strengths of sensorimotor mode were significantly correlated to cognitive scores. Discussion The results suggested that the white matter structural covariance connectivity was informative and had potential for predictive tasks of brain-behavior research.","Xun-Heng Wang,Xun‐Heng Wang,Bohan Zhao,Baojun Zhao,Lihua Li,Lihua Li",Frontiers in Neuroscience,2022.0

Moreover, we evaluated a PSMA-PET/CT-based radiomic model able to identify liver metastases.Multicenter retrospective study enrolling patients with the following inclusion criteria: (a) proven CRPC patients, (b) PSMA-PET and conventional imaging/liver biopsy performed in a 6 months timeframe, (c) no therapy changes between PSMA-PET and conventional imaging/liver biopsy. PSMA-PET sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy for liver metastases were calculated. After the extraction of radiomic features, a prediction model for liver metastases identification was developed.Sixty CRPC patients were enrolled. Within 6 months before or after PSMA-PET, conventional imaging and liver biopsy identified 24/60 (40%) patients with liver metastases.

To investigate these effects, a dataset of n = 123 BMs from 99 SRS patients with 12 clinical features, 107 pre-treatment T1w-CE radiomic features, and BM progression determined by follow-up MRI was used with a random decision forest model and 250 bootstrapped repetitions. Repeat experiments assessed the relative accuracy across primary cancer sites, BM volume groups, and scanner model pairings. Correction for accuracy imbalances across volume groups was investigated by removing volume-correlated features. We found that using clinical and radiomic features together produced the most accurate model with a bootstrap-corrected area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77. Accuracy also varied by primary cancer site, BM volume, and scanner model pairings. The effect of BM volume was eliminated by removing features at a volume-correlation coefficient threshold of 0.25. These results show that feature type, primary cancer, volume, and scanner model are all critical factors in the accuracy of radiomics-based prognostic models for BM SRS that must be characterised and controlled for before clinical translation.","David A DeVries,Frank J.

10.1186/s40001-022-00877-8,36463269.0,,Prediction of distant metastasis in esophageal cancer using a radiomics–clinical model,"Abstract Background Distant metastasis, which occurs at a rate of 25% in patients with esophageal cancer (EC), has a poor prognosis, with previous studies reporting an overall survival of only 3–10 months. However, few studies have been conducted to predict distant metastasis in EC, owing to a dearth of reliable biomarkers. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an accurate model for predicting distant metastasis in patients with EC. Methods A total of 299 EC patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a training cohort ( n = 207) and a validation cohort ( n = 92). Logistic univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify clinical independent predictors and create a clinical nomogram. Radiomic features were extracted from contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images taken prior to treatment, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression was used to screen the associated features, which were then used to develop a radiomic signature. Based on the screened features, four machine learning algorithms were used to build radiomics models. The joint nomogram with radiomic signature and clinically independent risk factors was developed using the logical regression algorithm. All models were validated and compared by discrimination, calibration, reclassification, and clinical benefit. Results Multivariable analyses revealed that age, N stage, and degree of pathological differentiation were independent predictors of distant metastasis, and a clinical nomogram incorporating these factors was established. A radiomic signature was developed by a set of sixteen features chosen from 851 radiomic features. The joint nomogram incorporating clinical factors and radiomic signature performed better [AUC(95% CI) 0.827(0.742–0.912)] than the clinical nomogram [AUC(95% CI) 0.731(0.626–0.836)] and radiomics predictive models [AUC(95% CI) 0.754(0.652–0.855), LR algorithms]. Calibration and decision curve analyses revealed that the radiomics–clinical nomogram outperformed the other models. In comparison with the clinical nomogram, the joint nomogram's NRI was 0.114 (95% CI 0.075–0.345), and its IDI was 0.071 (95% CI 0.030–0.112), P = 0.001. Conclusions We developed and validated the first radiomics–clinical nomogram for distant metastasis in EC which may aid clinicians in identifying patients at high risk of distant metastasis.","Chao Zhu,Fengchun Mu,Songping Wang,Qingtao Qiu,Shuai Wang,Linlin Wang",,2022.0

Radiomics features were separately extracted from nonenhanced, arterial, and portal-venous phases CT images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression was used for feature selection. Then the radiomics signatures for each phase and a combined model of 3 phases were built. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic curves and calibration curves were used to confirm the performance of the radiomics signatures and combined model. In addition, the decision curves were performed to estimate the clinical usefulness of the combined model.The 20 most predictive features were finally selected to build radiomics signatures for each phase. The combined model achieved the overall best performance than using either of the nonenhanced, arterial and portal-venous phases alone, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.870 for ER+ versus ER-, 0.797 for PR+ versus PR-, 0.881 for HER2+ versus HER2-, and 0.726 for Ki-67. The decision curve demonstrated that the CT-based radiomics features were clinically useful.This study indicated preopreative chest CT radiomics analysis might be able to assess ER, PR, HER2+, and Ki-67 status of breast cancer.

For DCE-MRI, semi-quantitative analysis, Tofts pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling, and five-parameter sigmoid modeling were performed and parametric maps were generated. For each patient, borders of the tumors were delineated on whole tumor slices of T2-w image, ADC-map, and the late-enhancement dynamic series of DCE-MRI, creating regions-of-interest (ROIs). Radiomic analysis was performed for the specified ROIs.Among the DCE-MRI-derived parametric maps, wash-in rate (WIR) and PK-derived Ktrans parameters surpassed the accuracy of other parameters based on support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Radiomics analysis of ADC-map outperformed the T2-w and DCE-MRI techniques using the simpler classifier, suggestive of its inherently high sensitivity and specificity. Radiomics analysis of the combination of T2-w image, ADC-map, and DCE-MRI parametric maps resulted in accuracy of 100% with both classifiers with fewer numbers of selected texture features than individual images.In conclusion, radiomics analysis is a reliable quantitative approach for discrimination of parotid tumors and can be employed as a computer-aided approach for pre-operative diagnosis and treatment planning of the patients.",,,2022.0

We tested for RFs alterations of gray matter in never-treated first-episode schizophrenia (NT-FES) patients and examined their associations with known gene expression profiles. RFs were examined in the first sample with 197 NT-FES and 178 healthy controls (HCs) and validated in the second independent sample (90 NT-FES and 74 HCs). One-year follow-up data were available from 87 patients to determine whether RFs were associated with treatment outcomes. Associations between identified RFs in NT-FES and gene expression profiles were evaluated. NT-FES exhibited alterations of 30 RFs, with the greatest involvement of microstructural heterogeneity followed by measures of brain region shape. The identified RFs were mainly located in the central executive network, frontal-temporal network, and limbic system. Two baseline RFs with the involvement of microstructural heterogeneity predicted treatment response with moderate accuracy (78% for the first sample, 70% for the second sample). Exploratory analyses indicated that RF alterations were spatially related to the expression of schizophrenia risk genes. In summary, the present findings link brain abnormalities in schizophrenia with molecular features and treatment response.","Fei Zhu,Yuan Xiao,Bo Tao,Ziyang Gao,Xin Gao,Qiannan Zhao,Qi Zhang,Bing Tang,Xiaodi Zhang,Yu Zhao,Jeffrey R.

MR-PDFF and MR spectroscopy were performed on all patients using a 3.0-T scanner. Following whole-volume segmentation of the MR-PDFF images, 833 radiomic features were analyzed using a commercial program. Radiologic features were analyzed, including median and mean values of the multiple regions of interest and variable clinical features. A random forest regressor was used to extract the important radiomic, radiologic, and clinical features. The model was trained using 20 repeated 10-fold cross-validations to classify the NAFLD steatosis grade. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was evaluated using a classifier to diagnose steatosis grades.The levels of pathological hepatic steatosis were classified as low-grade steatosis (grade, 0-1; n = 82) and high-grade steatosis (grade, 2-3; n = 24). Fifteen important features were extracted from the radiomic analysis, with the three most important being wavelet-LLL neighboring gray tone difference matrix coarseness, original first-order mean, and 90th percentile. The MR spectroscopy mean value was extracted as a more important feature than the MR-PDFF mean or median in radiologic measures. Alanine aminotransferase has been identified as the most important clinical feature. The AUROC of the classifier using radiomics was comparable to that of radiologic measures (0.94 ± 0.09 and 0.96 ± 0.08, respectively).MR-PDFF-derived radiomics may provide a comparable alternative for grading hepatic steatosis in patients with suspected NAFLD.","Ki Choon Sim,Min Ju Kim,Yongwon Cho,Hyun Jin Kim,Beom Jin Park,Deuk Jae Sung,Na Han,Yeo Eun Han,Tae Hyung Kim,Yoo Jin Lee",,2022.0

This report provides an overview of the general principles of how radiomic features are computed, describes major types of morphological, first order, and texture features, and the applications, challenges, and opportunities of radiomics as applied in veterinary medicine. Some advantages radiomics has over traditional semantic radiological features include standardized methodology in computing semantic features, the ability to compute features in multi-dimensional images, their newfound associations with genomic and pathological abnormalities, and the number of perceptible and imperceptible features available for regression or classification modeling. Some challenges in deploying radiomics in a clinical setting include sensitivity to image acquisition settings and image artifacts, pre- and post-image reconstruction and calculation settings, variability in feature estimates stemming from inter- and intra-observer contouring errors, and challenges with software and data harmonization and generalizability of findings given the challenges of small sample size and patient selection bias in veterinary medicine. Despite this, radiomics has enormous potential in patient-centric diagnostics, prognosis, and theragnostics. Fully leveraging the utility of radiomics in veterinary medicine will require inter-institutional collaborations, data harmonization, and data sharing strategies amongst institutions, transparent and robust model development, and multi-disciplinary efforts within and outside the veterinary medical imaging community.","Parminder S.

Materials and methods This retrospective study enrolled 205 women with breast cancer who underwent clinicopathological examination. Among them, 93 (45%) had a low Ki-67 amplification index (Ki-67 positivity&amp;lt; 14%), and 112 (55%) had a high Ki-67 amplification index (Ki-67 positivity ≥ 14%). Radiomics features were extracted from three DCE-MRI parametric maps and ADC maps calculated from two different b values of diffusion-weighted imaging sequences. The patients were randomly divided into a training set (70% of patients) and a validation set (30% of patients). After feature selection, we trained six support vector machine classifiers by combining different parameter maps and used 10-fold cross-validation to predict the expression level of Ki-67. The performance of six classifiers was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, sensitivity, and specificity in both cohorts. Results Among the six classifiers constructed, a radiomics feature set combining three DCE-MRI parametric maps and ADC maps yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.839 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.768−0.895) within the training set and 0.795 (95% CI, 0.674−0.887) within the independent validation set. Additionally, the AUC value, compared with that for a single parameter map, was moderately increased by combining features from the three parametric maps.

We enrolled 111 patients with chest trauma who had been scanned for rib fractures at our hospital between January 2018 and December 2018 using gemstone spectral imaging (GSI). The volume of interest of each broken end of the rib fractures was segmented using calcium-based material decomposition images derived from the GSI scans. The training and testing sets were randomly assigned in a 7:3 ratio. All cases were divided into groups distinguishing the injury time at 30 and 90 days. We constructed radiomics-based models to predict the injury time of rib fractures. The model performance was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) obtained by the receiver operating characteristic analysis. We included 54 patients with 259 rib fracture segmentations (34 men; mean age, 52 years ± 12.02; and range, 19–72 years). Nine features were excluded by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression to build the radiomics signature. For distinguishing the injury time at 30 days, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and human–model collaboration resulted in an accuracy and AUC of 0.85 and 0.871 and 0.91 and 0.912, respectively, and 0.81 and 0.804 and 0.83 and 0.85, respectively, at 90 days in the testing set.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119787,,,Single-timepoint Low-dimensional Characterization and Classification of Acute versus Chronic Multiple Sclerosis Lesions using Machine Learning,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease characterized by the appearance of focal lesions across the central nervous system. The discrimination of acute from chronic MS lesions may yield novel biomarkers of inflammatory disease activity which may support patient management in the clinical setting and provide endpoints in clinical trials. On a single timepoint and in the absence of a prior reference scan, existing methods for acute lesion detection rely on the segmentation of hyperintense foci on post-gadolinium T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which may underestimate recent acute lesion activity. In this paper, we aim to improve the sensitivity of acute MS lesion detection in the single-timepoint setting, by developing a novel machine learning approach for the automatic detection of acute MS lesions, using single-timepoint conventional non-contrast T1- and T2-weighted brain MRI. The MRI input data are supplemented via the use of a convolutional neural network generating ""lesion-free"" reconstructions from original ""lesion-present"" scans using image inpainting. A multi-objective statistical ranking module evaluates the relevance of textural radiomic features from the core and periphery of lesion sites, compared within ""lesion-free"" versus ""lesion-present"" image pairs. Then, an ensemble classifier is optimized through a recursive loop seeking consensus both in the feature space (via a greedy feature-pruning approach) and in the classifier space (via model selection repeated after each pruning operation). This leads to the identification of a compact textural signature characterizing lesion phenotype. On the patch-level task of acute versus chronic MS lesion classification, our method achieves a balanced accuracy in the range of 74.3-74.6% on fully external validation cohorts.","Bastien Caba,Bastien Caba,Alexandre Cafaro,Alexandre Cafaro,Aurélien Lombard,Aurélien Lombard,Douglas L.

10.1002/mp.16132,36484346.0,,Towards reliable head and neck cancers locoregional recurrence prediction using delta‐radiomics and learning with rejection option,"A reliable locoregional recurrence (LRR) prediction model is important for the personalized management of head and neck cancers (HNC) patients who received radiotherapy. This work aims to develop a delta-radiomics feature-based multi-classifier, multi-objective, and multi-modality (Delta-mCOM) model for post-treatment HNC LRR prediction. Furthermore, we aim to adopt a learning with rejection option (LRO) strategy to boost the reliability of Delta-mCOM model by rejecting prediction for samples with high prediction uncertainties.In this retrospective study, we collected PET/CT image and clinical data from 224 HNC patients who received radiotherapy (RT) at our institution. We calculated the differences between radiomics features extracted from PET/CT images acquired before and after radiotherapy and used them in conjunction with pre-treatment radiomics features as the input features. Using clinical parameters, PET radiomics features, and CT radiomics features, we built and optimized three separate single-modality models. We used multiple classifiers for model construction and employed sensitivity and specificity simultaneously as the training objectives for each of them. Then, for testing samples, we fused the output probabilities from all these single-modality models to obtain the final output probabilities of the Delta-mCOM model. In the LRO strategy, we estimated the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties when predicting with a trained Delta-mCOM model and identified patients associated with prediction of higher reliability (low uncertainty estimates). The epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties were estimated using an AutoEncoder-style anomaly detection model and test-time augmentation (TTA) with predictions made from the Delta-mCOM model, respectively. Predictions with higher epistemic uncertainty or higher aleatoric uncertainty than given thresholds were deemed unreliable, and they were rejected before providing a final prediction. In this study, different thresholds corresponding to different low-reliability prediction rejection ratios were applied. Their values are based on the estimated epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties distribution of the validation data.The Delta-mCOM model performed significantly better than the single-modality models, whether trained with pre-, post-treatment radiomics features or concatenated BaseLine and Delta-Radiomics Features (BL-DRFs). It was numerically superior to the PET and CT fused BL-DRF model (nonstatistically significant). Using the LRO strategy for the Delta-mCOM model, most of the evaluation metrics improved as the rejection ratio increased from 0% to around 25%. Utilizing both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty for rejection yielded nonstatistically significant improved metrics compared to each alone at approximately a 25% rejection ratio. Metrics were significantly better than the no-rejection method when the reject ratio was higher than 50%.The inclusion of the delta-radiomics feature improved the accuracy of HNC LRR prediction, and the proposed Delta-mCOM model can give more reliable predictions by rejecting predictions for samples of high uncertainty using the LRO strategy.","Kai Wang,Michael Dohopolski,Qiongwen Zhang,David J.

10.1159/000528034,,,Tumor radiomic features on pretreatment MRI to predict response to lenvatinib plus an anti–PD-1 antibody in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a multicenter study,"Introduction: Lenvatinib plus an anti–PD-1 antibody has shown promising anti-tumor effects in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but with clinical benefit limited to a subset of patients. We developed and validated a radiomic-based model to predict objective response to this combination therapy in advanced HCC patients. Methods: Patients (N = 170) who received first-line combination therapy with lenvatinib plus an anti–PD-1 antibody were retrospectively enrolled from 9 Chinese centers; 124 and 46 into the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Radiomic features were extracted from pretreatment contrast-enhanced MRI. After feature selection, clinicopathologic, radiomic, and clinicopathologic-radiomic models were built using a neural network. The performance of models, incremental predictive value of radiomic features compared with clinicopathologic features and relationship between radiomic features and survivals were assessed. Results: The clinicopathologic model modestly predicted objective response with an AUC of 0.748 (95% CI: 0.656–0.840) and 0.702 (95% CI: 0.547–0.884) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The radiomic model predicted response with an AUC of 0.886 (95% CI: 0.815–0.957) and 0.820 (95% CI: 0.648–0.984), respectively, with good calibration and clinical utility. The incremental predictive value of radiomic features to clinicopathologic features was confirmed with a net reclassification index of 47.9% (P &lt; 0.001) and 41.5% (P = 0.025) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Furthermore, radiomic features were associated with overall survival and progression-free survival both in the training and validation cohorts, but modified albumin-bilirubin grade and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were not. Conclusion: Radiomic features extracted from pretreatment MRI can predict individualized objective response to combination therapy with lenvatinib plus an anti–PD-1 antibody in patients with unresectable or advanced HCC, and provide incremental predictive value over clinicopathologic features, and are associated with overall survival and progression-free survival after initiation of this combination regimen.","Bin Xu,Bin Xu,Sanyuan Dong,San-Yuan Dong,Xueli Bai,Xueli Bai,Tian-Qiang Song,Tianqiang Song,Bo-Heng Zhang,Boheng Zhang,Le-Du Zhou,Ledu Zhou,Yongjun Chen,Yong-Jun Chen,Zhiming Zeng,Zhi-Ming Zeng,Kui Wang,Kui Wang,Haitao Zhao,Hai-Tao Zhao,Na Lü,Na Lu,Wei Zhang,Wei Zhang,Xu-Bin Li,Xubin Li,Su-Su Zheng,Su-Su Zheng,Guo Long,Guo Long,Yu-Chen Yang,Yuxing Yang,Hua-Sheng Huang,Huasheng Huang,Lanqing Huang,Lan-Qing Huang,Yun-Chao Wang,Yun-Chao Wang,Fei Liang,Fei Liang,Xiao-Dong Zhu,Xiaodong Zhu,Cheng Huang,Cheng Huang,Ying-Hao Shen,Ying‐Hao Shen,Jian Zhou,Jian Zhou,Mengsu Zeng,Meng-Su Zeng,Jia Fan,Jun Fan,Sheng-Xiang Rao,Sheng-Xiang Rao,Hui–Chuan Sun,Hui-Chuan Sun",Liver cancer,2022.0

Methods This case-control single-center retrospective study included 479 lung metastases treated with RFA in 198 CRC patients. Clinical and radiological data before and intraoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were retrieved. The relative radiomics features were extracted from pre- and immediate post-RFA CT scans by maximum relevance and minimum redundancy algorithm (MRMRA). The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) was used to divide the data of the training dataset and testing dataset. In the process of modeling in the training set, radiomics model, clinical model and fusion model were built based on a random forest classifier. Finally, verification was carried out on an independent test dataset. The receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were drawn based on the obtained predicted scores, and the corresponding area under ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated and compared. Results Among the 479 pulmonary metastases, 379 had complete response (CR) ablation and 100 had incomplete response ablation. Three hundred eighty-six lesions were selected to construct a training dataset and 93 lesions to construct a testing dataset. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9, p&amp;lt;0.001) and the location of the metastases (p&amp;lt; 0.05) as independent risk factors. Significant correlations were observed between complete ablation and 9 radiomics features. The best prediction performance was achieved with the proposed multimodal data fusion model integrating radiomic features and clinical variables with the highest accuracy (82.6%), AUC value (0.921), sensitivity (80.3%), and specificity (81.4%). Conclusion This novel multimodal data fusion model was demonstrated efficient for immediate efficacy evaluation after RFA for CRC lung metastases, which could benefit necessary complementary treatment.","Huihua Huang,Zheng Dan,Hong Chen,Chao Chen,Ying Wang,Lichao Xu,Yaohui Wang,Xinhong He,Yuanyuan Yang,Wentao Li",,2023.0

Two authors independently screened all publications for eligibility. We included studies that used histopathology as a gold standard and radiomics to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of LNM in BTCs patients. The quality of the literature was evaluated using the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2). The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated to assess the predictive validity of radiomics for lymph node status in patients with BTCs. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated, and Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed to assess the causes of heterogeneity.Seven studies were included, with 977 patients. The pooled sensitivity, specificity and AUC were 83% [95% confidence interval (CI): 77%, 88%], 78% (95% CI: 71, 84) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.90), respectively. The substantive heterogeneity was observed among the included studies (I2 = 80%, 95%CI: 58,100). There was no threshold effect seen. Meta-regression showed that tumor site contributed to the heterogeneity of specificity analysis (P < 0.05). Imaging methods, number of patients, combined clinical factors, tumor site, model, population, and published year all played a role in the heterogeneity of the sensitivity analysis (P < 0.05). Subgroup analysis revealed that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based radiomics had a higher pooled sensitivity than contrast-computed tomography (CT), whereas the result for pooled specificity was the opposite.Our meta-analysis showed that radiomics provided a high level of prognostic value for preoperative LMN in BTCs patients.","Yuhu Ma,Yanyan Lin,Jiang Lu,Yulong He,Qianling Shi,Haoran Liu,Jianlong Li,Baoping Zhang,Jinduo Zhang,Yong Zhang,Ping Yue,Wenbo Meng,Xun Li",,2023.0

Among all diagnostic strategies, hippocampal atrophy is considered a promising diagnostic method. In order to proactively detect patients with early Alzheimer’s disease, we built an Alzheimer’s segmentation and classification (AL-SCF) pipeline based on machine learning. Methods In our study, we collected coronal T1 weighted images that include 187 patients with AD and 230 normal controls (NCs). Our pipeline began with the segmentation of the hippocampus by using a modified U2-net. Subsequently, we extracted 851 radiomics features and selected 37 features most relevant to AD by the Hierarchical clustering method and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm. At last, four classifiers were implemented to distinguish AD from NCs, and the performance of the models was evaluated by accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and area under the curve. Results Our proposed pipeline showed excellent discriminative performance of classification with AD vs NC in the training set (AUC=0.97, 95% CI: (0.96-0.98)). The model was also verified in the validation set with Dice=0.93 for segmentation and accuracy=0.95 for classification.

Methods A total of 148 patients with iMAD or LPA were divided into three cohorts: a training cohort (n = 72; 37 iMAD and 35 LPA), a validation cohort (n = 36; 22 iMAD and 14 LPA), and an external validation cohort (n = 40; 20 iMAD and 20 LPA). Radiomics features were extracted from contrast-enhanced and non-contrast CT images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was applied to develop a triphasic radiomics model and unenhanced radiomics model using reproducible radiomics features. A clinical model was constructed using certain laboratory variables and CT findings. Radiomics nomogram was established by selected radiomics signature and clinical factors. Nomogram performance was assessed by calibration curve, the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC), and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results Eleven and eight extracted features were finally selected to construct an unenhanced radiomics model and a triphasic radiomics model, respectively. There was no significant difference in AUC between the two models in the external validation cohort (0.838 vs. 0.843, p = 0.949). The radiomics nomogram inclusive of the unenhanced model, maximum diameter, and aldosterone showed the AUC of 0.951, 0.938, and 0.893 for the training, validation, and external validation cohorts, respectively. The nomogram showed good calibration, and the DCA demonstrated the superiority of the nomogram compared with the clinical factors model alone in terms of clinical usefulness. Conclusions A radiomics nomogram based on unenhanced CT images and clinical variables showed favorable performance for distinguishing iMAD from LPA. In addition, an efficient unenhanced model can help avoid extra contrast-enhanced scanning and radiation risk.","Hongtao Yuan,Bing Kang,Sun Kim,Songnan Qin,Chaonan Ji,Ximing Wang",,2023.0

Radiomics, or the extraction of data from various imaging modalities, is a tool often used to evaluate specific features related to the tumour or normal tissue that are not identifiable by the naked eye and which can add value to existing clinical data. Furthermore, the assessment of feature variations from one time point to another based on subsequent images, known as delta radiomics, was shown to have even higher value for treatment-outcome prediction or patient stratification into risk categories. The information gathered from delta radiomics can, further, be used for decision making regarding treatment adaptation or other interventions found to be beneficial to the patient. The aim of this work is to collate the existing studies on delta radiomics in head and neck cancer and evaluate its role in tumour response and normal-tissue toxicity predictions alike.

10.1007/s00330-022-09367-1,36604329.0,,Fetal MRI radiomics: non-invasive and reproducible quantification of human lung maturity,"To assess the reproducibility of radiomics features extracted from the developing lung in repeated in-vivo fetal MRI acquisitions.In-vivo MRI (1.5 Tesla) scans of 30 fetuses, each including two axial and one coronal T2-weighted sequences of the whole lung with all other acquisition parameters kept constant, were retrospectively identified. Manual segmentation of the lungs was performed using ITK-Snap. One hundred radiomics features were extracted from fetal lung MRI data using Pyradiomics, resulting in 90 datasets. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) of radiomics features were calculated between baseline and repeat axial acquisitions and between baseline axial and coronal acquisitions.MRI data of 30 fetuses (12 [40%] females, 18 [60%] males) at a median gestational age of 24 + 5 gestational weeks plus days (GW) (interquartile range [IQR] 3 + 3 GW, range 21 + 1 to 32 + 6 GW) were included. Median ICC of radiomics features between baseline and repeat axial MR acquisitions was 0.92 (IQR 0.13, range 0.33 to 1), with 60 features exhibiting excellent (ICC > 0.9), 27 good (> 0.75-0.9), twelve moderate (0.5-0.75), and one poor (ICC < 0.5) reproducibility. Median ICC of radiomics features between baseline axial and coronal MR acquisitions was 0.79 (IQR 0.15, range 0.2 to 1), with 20 features exhibiting excellent, 47 good, 29 moderate, and four poor reproducibility.Standardized in-vivo fetal MRI allows reproducible extraction of lung radiomics features. In the future, radiomics analysis may improve diagnostic and prognostic yield of fetal MRI in normal and pathologic lung development.• Non-invasive fetal MRI acquired using a standardized protocol allows reproducible extraction of radiomics features from the developing lung for objective tissue characterization. • Alteration of imaging plane between fetal MRI acquisitions has a negative impact on lung radiomics feature reproducibility. • Fetal MRI radiomics features reflecting the microstructure and shape of the fetal lung could complement observed-to-expected lung volume in the prediction of postnatal outcome and optimal treatment of fetuses with abnormal lung development in the future.","Florian Prayer,Martin L.

Alongside this, radiomics has experienced rapid evolution over the last several years, allowing us to correlate tumor imaging heterogeneity with a wide range of tumor molecular and subcellular features. Radiomics is a translational field focused on decoding conventional imaging data to extrapolate the molecular and prognostic features of tumors such as gliomas. We herein analyze the state-of-the-art of radiomics applied to glioblastoma, with the goal to estimate its current clinical impact and potential perspectives in relation to well-rounded patient management, including the end-of-life stage. Methods: A literature review was performed on the PubMed, MEDLINE and Scopus databases using the following search items: “radiomics and glioma”, “radiomics and glioblastoma”, “radiomics and glioma and IDH”, “radiomics and glioma and TERT promoter”, “radiomics and glioma and EGFR”, “radiomics and glioma and chromosome”. Results: A total of 719 articles were screened. Further quantitative and qualitative analysis allowed us to finally include 11 papers. This analysis shows that radiomics is rapidly evolving towards a reliable tool. Conclusions: Further studies are necessary to adjust radiomics’ potential to the newest molecular requirements pointed out by the 2021 WHO classification of CNS tumors. At a glance, its application in the clinical routine could be beneficial to achieve a timely diagnosis, especially for those patients not eligible for surgery and/or adjuvant therapies but still deserving palliative and supportive care.","Rosa Maria Gerardi,Roberto Cannella,Lapo Bonosi,Federica Vernuccio,Gianluca Ferini,Anna Viola,Valentina Zagardo,Felice Buscemi,Roberta Costanzo,Massimiliano Porzio,Evier Andrea Giovannini,Federica Paolini,Lara Brunasso,Giuseppe Roberto Giammalva,Giuseppe Emmanuele Umana,Antonino Scarpitta,Domenico Gerardo Iacopino,Rosario Maugeri",,2023.0

Despite the effective application of these treatments across a broad range of tumors, only a minority of patients have beneficial effects. The efficacy of immunotherapy is affected by several factors, including human immunity, which is strongly correlated to genetic features, such as intra-tumor heterogeneity. Classic imaging assessment, based on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is useful for conventional treatments, has a limited role in immunotherapy. The reason is due to different patterns of response and/or progression during this kind of treatment which differs from those seen during other treatments, such as the possibility to assess the wide spectrum of immunotherapy-correlated toxic effects (ir-AEs) as soon as possible. In addition, considering the unusual response patterns, the limits of conventional response criteria and the necessity of using related immune-response criteria are clear. Radiomics analysis is a recent field of great interest in a radiological setting and recently it has grown the idea that we could identify patients who will be fit for this treatment or who will develop ir-AEs.","Vincenza Granata,Roberta Fusco,Sergio Venanzio Setola,Igino Simonetti,Carmine Picone,Ester Simeone,Lucia Festino,Vito Vanella,Maria Grazia Vitale,Agnese Montanino,Alessandro Morabito,Francesco Izzo,Paolo A.

For GLCM and GLRLM features, six aggregation methods were considered. For GLSZM, GLDZM, NGTDM and NGLDM features, three aggregation methods were considered. The robustness of the features affected by aggregation methods was assessed by the pair-wise intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Furthermore, the effects of discretization and partial volume correction (PVC) on the percent of ICC categories of all texture features were evaluated by overall ICC instead of the pair-wise ICC.There were 12 features with excellent pair-wise ICCs varying aggregation methods, namely joint average, sum average, autocorrelation, long run emphasis, high grey level run emphasis, short run high grey level emphasis, long run high grey level emphasis, run length variance, SZM high grey level emphasis, DZM high grey level emphasis, high grey level count emphasis and dependence count percentage. For GLCM and GLRLM features, 19/25 and 14/16 features showed excellent pair-wise ICCs varying aggregation methods (averaged and merged) on the same dimensional features (2D, 2.5D or 3D). Different discretization levels and partial volume corrections lead to consistent robustness of textural features affected by aggregation methods.Different dimensional features with the same aggregation methods showed worse robustness compared with the same dimensional features with different aggregation methods. Different discretization levels and PVC algorithms had a negligible effect on the percent of ICC categories of all texture features.","Lihong Peng,Hui Xu,Wenbing Lv,Lijun Lu,Wufan Chen",,2023.0

Methods: Retrospectively, we included 145 consecutive subjects with NPC, 102 in the training set and 43 in the validation set. A total of 5408 initial radiomic features were acquired from the metastatic cervical lymph node's Intra and Peri areas. Then, employing multivariate logistic regression analysis, the radiomic features were chosen and integrated with clinical characteristics to create predictive models. And at last, these developed prediction models were examined using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics. Results: In the training and validation sets, there was no statistically significant variation in the AUC among the Intra radiomic signature, Peri radiomic signature, combined Intra and Peri radiomic signature, and combined Intra and Peri radiomic nomogram (all P &gt; 0.05). With an AUC of 0.941 (0.877-0.978) in the training set and 0.783 (0.631-0.894) in the validation set, the combined Intra and Peri radiomic nomogram enabled good discrimination among the responders and non-responders groups. Conclusions: The early response of metastatic cervical lymph nodes to radiochemotherapy in individuals with NPC may be predicted by pretreatment radiomic models determined by the combined Intra and Peri features from MRI imaging, facilitating therapeutic interventions and clinical decision-making.","Hao Xu,Wang Ai,Chi Zhang,Jing Ren,Jieke Liu,Peng Zhou",,2023.0

Kaplan-Meier methods was used for survival analysis. Oedematous regions were manually segmented by an expert into recurrence region, non-recurrence region. A set of 94 radiomic features were obtained from each region using the function of analyzing MR image of 3D slicer. Paired t test was performed to identify the features existing significant difference. Subsequently, the data of two patients from TCGA database was used to evaluate whether these features have clinical value.Ten features with significant differences between the recurrence and non-recurrence subregions were identified and verified on two individual patients from the TCGA database with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of GBM.Our results suggested that heterogeneity does exist in peritumoral edema, indicating that the radiomic features of peritumoral edema from routine MR images can be utilized to predict the sites of GBM recurrence.

10.1016/j.compmedimag.2023.102187,36696812.0,,MRI texture-based radiomics analysis for the identification of altered functional networks in alcoholic patients and animal models,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a complex condition representing a leading risk factor for death, disease and disability. Its high prevalence and severe health consequences make necessary a better understanding of the brain network alterations to improve diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of resting-state fMRI 3D texture features as a novel source of biomarkers to identify AUD brain network alterations following a radiomics approach. A longitudinal study was conducted in Marchigian Sardinian alcohol-preferring msP rats (N = 36) who underwent resting-state functional and structural MRI before and after 30 days of alcohol or water consumption. A cross-sectional human study was also conducted among 33 healthy controls and 35 AUD patients. The preprocessed functional data corresponding to control and alcohol conditions were used to perform a probabilistic independent component analysis, identifying seven independent components as resting-state networks. Forty-three radiomic features extracted from each network were compared using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Holm correction to identify the network most affected by alcohol consumption. Features extracted from this network were then used in the machine learning process, evaluating two feature selection methods and six predictive models within a nested cross-validation structure. The classification was evaluated by computing the area under the ROC curve. Images were quantized using different numbers of gray-levels to test their influence on the results. The influence of ageing, data preprocessing, and brain iron accumulation were also analyzed. The methodology was validated using structural scans. The striatal network in alcohol-exposed msP rats presented the most significant number of altered features. The radiomics approach supported this result achieving good classification performance in animals (AUC = 0.915 ± 0.100, with 12 features) and humans (AUC = 0.724 ± 0.117, with 9 features) using a random forest model. Using the structural scans, high accuracy was achieved with a multilayer perceptron in both species (animals: AUC > 0.95 with 2 features, humans: AUC > 0.82 with 18 features). The best results were obtained using a feature selection method based on the p-value. The proposed radiomics approach is able to identify AUD patients and alcohol-exposed rats with good accuracy, employing a subset of 3D features extracted from fMRI. Furthermore, it can help identify relevant networks in drug addiction.","Silvia Ruiz-España,Rafael Ortiz-Ramón,Úrsula Pérez-Ramírez,Antonio Díaz-Parra,Roberto Ciccocioppo,Patrick Bach,Sabine Vollstädt‐Klein,Falk Kiefer,Wolfgang Sommer,Santiago Canals,David Moratal",,2023.0

We investigated the role of MRI-based radiomics features extracted from the tumor and the peritumoral tissues to predict the risk of tumor recurrence. A total of 62 patients with biopsy-proved ER + /HER2 − breast cancer who underwent pre-treatment MRI and Oncotype Dx were included. An RS &gt; 25 was considered discriminant between low-intermediate and high risk of tumor recurrence. Two readers segmented each tumor. Radiomics features were extracted from the tumor and the peritumoral tissues. Partial least square (PLS) regression was used as the multivariate machine learning algorithm. PLS β-weights of radiomics features included the 5% features with the largest β-weights in magnitude (top 5%). Leave-one-out nested cross-validation (nCV) was used to achieve hyperparameter optimization and evaluate the generalizable performance of the procedure. The diagnostic performance of the radiomics model was assessed through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. A null hypothesis probability threshold of 5% was chosen ( p &lt; 0.05). The exploratory analysis for the complete dataset revealed an average absolute correlation among features of 0.51. The nCV framework delivered an AUC of 0.76 ( p = 1.1∙10 −3 ). When combining “early” and “peak” DCE images of only T or TST, a tendency toward statistical significance was obtained for TST with an AUC of 0.61 ( p = 0.05). The 47 features included in the top 5% were balanced between T and TST (23 and 24, respectively). Moreover, 33/47 (70%) were texture-related, and 25/47 (53%) were derived from high-resolution images (1 mm).

10.3389/fonc.2023.1117874,36776309.0,,MRI-LINAC: A transformative technology in radiation oncology,"Advances in radiotherapy technologies have enabled more precise target guidance, improved treatment verification, and greater control and versatility in radiation delivery. Amongst the recent novel technologies, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) may hold the greatest potential to improve the therapeutic gains of image-guided delivery of radiation dose. The ability of the MRI linear accelerator (LINAC) to image tumors and organs with on-table MRI, to manage organ motion and dose delivery in real-time, and to adapt the radiotherapy plan on the day of treatment while the patient is on the table are major advances relative to current conventional radiation treatments. These advanced techniques demand efficient coordination and communication between members of the treatment team. MRgRT could fundamentally transform the radiotherapy delivery process within radiation oncology centers through the reorganization of the patient and treatment team workflow process. However, the MRgRT technology currently is limited by accessibility due to the cost of capital investment and the time and personnel allocation needed for each fractional treatment and the unclear clinical benefit compared to conventional radiotherapy platforms. As the technology evolves and becomes more widely available, we present the case that MRgRT has the potential to become a widely utilized treatment platform and transform the radiation oncology treatment process just as earlier disruptive radiation therapy technologies have done.","John Ng,Fabiana Gregucci,Ryan T.

Methods: In this study, data from 164 pediatric patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) were retrospectively analyzed and patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (115) and a validation cohort (49) in a 7:3 ratio. To extract radiomics features from ultrasound images of the thyroid, areas of interest (ROIs) were delineated layer by layer along the edge of the tumor contour. The feature dimension was then reduced using the correlation coefficient screening method, and 16 features with a nonzero coefficient were chosen using Lasso. Then, in the training cohort, four supervised machine learning radiomics models (k-nearest neighbor, random forest, support vector machine [SVM], and LightGBM) were developed. ROC and decision-making curves were utilized to compare model performance, which was validated using validation cohorts. In addition, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework was applied to explain the optimal model. Results: In the training cohort, the average area under the curve (AUC) was 0.880 (0.835-0.927), 0.873 (0.829-0.916), 0.999 (0.999-1.000), and 0.926 (0.892-0.926) for the SVM, KNN, random forest, and LightGBM, respectively. In the validation cohort, the AUC for the SVM was 0.784 (0.680-0.889), for the KNN, it was 0.720 (0.615-0.825), for the random forest, it was 0.728 (0.622-0.834), and for the LightGBM, it was 0.832 (0.742-0.921). Generally, the LightGBM model performed well in both the training and validation cohorts. From the SHAP results, original_shape_MinorAxisLength,original_shape_Maximum2DDiameterColumn, and wavelet-HHH_glszm_SmallAreaLowGrayLevelEmphasis have the most significant effect on the model.

The techniques that allow machines to learn and get better at tasks such as recognition and prediction, which form the basis of clinical practice, are referred to as machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. The number of artificial intelligence-and machine learnings-related publications in clinical journals has grown exponentially, driven by recent developments in computation and the accessibility of simple tools. However, clinicians are often not included in data science teams, which may limit the clinical relevance, explanability, workflow compatibility, and quality improvement of artificial intelligence solutions. Thus, this results in the language barrier between clinicians and artificial intelligence developers. Healthcare practitioners sometimes lack a basic understanding of artificial intelligence research because the approach is difficult for non-specialists to understand. Furthermore, many editors and reviewers of medical publications might not be familiar with the fundamental ideas behind these technologies, which may prevent journals from publishing high-quality artificial intelligence studies or, worse still, could allow for the publication of low-quality works. In this review, we aim to improve readers’ artificial intelligence literacy and critical thinking. As a result, we concentrated on what we consider the 10 most important qualities of artificial intelligence research: valid scientific purpose, high-quality data set, robust reference standard, robust input, no information leakage, optimal bias-variance tradeoff, proper model evaluation, proven clinical utility, transparent reporting, and open science. Before designing a study, one should have defined a sound scientific purpose. Then, it should be backed by a high-quality data set, robust input, and a solid reference standard. The artificial intelligence development pipeline should prevent information leakage. For the models, optimal bias-variance tradeoff should be achieved, and generalizability assessment must be adequately performed. The clinical value of the final models must also be established. After the study, thought should be given to transparency in publishing the process and results as well as open science for sharing data, code, and models. We hope this work may improve the artificial intelligence literacy and mindset of the readers.","Burak Koçak,Renato Cuocolo,Daniel Pinto dos Santos,Arnaldo Stanzione,Lorenzo Ugga",,2023.0

10.2147/bctt.s398300,36776542.0,,Optimized Radiomics Nomogram Based on Automated Breast Ultrasound System: A Potential Tool for Preoperative Prediction of Metastatic Lymph Node Burden in Breast Cancer,"Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be safely avoided in women with T1 or T2 primary invasive breast cancer (BC) and one to two metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). However, cancellation of ALND based solely on SLN biopsy (SLNB) may lead to adverse outcomes. Therefore, preoperative assessment of LN tumor burden becomes a new focus for ALN status.This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram incorporating the radiomics score (rad-score) based on automated breast ultrasound system (ABUS) and other clinicopathological features for evaluating the ALN status in patients with early-stage BC preoperatively.Totally 354 and 163 patients constituted the training and validation cohorts. They were divided into ALN low burden (<3 metastatic LNs) and high burden (≥3 metastatic LNs) based on the histopathological diagnosis. The radiomics features of the segmented breast tumor in ABUS images were extracted and selected to generate the rad-score of each patient. These rad-scores, along with the ALN burden predictors identified from the clinicopathologic characteristics, were included in the multivariate analysis to establish a nomogram. It was further evaluated in the training and validation cohorts.High ALN burdens accounted for 11.2% and 10.8% in the training and validation cohorts. The rad-score for each patient was developed based on 7 radiomics features extracted from the ABUS images. The radiomics nomogram was built with the rad-score, tumor size, US-reported LN status, and ABUS retraction phenomenon. It achieved better predictive efficacy than the nomogram without the rad-score and exhibited favorable discrimination, calibration and clinical utility in both cohorts.We developed an ABUS-based radiomics nomogram for the preoperative prediction of ALN burden in BC patients. It would be utilized for the identification of patients with low ALN burden if further validated, which contributed to appropriate axillary treatment and might avoid unnecessary ALND.","Ning Li,Chao Song,Xian Huang,Hong-Jiang Zhang,Juan Su,Lichun Yang,Jingliang He,Guihua Cui",,2023.0

According to the digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) results, all patients were assigned to myocardial ischemia (n = 58) and normal myocardial blood supply (n = 52) groups. All patients were further categorized into training (n = 64) and internal validation (n = 26) sets at a ratio of 7:3, and the patients from second site were used as external validation. Clinical indicators of patients were collected, the left ventricular myocardium were segmented from CCTA images using CQK software, and the radiomics features were extracted using pyradiomics software. Independent prediction models and combined prediction models were established. The predictive performance of the model was assessed by calibration curve analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curve analysis.The combined model consisted of one important clinical factor and eight selected radiomic features. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of radiomic model was 0.826 in training set, and 0.744 in the internal validation set. For the combined model, the AUCs were 0.873, 0.810, 0.800 in the training, internal validation, and external validation sets, respectively. The calibration curves demonstrated that the probability of myocardial ischemia predicted by the combined model was in good agreement with the observed values in both training and validation sets. The decision curve was within the threshold range of 0.1-1, and the clinical value of nomogram was higher than that of clinical model.The radiomic characteristics of CCTA combined with clinical factors have a good clinical value in predicting myocardial ischemia in CHD patients.","You-Chang Yang,Yang Dou,Zhiwei Wang,Ruohan Yin,Changjie Pan,Shaofeng Duan,Xiaoqiang Tang",,2023.0
10.1186/s12891-022-06096-w,36750927.0,,Prediction of osteoporosis using radiomics analysis derived from single source dual energy CT,"With the aging population of society, the incidence rate of osteoporosis is increasing year by year. Early diagnosis of osteoporosis plays a significant role in the progress of disease prevention. As newly developed technology, computed tomography (CT) radiomics could discover radiomic features difficult to recognize visually, providing convenient, comprehensive and accurate osteoporosis diagnosis. This study aimed to develop and validate a clinical-radiomics model based on the monochromatic imaging of single source dual-energy CT for osteoporosis prediction.One hundred sixty-four participants who underwent both single source dual-energy CT and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) lumbar-spine examination were enrolled in a study cohort including training datasets (n = 114 [30 osteoporosis and 84 non-osteoporosis]) and validation datasets (n = 50 [12 osteoporosis and 38 non-osteoporosis]). One hundred seven radiomics features were extracted from 70-keV monochromatic CT images. With QCT as the reference standard, a radiomics signature was built by using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression on the basis of reproducible features. A clinical-radiomics model was constructed by incorporating the radiomics signature and a significant clinical predictor (age) using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Model performance was assessed by its calibration, discrimination and clinical usefulness.The radiomics signature comprised 14 selected features and showed good calibration and discrimination in both training and validation cohorts. The clinical-radiomics model, which incorporated the radiomics signature and a significant clinical predictor (age), also showed good discrimination, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.938 (95% confidence interval, 0.903-0.952) in the training cohort and an AUC of 0.988 (95% confidence interval, 0.967-0.998) in the validation cohort, and good calibration. The clinical-radiomics model stratified participants into groups with osteoporosis and non-osteoporosis with an accuracy of 94.0% in the validation cohort. Decision curve analysis (DCA) demonstrated that the radiomics signature and the clinical-radiomics model were clinically useful.The clinical-radiomics model incorporating the radiomics signature and a clinical parameter had a good ability to predict osteoporosis based on dual-energy CT monoenergetic imaging.","Jinling Wang,Shuwei Zhou,Suping Chen,Yewen He,Hui Gao,Luyou Yan,Xiaoli Hu,Ping Li,Haowei Shen,Muqing Luo,Tian You,Jianyu Li,Zhiheng Zhong,Kun Zhang",,2023.0

We sought to develop and validate a noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT)-based nomogram model to achieve short-term prognostic prediction for patients with HICH. We retrospectively studied 292 patients with HICH from two medical centers, and they were divided into training ( n = 151), validation ( n = 66), and testing cohorts ( n = 75). Based on radiomics, univariate and multivariate, and logistic regression analyses, four models (black hole sign, clinical, radiomics score, and combined models) were established to predict the prognosis of patients with HICH 30 days after the onset. The results suggested that the combined model had the best predictive performance with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.821, 0.816, and 0.815 in the training, validation, and testing cohorts, respectively. In addition, a radiomics-clinical (R-C) nomogram was visualized. A calibration curve analysis showed that the R-C nomogram had satisfactory calibration in the three cohorts. A decision curve analysis demonstrated that the R-C nomogram was clinically valuable. Our results suggest that the R-C nomogram can accurately and reliably predict the short-term prognosis of patients with HICH and provide a useful evaluation for making individualized treatment plans.","Jing Wang,Lu Zhou,Yuanyuan Chen,Hongli Zhou,Yuanxin Tan,Zhong Wei-jia,Zhiming Zhou",,2023.0
10.1002/mp.16233,36682051.0,,Radiomics feature analysis and model research for predicting histopathological subtypes of non‐small cell lung cancer on CT images: A multi‐dataset study,"Abstract Purpose Classifying the subtypes of non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is essential for clinically adopting optimal treatment strategies and improving clinical outcomes, but the histological subtypes are confirmed by invasive biopsy or post‐operative examination at present. Based on multi‐center data, this study aimed to analyze the importance of extracted CT radiomics features and develop the model with good generalization performance for precisely distinguishing major NSCLC subtypes: adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Methods We collected a multi‐center CT dataset with 868 patients from eight international databases on the cancer imaging archive (TCIA). Among them, patients from five databases were mixed and split to training and test sets (560:140). The remaining three databases were used as independent test sets: TCGA set ( n = 97) and lung3 set ( n = 71). A total of 1409 features containing shape, intensity, and texture information were extracted from tumor volume of interest (VOI), then the ℓ 2,1 ‐norm minimization was used for feature selection and the importance of selected features was analyzed. Next, the prediction and generalization performance of 130 radiomics models (10 common algorithms and 120 heterogeneous ensemble combinations) were compared by the average AUC value on three test sets. Finally, predictive results of the optimal model were shown. Results After feature selection, 401 features were obtained. Features of intensity, texture GLCM, GLRLM, and GLSZM had higher classification weight coefficients than other features (shape, texture GLDM, and NGTDM), and the filtered image features exhibited significant importance than original image features ( p ‐value = 0.0210). Moreover, five ensemble learning algorithms (Bagging, AdaBoost, RF, XGBoost, GBDT) had better generalization performance ( p ‐value = 0.00418) than other non‐ensemble algorithms (MLP, LR, GNB, SVM, KNN). The Bagging‐AdaBoost‐SVM model had the highest AUC value (0.815 ± 0.010) on three test sets. It obtained AUC values of 0.819, 0.823, and 0.804 on test set, TCGA set and lung3 set, respectively. Conclusion Our multi‐dataset study showed that intensity features, texture features (GLCM, GLRLM, and GLSZM) and filtered image features were more important for distinguishing ADCs from SCCs. The method of ensemble learning can improve the prediction and generalization performance on the complicated multi‐center data. The Bagging‐AdaBoost‐SVM model had the strongest generalization performance, and it showed promising clinical value for non‐invasively predicting the histopathological subtypes of NSCLC.","Fan Song,Xiao Song,Youdan Feng,Guangda Fan,Yichao Sun,Peng Zhang,Jinkai Li,Fei Liu,Guanglei Zhang",,2023.0

However, in routine clinical practice, these CT data sets are usually evaluated dominantly regarding relevant coronary artery stenosis and calcification. The implementation of radiomics analysis, which provides visually elusive quantitative information from digital images, has the potential to open a new era for cardiac CT that goes far beyond mere stenosis or calcification grade estimation. This review offers an overview of the results obtained from radiomics analyses in cardiac CT, including the evaluation of coronary plaques, pericoronary adipose tissue, and the myocardium itself.

The pGGN cases were divided into two groups: the noninvasive group and the invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) group. 330 patients were randomly assigned to the training and testing cohorts with a ratio of 7:3 (245 noninvasive lesions, 85 IAC lesions), while 52 patients (30 noninvasive lesions, 22 IAC lesions) were assigned to the external validation cohort. A model, radiomics model, and combined clinical-radiographic-radiomic model were built using the LASSO and multivariate backward stepwise regression analysis on the basis of the selected and radiomics features. The area under the curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate and compare the model performance for invasiveness discrimination among the three cohorts.Three clinical-radiographic features (including age, gender and the mean CT value) and three radiomics features were selected for model building. The combined model and radiomics model performed better than the clinical-radiographic model. The AUCs of the combined model in the training, testing, and validation cohorts were 0.856, 0.859, and 0.765, respectively. The DCA demonstrated the radiomics signatures incorporating clinical-radiographic feature was clinically useful in predicting pGGN invasiveness.The proposed radiomics-based analysis incorporating the clinical-radiographic feature could accurately predict pGGN invasiveness, providing a noninvasive biomarker for the individualized and precise medical treatment of patients.","Hui Feng,Guo‐Ming Shi,Xu Qian,Jialiang Ren,Lijia Wang,Xiao-Jia Cai",,2023.0

Surgical resection remains the only curative therapy; however, at first detection, only one-third of patients are at an early enough stage for this approach to be effective, thus rendering early diagnosis as an efficient approach to improving survival. Therefore, the identification of higher-risk patients, whose risk is correlated with genetic and pre-cancerous conditions, and the employment of non-invasive-screening modalities would be appropriate. For several at-risk patients, such as those suffering from primary sclerosing cholangitis or fibropolycystic liver disease, the use of periodic (6-12 months) imaging of the liver by ultrasound (US), magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)/cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), or computed tomography (CT) in association with serum CA19-9 measurement has been proposed. For liver cirrhosis patients, it has been proposed that at-risk iCCA patients are monitored in a similar fashion to at-risk HCC patients. The possibility of using Artificial Intelligence models to evaluate higher-risk patients could favor the diagnosis of these entities, although more data are needed to support the practical utility of these applications in the field of screening. For these reasons, it would be appropriate to develop screening programs in the research protocols setting.

10.3390/cancers15020351,36672301.0,,Risk Assessment and Pancreatic Cancer: Diagnostic Management and Artificial Intelligence,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and it is responsible for a number of deaths almost equal to its incidence. The high mortality rate is correlated with several explanations; the main one is the late disease stage at which the majority of patients are diagnosed. Since surgical resection has been recognised as the only curative treatment, a PC diagnosis at the initial stage is believed the main tool to improve survival. Therefore, patient stratification according to familial and genetic risk and the creation of screening protocol by using minimally invasive diagnostic tools would be appropriate. Pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) are subsets of lesions which deserve special management to avoid overtreatment. The current PC screening programs are based on the annual employment of magnetic resonance imaging with cholangiopancreatography sequences (MR/MRCP) and/or endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). For patients unfit for MRI, computed tomography (CT) could be proposed, although CT results in lower detection rates, compared to MRI, for small lesions. The actual major limit is the incapacity to detect and characterize the pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) by EUS and MR/MRCP. The possibility of utilizing artificial intelligence models to evaluate higher-risk patients could favour the diagnosis of these entities, although more data are needed to support the real utility of these applications in the field of screening.

Systematic literature searching was conducted in databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to November 10, 2022. Research which applied radiomics analysis on preoperative CT/MRI/PET-CT images for predicting the MSI status in CRC patients with no history of anti-tumor therapies was eligible. The radiomics quality score (RQS) and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) were applied to evaluate the research quality (full score 100%). Twelve studies with 4,320 patients were included. All studies were retrospective, and only four had an external validation cohort. The median incidence of MSI was 19% (range 8-34%). The area under the receiver operator curve of the models ranged from 0.78 to 0.96 (median 0.83) in the external validation cohort. The median sensitivity was 0.76 (range 0.32-1.00), and the median specificity was 0.87 (range 0.69-1.00). The median RQS score was 38% (range 14-50%), and half of the studies showed high risk in patient selection as evaluated by QUADAS-2. In conclusion, while radiomics based on pretreatment imaging modalities had a high performance in the prediction of MSI status in CRC, so far it does not appear to be ready for clinical use due to insufficient methodological quality.","Qiang Wang,Jiang Xu,Anrong Wang,Yi Chen,Tian Wang,Danyu Chen,Jiaxing Zhang,Torkel B.

Methods A systematic search was conducted on PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus databases to identify original studies assessing radiomics of cholangiocarcinoma on CT and/or MRI. Three readers with different experience levels independently assessed quality of the studies using the radiomics quality score (RQS). Subgroup analyses were performed according to journal type, year of publication, quartile and impact factor (from the Journal Citation Report database), type of cholangiocarcinoma, imaging modality, and number of patients. Results A total of 38 original studies including 6242 patients (median 134 patients) were selected. The median RQS was 9 (corresponding to 25.0% of the total RQS; IQR 1–13) for reader 1, 8 (22.2%, IQR 3–12) for reader 2, and 10 (27.8%; IQR 5–14) for reader 3. The inter-reader agreement was good with an ICC of 0.75 (95% CI 0.62–0.85) for the total RQS.

Phenotyping through computed tomography (CT) radiomics has the overcome the limitations of tissue-based assessment, including for TIL analysis. Here, we assess TIL enrichment objectively using an artificial intelligence-powered TIL analysis in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) image and analyze its association with quantitative radiomic features (RFs). Clinical significance of the selected RFs is then validated in the independent NSCLC patients who received ICI.In the training cohort containing both tumor tissue samples and corresponding CT images obtained within 1 month, we extracted 86 RFs from the CT images. The TIL enrichment score (TILes) was defined as the fraction of tissue area with high intra-tumoral or stromal TIL density divided by the whole TME area, as measured on an H&E slide. From the corresponding CT images, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator model was then developed using features that were significantly associated with TIL enrichment. The CT model was applied to CT images from the validation cohort, which included NSCLC patients who received ICI monotherapy.A total of 220 NSCLC samples were included in the training cohort. After filtering the RFs, two features, gray level variance (coefficient 1.71 x 10-3) and large area low gray level emphasis (coefficient -2.48 x 10-5), were included in the model. The two features were both computed from the size-zone matrix, which has strength in reflecting intralesional texture heterogeneity. In the validation cohort, the patients with high predicted TILes (≥ median) had significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared to those with low predicted TILes (median 4.0 months [95% CI 2.2-5.7] versus 2.1 months [95% CI 1.6-3.1], p = 0.002). Patients who experienced a response to ICI or stable disease with ICI had higher predicted TILes compared with the patients who experienced progressive disease as the best response (p = 0.001, p = 0.036, respectively). Predicted TILes was significantly associated with progression-free survival independent of PD-L1 status.In this CT radiomics model, predicted TILes was significantly associated with ICI outcomes in NSCLC patients. Analyzing TME through radiomics may overcome the limitations of tissue-based analysis and assist clinical decisions regarding ICI.","Changhee Park,Dong Young Jeong,Youn-Seok Choi,You Jin Oh,Jong‐Hoon Kim,Jeongun Ryu,Kyunghyun Paeng,Se‐Hoon Lee,Chan‐Young Ock,Ho Yun Lee",,2023.0

Methods: Patients with LACC (FIGO stage IB-IIIB) who underwent preoperative NACT were enrolled from center 1 (220 cases) and center 2 (independent external validation dataset, 65 cases). Handcrafted and deep learning-based radiomics features were extracted from T2WI, DWI and contrast-enhanced (CE)-T1WI, and radiomics signatures were built based on the optimal features. Two types of radiomics signatures and clinical features were integrated into the DLRN for prediction. The AUC, calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) were employed to illustrate the performance of these models and their clinical utility. In addition, disease-free survival (DFS) was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves based on the DLRN. Results: The DLRN showed favorable predictive values in differentiating responders from nonresponders to NACT with AUCs of 0.963, 0.940 and 0.910 in the three datasets, with good calibration (all p > 0.05). Furthermore, the DLRN performed better than the clinical model and handcrafted radiomics signature in all datasets (all p < 0.05) and slightly higher than the DL-based radiomics signature in the internal validation dataset (p = 0.251).

10.1002/mp.16316,36810703.0,,A combined non‐enhanced CT radiomics and clinical variable machine learning model for differentiating benign and malignant sub‐centimeter pulmonary solid nodules,"Abstract Background Radiomics has been used to predict pulmonary nodule (PN) malignancy. However, most of the studies focused on pulmonary ground‐glass nodules. The use of computed tomography (CT) radiomics in pulmonary solid nodules, particularly sub‐centimeter solid nodules, is rare. Purpose This study aims to develop a radiomics model based on non‐enhanced CT images that can distinguish between benign and malignant sub‐centimeter pulmonary solid nodules (SPSNs, &lt;1 cm). Methods The clinical and CT data of 180 SPSNs confirmed by pathology were analyzed retrospectively. All SPSNs were divided into two groups: training set ( n = 144) and testing set ( n = 36). From non‐enhanced chest CT images, over 1000 radiomics features were extracted. Radiomics feature selection was performed using the analysis of variance and principal component analysis. The selected radiomics features were fed into a support vector machine (SVM) to develop a radiomics model. The clinical and CT characteristics were used to develop a clinical model. Associating non‐enhanced CT radiomics features with clinical factors were used to develop a combined model using SVM. The performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver‐operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results The radiomics model performed well in distinguishing between benign and malignant SPSNs, with an AUC of 0.913 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.862–0.954) in the training set and an AUC of 0.877 (95% CI, 0.817–0.924) in the testing set. The combined model outperformed the clinical and radiomics models with an AUC of 0.940 (95% CI, 0.906–0.969) in the training set and an AUC of 0.903 (95% CI, 0.857–0.944) in the testing set. Conclusions Radiomics features based on non‐enhanced CT images can be used to differentiate SPSNs. The combined model, which included radiomics and clinical factors, had the best discrimination power between benign and malignant SPSNs.","Rui-Yu Lin,Yineng Zheng,Fajin Lv,B.

10.3389/fonc.2023.1066360,37007065.0,,A comprehensive nomogram combining CT-based radiomics with clinical features for differentiation of benign and malignant lung subcentimeter solid nodules,"To establish a nomogram based on non-enhanced computed tomography(CT) imaging radiomics and clinical features for use in predicting the malignancy of sub-centimeter solid nodules (SCSNs).Retrospective analysis was performed of records for 198 patients with SCSNs that were surgically resected and examined pathologically at two medical institutions between January 2020 and June 2021. Patients from Center 1 were included in the training cohort (n = 147), and patients from Center 2 were included in the external validation cohort (n = 52). Radiomic features were extracted from chest CT images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used for radiomic feature extraction and computation of radiomic scores. Clinical features, subjective CT findings, and radiomic scores were used to build multiple predictive models. Model performance was examined by evaluating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The best model was selected for efficacy evaluation in a validation cohort, and column line plots were created.Pulmonary malignant nodules were significantly associated with vascular alterations in both the training (p < 0.001) and external validation (p < 0.001) cohorts. Eleven radiomic features were selected after a dimensionality reduction to calculate the radiomic scores. Based on these findings, three prediction models were constructed: subjective model (Model 1), radiomic score model (Model 2), and comprehensive model (Model 3), with AUCs of 0.672, 0.888, and 0.930, respectively. The optimal model with an AUC of 0.905 was applied to the validation cohort, and decision curve analysis indicated that the comprehensive model column line plot was clinically useful.Predictive models constructed based on CT-based radiomics with clinical features can help clinicians diagnose pulmonary nodules and guide clinical decision making.","Chengyu Chen,Qun Geng,Gesheng Song,Qian Zhang,Youruo Wang,Dawei Sun,Qingshi Zeng,Zhengjun Dai,Gongchao Wang",,2023.0
10.3389/fnume.2023.1078536,,,A heterogeneous phantom study for investigating the stability of PET images radiomic features with varying reconstruction settings,"The purpose of this work was to assess the capability of radiomic features in distinguishing PET image regions with different uptake patterns. Furthermore, we assessed the stability of PET radiomic features with varying image reconstruction settings. An in-house phantom was designed and constructed, consisting of homogenous and heterogenous artificial phantom inserts. Four artificially constructed inserts were placed into a water filled phantom and filled with varying levels of radioactivity to simulate homogeneous and heterogeneous uptake patterns. The phantom was imaged for 80 min. PET images were reconstructed whilst varying reconstruction parameters. The parameters adjusted included, number of ordered subsets, number of iterations, use of time-of-flight and filter cut off. Regions of interest (ROI) were established by segmentation of the phantom inserts from the reconstructed images. In total seventy eight 3D radiomic features for each ROI with unique reconstructed parameters were extracted. The Friedman test was used to determine the statistical power of each radiomic feature in differentiating phantom inserts with different hetero/homogeneous configurations. The Coefficient of Variation (COV) of each feature, with respect to the reconstruction setting was used to determine feature stability. Forty three out of seventy eight radiomic features were found to be stable (COV <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""IM1""><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo></mml:math> 5%) against all reconstruction settings. To provide any utility, stable features are required to differentiate between regions with different hetro/homogeneity. Of the forty three stable features, fifteen (35%) features showed a statistically significant difference between the artificially constructed inserts. Such features included GLCM (Difference average, Difference entropy, Dissimilarity and Inverse difference), GLRL (Long run emphasis, Grey level non uniformity and Run percentage) and NGTDM (Complexity and Strength). The finding of this work suggests that radiomic features are capable of distinguishing between radioactive distribution patterns that demonstrate different levels of heterogeneity. Therefore, radiomic features could serve as an adjuvant diagnostic tool along with traditional imaging. However, the choice of the radiomic features needs to account for variability introduced when different reconstruction settings are used. Standardization of PET image reconstruction settings across sites performing radiomic analysis in multi-centre trials should be considered.","Emad Alsyed,Rodney Smith,Lee Bartley,Christopher Marshall,Emiliano Spezi",,2023.0
10.1088/1361-6560/acbadf,36758241.0,,A multi-objective based radiomics feature selection method for response prediction following radiotherapy,"Objective.Radiomics contains a large amount of mineable information extracted from medical images, which has important significance in treatment response prediction for personalized treatment. Radiomics analyses generally involve high dimensions and redundant features, feature selection is essential for construction of prediction models.Approach.We proposed a novel multi-objective based radiomics feature selection method (MRMOPSO), where the number of features, sensitivity, and specificity are jointly considered as optimization objectives in feature selection. The MRMOPSO innovated in the following three aspects: (1) Fisher score to initialize the population to speed up the convergence; (2) Min-redundancy particle generation operations to reduce the redundancy between radiomics features, a truncation strategy was introduced to further reduce the number of features effectively; (3) Particle selection operations guided by elitism strategies to improve local search ability of the algorithm. We evaluated the effectiveness of the MRMOPSO by using a multi-institution oropharyngeal cancer dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive. 357 patients were used for model training and cross validation, an additional 64 patients were used for evaluation.Main results.The area under the curve (AUC) of our method achieved AUCs of 0.82 and 0.84 for cross validation and independent dataset, respectively. Compared with classical feature selection methods, the AUC of MRMOPSO is significantly higher than the Lasso (AUC = 0.74,p-value = 0.02), minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMR) (AUC = 0.73,p-value = 0.05), F-score (AUC = 0.48,p-value < 0.01), and mutual information (AUC = 0.69,p-value < 0.01) methods. Compared to single-objective methods, the AUC of MRMOPSO is 12% higher than those of the genetic algorithm (GA) (AUC = 0.68,p-value = 0.02) and particle swarm optimization algorithm (AUC = 0.72,p-value = 0.05) methods. Compared to other multi-objective feature selection methods, the AUC of MRMOPSO is 14% higher than those of multiple objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) (AUC = 0.68,p-value = 0.02) and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA2) (AUC = 0.70,p-value = 0.03).Significance.We proposed a multi-objective based radiomics feature selection method. Compared to conventional feature reduction algorithms, the proposed algorithm effectively reduced feature dimension, and achieved superior performance, with improved sensitivity and specificity, for response prediction in radiotherapy.","Xiaoying Pan,Chen Liu,Tianhao Feng,S Qi",,2023.0

However, some patients fail to benefit from methylprednisolone or even progress. This study aimed to develop and validate a radiomic model to predict the response to methylprednisolone in RN.Sixty-six patients receiving methylprednisolone were enrolled. In total, 961 radiomic features were extracted from the pre-treatment magnetic resonance imagings of the brain. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was then applied to construct the radiomics signature. Combined with independent clinical predictors, a radiomics model was built with multivariate logistic regression analysis. Discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness of the model were assessed. The model was internally validated using 10-fold cross-validation.The radiomics signature consisted of 16 selected features and achieved favorable discrimination performance. The radiomics model incorporating the radiomics signature and the duration between radiotherapy and RN diagnosis, yielded an AUC of 0.966 and an optimism-corrected AUC of 0.967 via 10-fold cross-validation, which also revealed good discrimination. Calibration curves showed good agreement. Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of the model.The presented radiomics model can be conveniently used to facilitate individualized prediction of the response to methylprednisolone in patients with RN.","Xiaohuang Zhuo,Huiying Zhao,Meiwei Chen,Youqing Mu,Yi Li,Jinhua Cai,Honghong Li,Yongteng Xu,Yamei Tang",,2023.0

A hypothesis‐generating study,"The rate of physiological bone remodelling (PBR) occurring after implant placement has been associated with the later onset of progressive bone loss and peri-implantitis, leading to medium- and long-term implant therapy failure. It is still questionable, however, whether PBR is associated with specific bone characteristics. The aim of this study was to assess whether radiomic analysis could reveal not readily appreciable bone features useful for the prediction of PBR.Radiomic features were extracted from the radiographs taken at implant placement (T0) using LifeX software. Because of the multi-centre design of the source study, ComBat harmonization was applied to the cohort. Different machine-learning models were trained on selected radiomic features to develop and internally validate algorithms capable of predicting high PBR. In addition, results of the algorithm were included in a multivariate analysis with other clinical variables (tissue thickness and depth of implant position) to test their independent correlation with PBR.Specific radiomic features extracted at T0 are associated with higher PBR around tissue-level implants after 3 months of unsubmerged healing (T1). In addition, taking advantage of machine-learning methods, a naive Bayes model was trained using radiomic features selected by fast correlation-based filter (FCBF), which showed the best performance in the prediction of PBR (AUC = 0.751, sensitivity = 66.0%, specificity = 68.4%, positive predictive value = 73.3%, negative predictive value = 60.5%). In addition, results of the whole model were included in a multivariate analysis with tissue thickness and depth of implant position, which were still found to be independently associated with PBR (p-value < .01).The combination of radiomics and machine-learning methods seems to be a promising approach for the early prediction of PBR. Such an innovative approach could be also used for the study of not readily disclosed bone characteristics, thus helping to explain not fully understood clinical phenomena. Although promising, the performance of the radiomic model should be improved in terms of specificity and sensitivity by further studies in this field.","Giuseppe Troiano,Francesco Fanelli,Antonio Rapani,Matteo Zotti,Teresa Lombardi,Khrystyna Zhurakivska,Claudio Stacchi",,2023.0

Early diagnosis and screening of cirrhotic patients at risk for EGVB is crucial. Currently, there is a lack of noninvasive predictive models widely available in clinical practice.To develop a nomogram based on clinical variables and radiomics to facilitate the noninvasive prediction of EGVB in cirrhotic patients.A total of 211 cirrhotic patients hospitalized between September 2017 and December 2021 were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into training (n = 149) and validation (n = 62) groups at a 7:3 ratio. Participants underwent three-phase computed tomography (CT) scans before endoscopy, and radiomic features were extracted from portal venous phase CT images. The independent sample t-test and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression were used to screen out the best features and establish a radiomics signature (RadScore). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the independent predictors of EGVB in clinical settings. A noninvasive predictive nomogram for the risk of EGVB was built using independent clinical predictors and RadScore. Receiver operating characteristic, calibration, clinical decision, and clinical impact curves were applied to evaluate the model's performance.Albumin (P = 0.001), fibrinogen (P = 0.001), portal vein thrombosis (P = 0.002), aspartate aminotransferase (P = 0.001), and spleen thickness (P = 0.025) were selected as independent clinical predictors of EGVB. RadScore, constructed with five CT features of the liver region and three of the spleen regions, performed well in training (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.817) as well as in validation (AUC = 0.741) cohorts. There was excellent predictive performance in both the training and validation cohorts for the clinical-radiomics model (AUC = 0.925 and 0.912, respectively). Compared with the existing noninvasive models such as ratio of aspartate aminotransferase to platelets and Fibrosis-4 scores, our combined model had better predictive accuracy with the Delong's test less than 0.05. The Nomogram had a good fit in the calibration curve (P > 0.05), and the clinical decision curve further supported its clinical utility.We designed and validated a clinical-radiomics nomogram able to noninvasively predict whether cirrhotic patients will develop EGVB, thus facilitating early diagnosis and treatment.","Rui Luo,Jian Gao,Weiqun Gan,Weibo Xie",,2023.0

In the liver metastases patients, the possibility to assess mutational status (RAS or MSI), the tumor growth pattern and the histological subtype (NOS or mucinous) allows a better treatment selection to avoid unnecessary therapies. However, today, the detection of these features require an invasive approach. Recently, radiomics analysis application has improved rapidly, with a consequent growing interest in the oncological field. Radiomics analysis allows the textural characteristics assessment, which are correlated to biological data. This approach is captivating since it should allow to extract biological data from the radiological images, without invasive approach, so that to reduce costs and time, avoiding any risk for the patients. Several studies showed the ability of Radiomics to identify mutational status, tumor growth pattern and histological type in colorectal liver metastases. Although, radiomics analysis in a non-invasive and repeatable way, however features as the poor standardization and generalization of clinical studies results limit the translation of this analysis into clinical practice. Clear limits are data-quality control, reproducibility, repeatability, generalizability of results, and issues related to model overfitting.","Vincenza Granata,Roberta Fusco,Sergio Venanzio Setola,Roberta Galdiero,Nicola Maggialetti,Renato Patrone,Alessandro Ottaiano,Guglielmo Nasti,Lucrezia Silvestro,Antonio Cassata,Francesca Grassi,Antonio Avallone,Francesco Izzo,Antonella Petrillo",,2023.0

Volumes of interest (2.5 cm 3 ) were placed in 3 disease-free tissues with visually similar appearance on T1 Dixon water images: liver, spleen, and paraspinal muscle. Gray-level histogram (GLH), gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), gray-level run-length matrix (GLRLM), and gray-level size-zone matrix (GLSZM) radiomic features were extracted. Tissue classification was performed on pooled data from the 2 centers (1) without harmonization, (2) after ComBat harmonization with empirical Bayes estimation (ComBat-B), and (3) after ComBat harmonization without empirical Bayes estimation (ComBat-NB). Linear discriminant analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation was used to distinguish among the 3 tissue types, using all available radiomic features as input. In addition, a multilayer perceptron neural network with a random 70%:30% split into training and test data sets was used for the same task, but separately for each radiomic feature category.Linear discriminant analysis-based mean tissue classification accuracies were 52.3% for unharmonized, 66.3% for ComBat-B harmonized, and 92.7% for ComBat-NB harmonized data. For multilayer perceptron neural network, mean classification accuracies for unharmonized, ComBat-B-harmonized, and ComBat-NB-harmonized test data were as follows: 46.8%, 55.1%, and 57.5% for GLH; 42.0%, 65.3%, and 71.0% for GLCM; 45.3%, 78.3%, and 78.0% for GLRLM; and 48.1%, 81.1%, and 89.4% for GLSZM.

There are few studies on myocardial texture based on echocardiography. Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptive machine learning method based on ultrasonic image texture features to identify CA. In this retrospective study, a total of 289 participants (50 cases of myocardial amyloidosis; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: 70 cases; Uremic cardiomyopathy: 92 cases; Hypertensive heart disease: 77 cases). We extracted the myocardial ultrasonic imaging features of these patients and screened the features, and four models of random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR) and gradient decision-making lifting tree (GBDT) were established to distinguish myocardial amyloidosis from other diseases. Finally, the diagnostic efficiency of the model was evaluated and compared with the traditional ultrasonic diagnostic methods. In the overall population, the four machine learning models we established could effectively distinguish CA from nonCA diseases, AUC (RF 0.77, SVM 0.81, LR 0.81, GBDT 0.71). The LR model had the best diagnostic efficiency with recall, F1-score, sensitivity and specificity of 0.21, 0.34, 0.21 and 1.0, respectively. Slightly better than the traditional ultrasonic diagnosis model. In further subgroup analysis, the myocardial amyloidosis group was compared one-by-one with the patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, uremic cardiomyopathy, and hypertensive heart disease groups, and the same method was used for feature extraction and data modeling. The diagnostic efficiency of the model was further improved. Notably, in identifying of the CA group and HHD group, AUC values reached more than 0.92, accuracy reached more than 0.87, sensitivity equal to or greater than 0.81, specificity 0.91, and F1 score higher than 0.84.

Methods: Thirty-two children with PCD diagnosed at the Children’s Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China, between January 2010 and January 2021 who had undergone cranial CT were retrospectively analyzed. Thirty-two children with OME and sinusitis diagnosed using cranial CT formed the control group. Multiple deep learning neural network training models based on PyTorch were built, and the optimal model was trained and selected to observe the differences between the cranial CT images of patients with PCD and those of general patients and to screen patients with PCD. Results: The Swin-Transformer, ConvNeXt, and GoogLeNet training models had optimal results, with an accuracy of approximately 0.94; VGG11, VGG16, VGG19, ResNet 34, and ResNet 50, which are neural network models with fewer layers, achieved relatively strong results; and Transformer and other neural networks with more layers or neural network models with larger receptive fields exhibited a relatively weak performance. A heat map revealed the differences in the sinus, middle ear mastoid, and fourth ventricle between the patients with PCD and the control group. Transfer learning can improve the modeling effect of neural networks.

This study retrospectively included patients with pre-treatment thoracic or abdominal contrast-enhanced CT from institution 1 (training set: 175 patients with 425 lesions) and institution 2 (external test set: 50 patients with 85 lesions). After segmenting osteolytic lesions on CT images, 1218 radiomics features were extracted. A random forest (RF) classifier was used to build the radiomics model with 10-fold cross-validation. Three radiologists distinguished MM from metastasis using a five-point scale, both with and without the assistance of RF model results. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC). The AUC of the RF model was 0.807 and 0.762 for the training and test set, respectively. The AUC of the RF model and the radiologists (0.653-0.778) was not significantly different for the test set (p ≥ 0.179). The AUC of all radiologists was significantly increased (0.833-0.900) when they were assisted by RF model results (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the CT-based radiomics model can differentiate MM from osteolytic bone metastasis and improve radiologists' diagnostic performance.","Seung‐Eun Lee,So Yeon Lee,Sanghee Kim,Yeon-Jung Huh,Joo-Yeon Lee,Ko Eun Lee,Joon-Yong Jung",,2023.0

The performance of all models was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curves with the area under curve (AUC).In the radiological model, only the enhancement degree (odds ratio, 8.299; 95% confidence interval, 2.070-32.703; P = 0.003) was an independent predictor for discriminating the LMs of digestive system NETs from those of NECs. The combined model constructed by the Rad score in combination with the enhancement degree showed good discrimination performance, with AUCs of 0.893, 0.841, and 0.740 in the training, testing, and external validation groups, respectively. In addition, it performed better than radiological model in the training and testing groups (AUC, 0.893 vs 0.726; AUC, 0.841 vs 0.621).The CT radiomics might be useful for discrimination LMs of digestive system NECs from NETs.","Xiaolei Gu,Yong Cui,Hai‐Tao Zhu,Xiaoting Li,Ping Xiang,Xiaoxiao He,Yang Li,Ming Lu,Zhongwu Li,Ying‐Shi Sun",,2023.0

One subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with cytokeratin 19 expression (CK19+), has shown to be more aggressive and has a poor prognosis. However, CK19+ is determined by immunohistochemical examination using a surgically resected specimen. This study is aimed at establishing a radiomics signature based on preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI for predicting CK19 status in HCC. Patients and Methods. Clinicopathological and imaging data were retrospectively collected from patients who underwent hepatectomy between February 2015 and December 2020. Patients who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and had CK19 results of histopathological examination were included. Radiomics features of the manually segmented lesion during the arterial, portal venous, and hepatobiliary phases were extracted. The 10 most reproducible and robust features at each phase were selected for construction of radiomics signatures, and their performance was evaluated by analyzing the area under the curve (AUC). The goodness of fit of the model was assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Results. A total of 110 patients were included. The incidence of CK19(+) HCC was 17% (19/110). Alpha fetoprotein was the only significant clinicopathological variable different between CK19(-) and CK19(+) groups. A majority of the selected radiomics features were wavelet filter-derived features. The AUCs of the three radiomics signatures based on arterial, portal venous, and hepatobiliary phases were 0.70 (95% CI: 0.56-0.83), 0.83 (95% CI: 0.73-0.92), and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.82-0.96), respectively. The three radiomics signatures were integrated, and the fusion signature yielded an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86-0.98) and was used as the final model for CK19(+) prediction. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the fusion signature was 0.84, 0.89, 0.88, 0.62, and 0.96, respectively. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed a good fit of the fusion signature ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1""> <mi>p</mi> <mo>&gt;</mo> <mn>0.05</mn> </math> ). Conclusion.

However, existing studies do not consider differential aging across cardiac regions.To estimate biological age of the left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV), myocardium, left atrium, and right atrium using magnetic resonance imaging radiomics phenotypes and to investigate determinants of aging by cardiac region.Cross-sectional.A total of 18,117 healthy UK Biobank participants including 8338 men (mean age = 64.2 ± 7.5) and 9779 women (mean age = 63.0 ± 7.4).A 1.5 T/balanced steady-state free precession.An automated algorithm was used to segment the five cardiac regions, from which radiomic features were extracted. Bayesian ridge regression was used to estimate biological age of each cardiac region with radiomics features as predictors and chronological age as the output. The ""age gap"" was the difference between biological and chronological age. Linear regression was used to calculate associations of age gap from each cardiac region with socioeconomic, lifestyle, body composition, blood pressure and arterial stiffness, blood biomarkers, mental well-being, multiorgan health, and sex hormone exposures (n = 49).Multiple testing correction with false discovery method (threshold = 5%).The largest model error was with RV and the smallest with LV age (mean absolute error in men: 5.26 vs. 4.96 years). There were 172 statistically significant age gap associations. Greater visceral adiposity was the strongest correlate of larger age gaps, for example, myocardial age gap in women (Beta = 0.85, P = 1.69 × 10-26 ). Poor mental health associated with large age gaps, for example, ""disinterested"" episodes and myocardial age gap in men (Beta = 0.25, P = 0.001), as did a history of dental problems (eg LV in men Beta = 0.19, P = 0.02). Higher bone mineral density was the strongest associate of smaller age gaps, for example, myocardial age gap in men (Beta = -1.52, P = 7.44 × 10-6 ).This work demonstrates image-based heart age estimation as a novel method for understanding cardiac aging.1.Stage 1.","Ahmed Salih,Esmeralda Ruiz Pujadas,Víctor M.

We aimed to propose a new prognostic system by integrating quantitative imaging features and clinical factors.This retrospective study included 1,319 patients with stage III-IVa NPC between April 1, 2010, and July 31, 2019, who underwent pretherapy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and received concurrent chemoradiotherapy with or without induction chemotherapy. The hand-crafted and deep-learned features were extracted from MRI for each patient. After feature selection, the clinical score, radiomic score, deep score, and integrative scores were constructed via Cox regression analysis. The scores were validated in two external cohorts. The predictive accuracy and discrimination were measured by the area under the curve (AUC) and risk group stratification. The end points were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS).Both radiomics and deep learning were complementary to clinical variables (age, T stage, and N stage; all P < .05). The clinical-deep score was superior or equivalent to clinical-radiomic score, whereas it was noninferior to clinical-radiomic-deep score (all P > .05). These findings were also verified in the evaluation of OS and DMFS. The clinical-deep score yielded an AUC of 0.713 (95% CI, 0.697 to 0.729) and 0.712 (95% CI, 0.693 to 0.731) in the two external validation cohorts for predicting PFS with good calibration. This scoring system could stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct survivals (all P < .05).We established and validated a prognostic system integrating clinical data and deep learning to provide an individual prediction of survival for patients with locally advanced NPC, which might inform clinicians in treatment decision making.","B.

With advances in artificial intelligence, visual image information can be processed into numerous quantitative features in an objective, repeatable and high-throughput fashion, in a process known as radiomics analysis (RA). Recently, investigators have attempted to apply RA to stroke neuroimaging in the hope of promoting personalized precision medicine. This review aimed to evaluate the role of RA as an adjuvant tool in the prognosis of disability after stroke. We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines, searching PubMed and Embase using the keywords: 'magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'radiomics', and 'stroke'. The PROBAST tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Radiomics quality score (RQS) was also applied to evaluate the methodological quality of radiomics studies. Of the 150 abstracts returned by electronic literature research, 6 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Five studies evaluated predictive value for different predictive models (PMs). In all studies, the combined PMs consisting of clinical and radiomics features have achieved the best predictive performance compared to PMs based only on clinical or radiomics features, the results varying from an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75-0.86) to an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.87-0.97). The median RQS of the included studies was 15, reflecting a moderate methodological quality. Assessing the risk of bias using PROBAST, potential high risk of bias in participants selection was identified. Our findings suggest that combined models integrating both clinical and advanced imaging variables seem to better predict the patients' disability outcome group (favorable outcome: modified Rankin scale (mRS) ≤ 2 and unfavorable outcome: mRS > 2) at three and six months after stroke. Although radiomics studies' findings are significant in research field, these results should be validated in multiple clinical settings in order to help clinicians to provide individual patients with optimal tailor-made treatment.","Hanna Dragos,Adina Stan,Roxana Pintican,Diana Feier,Andrei Lebovici,Paul-Ștefan Panaitescu,Constantin Dina,Ștefan Strilciuc,Dafin F.

Methods Between October 2017 and August 2022, 105 LARC NCRT-naïve patients were enrolled in this study. After careful evaluation, data for 84 patients that met the inclusion criteria were used to develop and validate the NCRT response models. All patients received NCRT, and the post-treatment response was evaluated by pathological assessment. We manual segmented the volume of tumors and 105 radiomics features were extracted from three-dimensional MRIs. Then, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm was implemented for evaluating and incorporating important tumor features. The predictive performance of MRI sequences and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for NCRT response were compared. Finally, the optimal pre-Radiomics and delta-Radiomics models were established respectively. The predictive performance of the radionics model was confirmed using 5-fold cross-validation, 10-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out validation, and independent validation. The predictive accuracy of the model was based on the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Results There was no significant difference in clinical factors between patients with good and poor reactions. Integrating different MRI modes and the SMOTE method improved the performance of the radiomics model. The pre-Radiomics model (train AUC: 0.93 ± 0.06; test AUC: 0.79) and delta-Radiomcis model (train AUC: 0.96 ± 0.03; test AUC: 0.83) all have high NCRT response prediction performance by LARC. Overall, the delta-Radiomics model was superior to the pre-Radiomics model. Conclusion MRI-based pre-Radiomics model and delta-Radiomics model all have good potential to predict the post-treatment response of LARC to NCRT. Delta-Radiomics analysis has a huge potential for clinical application in facilitating the provision of personalized therapy.","Likun Wang,Xueliang Wu,Ruoxi Tian,Hongfang Ma,Zekun Jiang,Wei Zhao,Guoqing Cui,Meng Li,Quanjun Hu,Xiangyang Yu,Wengui Xu",,2023.0
10.1007/s11633-022-1364-x,,,Machine Learning in Lung Cancer Radiomics,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Medical imaging technologies such as computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are routinely used for non-invasive lung cancer diagnosis. In clinical practice, physicians investigate the characteristics of tumors such as the size, shape and location from CT and PET images to make decisions. Recently, scientists have proposed various computational image features that can capture more information than that directly perceivable by human eyes, which promotes the rise of radiomics. Radiomics is a research field on the conversion of medical images into high-dimensional features with data-driven methods to help subsequent data mining for better clinical decision support. Radiomic analysis has four major steps: image preprocessing, tumor segmentation, feature extraction and clinical prediction. Machine learning, including the high-profile deep learning, facilitates the development and application of radiomic methods. Various radiomic methods have been proposed recently, such as the construction of radiomic signatures, tumor habitat analysis, cluster pattern characterization and end-to-end prediction of tumor properties. These methods have been applied in many studies aiming at lung cancer diagnosis, treatment and monitoring, shedding light on future non-invasive evaluations of the nodule malignancy, histological subtypes, genomic properties and treatment responses. In this review, we summarized and categorized the studies on the general workflow, methods for clinical prediction and clinical applications of machine learning in lung cancer radiomic studies, introduced some commonly-used software tools, and discussed the limitations of current methods and possible future directions.","Jiaqi Li,Zhuofeng Li,Lei Wei,Xuegong Zhang",,2023.0

Radiomics variables were extracted from pretreatment CT and selected by Spearman correlation coefficients and clinical features by Logistics regression analysis. We performed effective diagnostic algorithms principal components analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) to develop an early classification model among DCB and non-durable benefit (NDB) groups. A total of 26 radiomics features and 6 clinical features were selected, and then principal component analysis was used to obtain 6 principal components for SVM building.

Some acquisition models simultaneously obtain multiparametric images and quantitative maps to reduce scan times and avoid potential issues associated with the registration of different images. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to provide complementary information on a target lesion and thus overcome the limitations of individual techniques. In this review, we introduce methods to acquire multiparametric MRI data in a clinically feasible scan time with a particular focus on simultaneous acquisition techniques, and we discuss how multiparametric MRI data can be analyzed as a whole rather than each parameter separately. Such data analysis approaches include clinical scoring systems, machine learning, radiomics, and deep learning. Other techniques combine multiple images to create new quantitative maps associated with meaningful aspects of human biology. They include the magnetic resonance g-ratio, the inner to the outer diameter of a nerve fiber, and the aerobic glycolytic index, which captures the metabolic status of tumor tissues.","Akifumi Hagiwara,Shohei Fujita,Ryo Kurokawa,Christina Andica,Koji Kamagata,Shigeki Aoki",,2023.0

Methods A total of 113 patients with histologically confirmed ccRCC were randomly assigned to the training set (n=67) and the testing set (n=46). The baseline and CT imaging data of the patients were evaluated statistically to develop a clinical model. A radiomics model was created, and the radiomics score (Rad-score) was calculated by extracting radiomics features from the CT images. Then, a clinical radiomics nomogram was developed using multivariate logistic regression analysis by combining the Rad-score and critical clinical characteristics. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the discrimination of small ccRCC in both the training and testing sets. Results The radiomics model was constructed using six features obtained from the CT images. The shape and relative enhancement value of the nephrographic phase (REV of the NP) were found to be independent risk factors in the clinical model. The area under the curve (AUC) values for the training and testing sets for the clinical radiomics nomogram were 0.940 and 0.902, respectively. Decision curve analysis (DCA) revealed that the radiomics nomogram model was a better predictor, with the highest degree of coincidence. Conclusion The CT-based radiomics nomogram has the potential to be a noninvasive and preoperative method for predicting the WHO/ISUP grade of small ccRCC.","Yankun Gao,Xia Wang,Xiaoying Zhao,Chao Zhu,Cuiping Li,Jianying Li,Xingwang Wu",,2023.0

The aim of this study is to evaluate the stability of radiomics analysis on phantom scans with photon-counting detector CT (PCCT).Photon-counting CT scans of organic phantoms consisting of 4 apples, kiwis, limes, and onions each were performed at 10 mAs, 50 mAs, and 100 mAs with 120-kV tube current. The phantoms were segmented semi-automatically and original radiomics parameters were extracted. This was followed by statistical analysis including concordance correlation coefficients (CCC), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), as well as random forest (RF) analysis, and cluster analysis to determine the stable and important parameters.Seventy-three of the 104 (70%) extracted features showed excellent stability with a CCC value > 0.9 when compared in a test and retest analysis, and 68 features (65.4%) were stable compared to the original in a rescan after repositioning. Between the test scans with different mAs values, 78 (75%) features were rated with excellent stability. Eight radiomics features were identified that had an ICC value greater than 0.75 in at least 3 of 4 groups when comparing the different phantoms in a phantom group. In addition, the RF analysis identified many features that are important for distinguishing the phantom groups.Radiomics analysis using PCCT data provides high feature stability on organic phantoms, which may facilitate the implementation of radiomics analysis likewise in clinical routine.• Radiomics analysis using photon-counting computed tomography provides high feature stability. • Photon-counting computed tomography may pave the way for implementation of radiomics analysis in clinical routine.","Alexander Hertel,Hishan Tharmaseelan,Lukas T.

The patients were divided into two groups; patients with symptoms of transient ischemic attack after CTA and patients without symptoms of transient ischemic attack after CTA. Then we performed random sampling methods stratified by the predictive outcome to obtain the training set (N = 165) and testing set (N = 66). 3D Slicer was employed to select the site of plaque on the computed tomography image as the volume of interest. An open-source package PyRadiomics in Python was used to extract radiomics features from the volume of interests. The random forest and logistic regression models were used to screen feature variables, and five classification algorithms were used, including random forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors. Data on radiomic feature information, clinical information, and the combination of these pieces of information were used to generate the model that predicts the risk of transient ischemic attack in patients with mild carotid artery stenosis (30-50% North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial).The random forest model that was built based on the radiomics and clinical feature information had the highest accuracy (area under curve = 0.879; 95% confidence interval, 0.787-0.979). The combined model outperformed the clinical model, whereas the combined model showed no significant difference from the radiomics model.The random forest model constructed with both radiomics and clinical information can accurately predict and improve discriminative power of computed tomography angiography in identifying ischemic symptoms in patients with carotid atherosclerosis.

However, a proportion of patients have been found to be at risk of local failure (LF) after treatment. Hence, accurately identifying patients with LF risk after SRS treatment is critical to the development of successful treatment plans and the prognoses of patients. To accurately predict BM patients with the occurrence of LF after SRS therapy, we develop and validate a machine learning (ML) model based on pre-treatment multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics and clinical risk factors.In this study, 337 BM patients were included (247, 60, and 30 in the training set, internal validation set, and external validation set, respectively). Four clinical features and 223 radiomics features were selected using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy (mRMR) filters.

All subjects underwent MR scanning between January 2018 and October 2022. The coronal STIR PROPELLER sequence was employed to segment PG and perform TA using the MaZda5 software. A total of 65 PGs underwent segmentation and texture feature extraction (48 PGs were included in the pSS control group, and 17 PGs were included in the pSS NHL group). Following parameter reduction techniques, univariate analysis, multivariate regression, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, the following TA parameters proved to be independently associated with NHL development in pSS: CH4S6_Sum_Variance and CV4S6_Inverse_Difference_Moment, with an area under ROC of 0.800 and 0.875, respectively. The radiomic model (resulting by combining the two previously independent TA features), presented 94.12% sensitivity and 85.42% specificity in differentiating between the two studied groups, reaching the highest area under ROC of 0.931 for the chosen cutoff value of 1.556. This study suggests the potential role of radiomics in revealing new imaging biomarkers that might serve as useful predictors for lymphoma development in patients with pSS. Further research on multicentric cohorts is warranted to confirm the obtained results and the added benefit of TA in risk stratification for patients with pSS.","Delia Muntean,Lavinia Manuela Lenghel,Paul-Andrei Ștefan,Daniela Fodor,Maria Bădărînză,Csaba Csutak,Sorin M Dudea,Georgeta Mihaela Rusu",,2023.0

Currently, efforts are being made to improve tumor characterization and provide insightful information for outcome prediction. Radiomics is an emerging area of study that involves the conversion of medical images into mineable data; these data are then used to extract quantitative features based on shape, intensity, texture, and other parameters; (2) Methods: A systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature was conducted; (3) Results: A total of 437 manuscripts were identified. Fifteen manuscripts met the inclusion criteria. The main targets described were the evaluation of textural features to determine tumor-programmed death-ligand 1 expression; a surrogate for microvessel density and heterogeneity of perfusion; patient stratification into groups at high and low risk of progression; prediction of early recurrence, 1-year locoregional failure and survival outcome, including progression-free survival and overall survival, in patients with locally advanced HPSCC; thyroid cartilage invasion, early disease progression, recurrence, induction chemotherapy response, treatment response, and prognosis; and (4) Conclusions: our findings suggest that radiomics represents a potentially useful tool in the diagnostic workup as well as during the treatment and follow-up of patients with HPSCC.

We selected the best prediction model according to the model performance tested by area under the curve (AUC) analysis across 1,000 iterations of prediction from three most common machine learning methods: support vector machine, feed-forward neural network (FNN), and random forest, through several steps of feature selection. Then, the selected best model was also validated in an external validation dataset (n = 24). The established radiomics signature had good predictive efficacy. FNN exhibited the best model performance on the training and validation groups: its AUC value was 0.960 (95% CI, 0.899-1). The accuracy of this model was 89.5%, and its sensitivity and specificity were 0.938 and 0.864, respectively. The AUC of external validation dataset was 0.793. Our radiomics model based on preoperative CTA images is valuable. The radiomics approach of preoperative CTA to differentiate new emboli from old is feasible.","Rong Liu,Junlin Yang,Wei Zhang,Xiaobo Li,Dai Shi,Wenli Cai,Yue Zhang,Guohua Fan,Chenglong Li,Zhen Jiang",,2023.0

Although therapeutic progresses have significantly improved Overall Survival (OS), a number of patients do not respond to HD-MTX-based chemotherapy (15-25%) or experience relapse (25-50%) after an initial response. The reasons underlying this poor response to therapy are unknown. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop improved predictive models for PCNSL. In this study, we investigated whether radiomics features can improve outcome prediction in patients with PCNSL. A total of 80 patients diagnosed with PCNSL were enrolled. A patient sub-group, with complete Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) series, were selected for the stratification analysis. Following radiomics feature extraction and selection, different Machine Learning (ML) models were tested for OS and Progression-free Survival (PFS) prediction. To assess the stability of the selected features, images from 23 patients scanned at three different time points were used to compute the Interclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and to evaluate the reproducibility of each feature for both original and normalized images. Features extracted from Z-score normalized images were significantly more stable than those extracted from non-normalized images with an improvement of about 38% on average (p-value < 10-12). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) showed that radiomics-based prediction overcame prediction based on current clinical prognostic factors with an improvement of 23% for OS and 50% for PFS, respectively. These results indicate that radiomics features extracted from normalized MR images can improve prognosis stratification of PCNSL patients and pave the way for further study on its potential role to drive treatment choice.","Michela Destito,Aldo Marzullo,Riccardo Leone,Paolo Zaffino,Sara Steffanoni,Federico Erbella,Francesco Calimeri,Nicoletta Anzalone,Elena De Momi,Andrés J.M.

In this study, we compared the xerostomia classification performance of radiomics features calculated on clinically relevant and de novo sub-regions of the parotid glands of HNC patients.Material and Methods: All patients (N = 117) were treated with TomoTherapy in 30–35 fractions of 2–2.167 Gy per fraction with daily mega-voltage-CT (MVCT) acquisition for image-guidance purposes. Radiomics features (N = 123) were extracted from daily MVCTs for the whole parotid gland and nine sub-regions. The changes in feature values after each complete week of treatment were considered as predictors of xerostomia (CTCAEv4.03, grade ≥ 2) at 6 and 12 months. Combinations of predictors were generated following the removal of statistically redundant information and stepwise selection. The classification performance of the logistic regression models was evaluated on train and test sets of patients using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) associated with the different sub-regions at each week of treatment and benchmarked with the performance of models solely using dose and toxicity at baseline.Results: In this study, radiomics-based models predicted xerostomia better than standard clinical predictors. Models combining dose to the parotid and xerostomia scores at baseline yielded an AUCtest of 0.63 and 0.61 for xerostomia prediction at 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy while models based on radiomics features extracted from the whole parotid yielded a maximum AUCtest of 0.67 and 0.75, respectively. Overall, across sub-regions, maximum AUCtest was 0.76 and 0.80 for xerostomia prediction at 6 and 12 months. Within the first two weeks of treatment, the cranial part of the parotid systematically yielded the highest AUCtest.Conclusion: Our results indicate that variations of radiomics features calculated on sub-regions of the parotid glands can lead to earlier and improved prediction of xerostomia in HNC patients.","Thomas Berger,D.

Methods We performed a systematic analysis of inflammation‐related genes (IRGs) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus and mapped their interaction network to assess the specific relationship between these differentially expressed inflammation‐related genes (DEIRGs) and inflammation. The association between DEIRGs and prognosis was discussed and further validated using consensus cluster analysis. Next, we constructed IRGs‐related risk score from the collected information and validated the prognostic value of the model using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Computed tomographic images corresponding to the TCGA‐ccRCC cohort were obtained from the Cancer Imaging Archive database for radiomics signature extraction. Results We screened for prognostic IRGs and found that they were positively correlated with inflammatory cells in the tumor microenvironment associated with tumor progression and metastasis, such as activated CD8+ cells, myeloid‐derived suppressor cells and neutrophils. The impact of IRGs on the prognosis of ccRCC patients was also verified. Using these differentially expressed genes, we successfully constructed a risk signature and validated its good prognosis assessment for patients. Furthermore, radiomics‐based prognostic models performed better than those using risk signatures or clinical characteristics. Conclusions IRG‐related risk scores play an important role in assessing the prognosis and improving the management of patients with ccRCC. Through this feature, the infiltration of immune cells in the TME can be predicted. Furthermore, non‐invasive radiomics signatures showed satisfactory performance in predicting ccRCC prognosis.","Yang Yu,Hang Huang,Haote Liang",,2023.0

However, the introduction of the omics sciences such as metabolomics, proteomics, and molecular genomics, have optimized the therapeutic path for patients and implementing novel information parallel to the mutational asset targetable by specific clinical treatments. Parallel to the ""omics"" clusters, radiological imaging has been gradually employed to generate a specific omics cluster termed ""radiomics"". Radiomics is a novel advanced approach to imaging, extracting quantitative, and ideally, reproducible data from radiological images using sophisticated mathematical analysis, including disease-specific patterns, that could not be detected by the human eye. Along with radiomics, radiogenomics, defined as the integration of ""radiology"" and ""genomics"", is an emerging field exploring the relationship between specific features extracted from radiological images and genetic or molecular traits of a particular disease to construct adequate predictive models. Accordingly, radiological characteristics of the tissue are supposed to mimic a defined genotype and phenotype and to better explore the heterogeneity and the dynamic evolution of the tumor over the time. Despite such improvements, we are still far from achieving approved and standardized protocols in clinical practice. Nevertheless, what can we learn by this emerging multidisciplinary clinical approach? This minireview provides a focused overview on the significance of radiomics integrated by RNA sequencing in BC. We will also discuss advances and future challenges of such radiomics-based approach.","Davide Bellini,Marika Milan,Antonella Bordin,Roberto Rizzi,Marco Rengo,Simone Vicini,Alessandro Onori,Iacopo Carbone,Elena De Falco",,2023.0

GISTs have malignant potential, whereas leiomyomas and schwannomas are considered benign. Purpose This study aimed to establish a combined radiomic model based on EUS images for distinguishing GISTs from leiomyomas and schwannomas in the stomach. Methods EUS images of pathologically confirmed GISTs, leiomyomas, and schwannomas were collected from five centers. Gastric SELs were divided into training and testing datasets based on random split‐sample method (7:3). Radiomic features were extracted from the tumor and muscularis propria regions. Principal component analysis, least absolute shrinkage, and selection operator were used for feature selection. Support vector machine was used to construct radiomic models. Two radiomic models were built: the conventional radiomic model included tumor features alone, whereas the combined radiomic model incorporated features from the tumor and muscularis propria regions. Results A total of 3933 EUS images from 485 cases were included. For the differential diagnosis of GISTs from leiomyomas and schwannomas, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 74.5%, 72.2%, 78.7%, and 0.754, respectively, for the EUS experts; 76.8%, 74.4%, 81.0%, and 0.830, respectively, for the conventional radiomic model; and 90.9%, 91.0%, 90.6%, and 0.953, respectively, for the combined radiomic model. For gastric SELs &lt;20 mm, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the combined radiomic model were 91.4%, 91.6%, 91.1%, and 0.960, respectively. Conclusions We developed and validated a combined radiomic model to distinguish gastric GISTs from leiomyomas and schwannomas.

Methods One hundred and twenty NPC patients who underwent chemoradiotherapy were enrolled (80 in the training cohort and 40 in the validation cohort). Acquiring data and screening features were performed successively. Totally 1133 radiomics features were extracted from the T2-weight images before and after treatment. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, recursive feature elimination algorithm, random forest, and minimum-redundancy maximum-relevancy (mRMR) method were used for feature selection. Nomogram discrimination and calibration were evaluated. Harrell’s concordance index (C-index) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were applied to appraise the prognostic performance of nomograms. Survival curves were plotted using Kaplan–Meier method. Results Integrating independent clinical predictors with pre-treatment and post-treatment radiomics signatures which were calculated in conformity with radiomics features, we established a clinical-and-radiomics nomogram by multivariable Cox regression. Nomogram consisting of 14 pre-treatment and 7 post-treatment selected features has been proved to yield a reliable predictive performance in both training and validation groups. The C-index of clinical-and-radiomics nomogram was 0.953 (all P &lt; 0.05), which was higher than that of clinical (0.861) or radiomics nomograms alone (based on pre-treatment statistics: 0.942; based on post-treatment statistics: 0.944). Moreover, we received Rad-score of pre-treatment named RS1 and post-treatment named RS2 and all were used as independent predictors to divide patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that lower RS1 (less than cutoff value, − 1.488) and RS2 (less than cutoff value, − 0.180) were easier to avoid disease progression (all P &lt; 0.01). It showed clinical benefit with decision curve analysis. Conclusions MR-based radiomics measured the burden on primary tumor before treatment and the tumor regression after chemoradiotherapy, and was used to build a model to predict progression-free survival (PFS) in the stage II–IVA NPC patients. It can also help to distinguish high-risk patients from low-risk patients, thus guiding personalized treatment decisions effectively.","Mi-Xue Sun,Min Zhao,Zhao Li,Haoran Jiang,Yuxia Duan,Gang Li",,2023.0

Method: The preoperative liver MRI data and clinical information of 130 HCC patients with pathologically confirmed were retrospectively studied. These patients were divided into MVI-positive group (MVI+) and MVI-negative group (MVI-) based on postoperative pathology. After a series of dimensionality reduction analysis, six features were finally selected. Then, linear support vector machine (linear SVM), support vector machine with rbf kernel function (rbf-SVM), logistic regression (LR), Random forest (RF) and XGBoost (XGB) algorithms were used to establish the MVI prediction model for preoperative HCC patients. Then, rbf-SVM with the best predictive performance was selected to construct the radiomics score (R-score). Finally, we combined R-score and clinical-pathology-image independent predictors to establish a combined nomogram model and corresponding individual models. The predictive performance of individual models and combined nomogram was evaluated and compared by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Result: Alpha-fetoprotein concentration, peritumor enhancement, maximum tumor diameter, smooth tumor margins, tumor growth pattern, presence of intratumor hemorrhage, and RVI were independent predictors of MVI.

We characterized the prognostic value of CSF3. Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis, univariate and multivariate Cox regression, subgroup analysis, Spearman analysis, and gene set variation analysis enrichment were used to elucidate the prognostic value of the CSF3 gene and the correlation between CSF3 and tumor features. We used CIBERSORT to analyze the correlation between CSF3 and cancer immune infiltrates.

CSF3 expression varied between tumor and normal group tissues. CSF3 expression was found to be a significant risk factor for survival outcomes. A positive association was found between CSF3 expression and immune infiltration. The radiomics model based on both LR and SVM methods showed high clinical practicability.The results showed that CSF3 has a prognostic value in HGG.

According to ACOSOG Z0011 trials, the new goal of the ALN status evaluation is tumor burden (low burden, &lt; 3 positive ALNs; high burden, ≥ 3 positive ALNs), instead of metastasis or non-metastasis. We aimed to develop a radiomics nomogram integrating clinicopathologic features, ABUS imaging features and radiomics features from ABUS for predicting ALN tumor burden in early breast cancer. Methods A total of 310 patients with breast cancer were enrolled. Radiomics score was generated from the ABUS images. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to develop the predicting model, we incorporated the radiomics score, ABUS imaging features and clinicopathologic features, and this was presented with a radiomics nomogram. Besides, we separately constructed an ABUS model to analyze the performance of ABUS imaging features in predicting ALN tumor burden. The performance of the models was assessed through discrimination, calibration curve, and decision curve. Results The radiomics score, which consisted of 13 selected features, showed moderate discriminative ability (AUC 0.794 and 0.789 in the training and test sets). The ABUS model, comprising diameter, hyperechoic halo, and retraction phenomenon, showed moderate predictive ability (AUC 0.772 and 0.736 in the training and test sets). The ABUS radiomics nomogram, integrating radiomics score with retraction phenomenon and US-reported ALN status, showed an accurate agreement between ALN tumor burden and pathological verification (AUC 0.876 and 0.851 in the training and test sets).

A brain tumor that is malignant is a life-threatening disorder. Glioblastoma is the most prevalent kind of adult brain cancer and the 1 with the poorest prognosis, with a median survival time of less than a year. The presence of O6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, a particular genetic sequence seen in tumors, has been proven to be a positive prognostic indicator and a significant predictor of recurrence.This strong revival of interest in AI is modeled in particular to major technological advances which have significantly increased the performance of the predicted model for medical decision support. Establishing reliable forecasts remains a significant challenge for electronic health records (EHRs). By enhancing clinical practice, precision medicine promises to improve healthcare delivery. The goal is to produce improved prognosis, diagnosis, and therapy through evidence-based sub stratification of patients, transforming established clinical pathways to optimize care for each patient's individual requirements. The abundance of today's healthcare data, dubbed ""big data,"" provides great resources for new knowledge discovery, potentially advancing precision treatment. The latter necessitates multidisciplinary initiatives that will use the knowledge, skills, and medical data of newly established organizations with diverse backgrounds and expertise.The aim of this paper is to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images to train and evaluate your model to detect the presence of MGMT promoter methylation in this competition to predict the genetic subtype of glioblastoma based transfer learning. Our objective is to emphasize the basic problems in the developing disciplines of radiomics and radiogenomics, as well as to illustrate the computational challenges from the perspective of big data analytics.","Houneida Sakly,Mourad Ben Saïd,Jayne Seekins,Ramzi Guetari,Naoufel Kraïem,Mehrez Marzougui",,2023.0

We investigated the role of computed tomography (CT) radiomics models integrating clinical predictors for the individualised prediction of LNM in early-stage TGCT. Ninety-one patients with surgically proven testicular germ cell tumours and contrast-enhanced CT were included in this retrospective study. Dedicated radiomics software was used to segment 273 retroperitoneal lymph nodes and extract features. After feature selection, radiomics-based machine learning models were developed to predict LN metastasis. The robustness of the procedure was controlled by 10-fold cross-validation. Using multivariable logistic regression modelling, we developed three prediction models: a radiomics-only model, a clinical-only model, and a combined radiomics–clinical model. The models’ performances were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Finally, decision curve analysis was performed to estimate the clinical usefulness of the predictive model. The radiomics-only model for predicting lymph node metastasis reached a greater discrimination power than the clinical-only model, with an AUC of 0.87 (±0.04; 95% CI) vs. 0.75 (±0.08; 95% CI) in our study cohort. The combined model integrating clinical risk factors and selected radiomics features outperformed the clinical-only and the radiomics-only prediction models, and showed good discrimination with an area under the curve of 0.89 (±0.03; 95% CI). The decision curve analysis demonstrated the clinical usefulness of our proposed combined model. The presented combined CT-based radiomics–clinical model represents an exciting non-invasive tool for individualised LN metastasis prediction in testicular germ cell tumours. Multi-centre validation is required to generate high-quality evidence for its clinical application.","Catharina Silvia Lisson,Sabitha Manoj,Daniel Wolf,Jasper Schrader,Stefan A.

The workflow of radiomics is complex due to several methodological steps and nuances, which often leads to inadequate reporting and evaluation, and poor reproducibility. Available reporting guidelines and checklists for artificial intelligence and predictive modeling include relevant good practices, but they are not tailored to radiomic research. There is a clear need for a complete radiomics checklist for study planning, manuscript writing, and evaluation during the review process to facilitate the repeatability and reproducibility of studies. We here present a documentation standard for radiomic research that can guide authors and reviewers. Our motivation is to improve the quality and reliability and, in turn, the reproducibility of radiomic research. We name the checklist CLEAR (CheckList for EvaluAtion of Radiomics research), to convey the idea of being more transparent. With its 58 items, the CLEAR checklist should be considered a standardization tool providing the minimum requirements for presenting clinical radiomics research. In addition to a dynamic online version of the checklist, a public repository has also been set up to allow the radiomics community to comment on the checklist items and adapt the checklist for future versions. Prepared and revised by an international group of experts using a modified Delphi method, we hope the CLEAR checklist will serve well as a single and complete scientific documentation tool for authors and reviewers to improve the radiomics literature.","Burak Koçak,Bettina Baeßler,Spyridon Bakas,Renato Cuocolo,Andriy Fedorov,Lena Maier-Hein,Nathaniel D.

The purpose of this study was to establish a computed tomography (CT)-based radiomics model to differentiate pneumonia-like PPL from infectious pneumonia. Methods: In this retrospective study, 79 patients with pneumonia-like PPL and 176 patients with infectious pneumonia from 12 medical centers were enrolled. Patients from center 1 to center 7 were assigned to the training or validation cohort, and the remaining patients from other centers were used as the external test cohort. Radiomics features were extracted from CT images. A three-step procedure was applied for radiomics feature selection and radiomics signature building, including the inter- and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs), a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the significant clinicoradiological variables and construct a clinical factor model. Two radiologists reviewed the CT images for the external test set. Performance of the radiomics model, clinical factor model, and each radiologist were assessed by receiver operating characteristic, and area under the curve (AUC) was compared. Results: A total of 144 patients (44 with pneumonia-like PPL and 100 infectious pneumonia) were in the training cohort, 38 patients (12 with pneumonia-like PPL and 26 infectious pneumonia) were in the validation cohort, and 73 patients (23 with pneumonia-like PPL and 50 infectious pneumonia) were in the external test cohort. Twenty-three radiomics features were selected to build the radiomics model, which yielded AUCs of 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94–0.99), 0.93 (95% CI: 0.85–0.98), and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.87–0.99) in the training, validation, and external test cohort, respectively.

Modern medical care and imaging technology are becoming increasingly inseparable. However, the current diagnosis pattern of signal to image to knowledge inevitably leads to information distortion and noise introduction in the procedure of image reconstruction (from signal to image). Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that can mine knowledge from vast amounts of data offer opportunities to disrupt established workflows. In this prospective study, for the first time, we develop an AI-based signal-to-knowledge diagnostic scheme for lung nodule classification directly from the computed tomography (CT) raw data (the signal). We find that the raw data achieves almost comparable performance with CT, indicating that it is possible to diagnose diseases without reconstructing images. Moreover, the incorporation of raw data through three common convolutional network structures greatly improves the performance of the CT models in all cohorts (with a gain ranging from 0.01 to 0.12), demonstrating that raw data contains diagnostic information that CT does not possess.

Radiomics is an emerging image analysis technique that extracts texture information to provide a more objective basis for medical imaging diagnostics, overcoming the subjective nature of traditional methods. By utilizing the difficulty of reproducing radiomics features under different imaging protocols, we can more accurately evaluate the performance of CT denoising algorithms.We introduced radiomic feature reproducibility analysis as an evaluation metric for a denoising algorithm. Also, we proposed a low-dose CT denoising method based on a generative adversarial network (GAN), which outperformed well-known CT denoising methods.Although the proposed model produced excellent results visually, the traditional image assessment metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity failed to show distinctive performance differences between the proposed method and the conventional ones. However, radiomic feature reproducibility analysis provided a distinctive assessment of the CT denoising performance. Furthermore, radiomic feature reproducibility analysis allowed fine-tuning of the hyper-parameters of the GAN.We demonstrated that the well-tuned GAN architecture outperforms the well-known CT denoising methods. Our study is the first to introduce radiomics reproducibility analysis as an evaluation metric for CT denoising. We look forward that the study may bridge the gap between traditional objective and subjective evaluations in the clinical medical imaging field.","Jina Lee,Jiyeon Jeon,Yong Woo Hong,Dawun Jeong,Yeonggul Jang,Bo-Young Jeon,Hye Jin Baek,Eun Cho,Hackjoon Shim,Hyuk Jae Chang",,2023.0

Despite the wide use of data transformation methods to reduce data discrepancies between different data domains, detailed analysis for explaining the performance of data transformation methods is lacking.ApproachThis study compares several data transformation methods in the tuberculosis detection task with multi-institutional chest x-ray (CXR) data. Five different data transformations, including normalization, standardization with and without lung masking, and multi-frequency-based (MFB) standardization with and without lung masking were implemented. A tuberculosis detection network was trained using a reference dataset, and the data from six other sites were used for the network performance comparison. To analyze data harmonization performance, we extracted radiomic features and calculated the Mahalanobis distance. We visualized the features with a dimensionality reduction technique. Through similar methods, deep features of the trained networks were also analyzed to examine the models’ responses to the data from various sites.ResultsFrom various numerical assessments, the MFB standardization with lung masking provided the highest network performance for the non-reference datasets. From the radiomic and deep feature analyses, the features of the multi-site CXRs after MFB with lung masking were found to be well homogenized to the reference data, whereas the others showed limited performance.ConclusionsConventional normalization and standardization showed suboptimal performance in minimizing feature differences among various sites. Our study emphasizes the strengths of MFB standardization with lung masking in terms of network performance and feature homogenization.","Hyeongseok Kim,Seo-Young Lee,Woo Jung Shim,Minseong Choi,Seungryong Cho",,2023.0

Apart from behavioral symptoms investigated by psychiatric methods, there is no standard biological test to diagnose ADHD. This study aimed to explore whether the radiomics features based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance (rs-fMRI) have more discriminative power for the diagnosis of ADHD. The rs-fMRI of 187 subjects with ADHD and 187 healthy controls were collected from 5 sites of ADHD-200 Consortium. A total of four preprocessed rs-fMRI images including regional homogeneity (ReHo), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) and network degree centrality (DC) were used in this study. From each of the four images, we extracted 93 radiomics features within each of 116 automated anatomical labeling brain areas, resulting in a total of 43,152 features for each subject. After dimension reduction and feature selection, 19 radiomics features were retained (5 from ALFF, 9 from ReHo, 3 from VMHC and 2 from DC). By training and optimizing a support vector machine model using the retained features of training dataset, we achieved the accuracy of 76.3% and 77.0% (areas under curve = 0.811 and 0.797) in the training and testing datasets, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that radiomics can be a novel strategy for fully utilizing rs-fMRI information to distinguish ADHD from healthy controls.

One of the critical challenges for integrating diagnostic DNNs into radiological and oncological applications is their lack of interpretability, preventing clinicians from understanding the model predictions. Therefore, we study and propose the integration of expert-derived radiomics and DNN-predicted biomarkers in interpretable classifiers which we call ConRad, for computerized tomography (CT) scans of lung cancer. Importantly, the tumor biomarkers are predicted from a concept bottleneck model (CBM) such that once trained, our ConRad models do not require labor-intensive and time-consuming biomarkers. In our evaluation and practical application, the only input to ConRad is a segmented CT scan. The proposed model is compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which act as a black box classifier. We further investigated and evaluated all combinations of radiomics, predicted biomarkers and CNN features in five different classifiers. We found the ConRad models using non-linear SVM and the logistic regression with the Lasso outperform others in five-fold cross-validation, although we highlight that interpretability of ConRad is its primary advantage. The Lasso is used for feature selection, which substantially reduces the number of non-zero weights while increasing the accuracy.

However, the inherent non-biological-interpretability of the radiomic features strongly hinders their clinical application. Therefore, it is of pivotal importance to elucidate the biological meaning behind the given radiomic features. In this paper, an innovative approach is proposed where dedicated <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">in vivo</i> experiments are used to correlate biological meaning to specific radiomic features. As a proof of concept, the radiomic features extracted from the computed tomography (CT) scans of three widely used and well-characterized murine tumor models (CT26, 4T1 and EMT6) were analyzed and compared using an exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The results revealed that on the basis of the features, a distinction could be made between the different tumor models. Furthermore, the effect of an inflammatory response on the radiomic features was investigated. Lastly, the repeatability of radiomic features upon modulation of the tumor microenvironment was analyzed. The features exhibited a high repeatability level over the course of time, displaying consistency between the different experiments. Altogether, these encouraging results support the feasibility of the proposed approach to pave the way for the use of radiomics in routine clinical practice.","Amir L.

The purpose of this paper was to use MR imaging radiomics based on lumbar soft tissue to analyze changes in the lumbar fascia of patients with low back pain.We retrospectively analyzed the lumbar MRI of 197 patients with low back pain. Patients were randomly assigned to either the training (n = 138) or validation (n = 59) cohorts. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to create radiomics model and combined nomogram model and their predictive performance were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves.Seven radiomics features based on lumbar soft tissue MRI images were established, which performed well in distinguishing between low back pain patients with fascial changes and normal individuals demonstrated an excellent ability to identify differences, with an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88-0.96) in the training cohort and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.73-0.96) in the validation cohort, which performed better than the clinical model significantly only.The nomogram based on clinical features and radiomics features of MR images had a good predictive ability to differentiate fascial alterations in patients with low back pain from normal subjects. It had the potential to be used as a decision support tool to assist clinicians in determining the etiology of patients with lower back pain and managing patients promptly, particularly in the early stage of the fasciitis when significant abnormalities on imaging were difficult to detect.","Mingxin Song,Hui Yang,He-qi Yang,Shanshan Li,Jian Qin,Qiang Xiao",,2023.0

10.1186/s40364-023-00480-x,37095586.0,,Model integrating CT-based radiomics and genomics for survival prediction in esophageal cancer patients receiving definitive chemoradiotherapy,"Abstract Background Definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) is a standard treatment option for locally advanced stage inoperable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Evaluating clinical outcome prior to dCRT remains challenging. This study aimed to investigate the predictive power of computed tomography (CT)-based radiomics combined with genomics for the treatment efficacy of dCRT in ESCC patients. Methods This retrospective study included 118 ESCC patients who received dCRT. These patients were randomly divided into training (n = 82) and validation (n = 36) groups. Radiomic features were derived from the region of the primary tumor on CT images. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was conducted to select optimal radiomic features, and Rad-score was calculated to predict progression-free survival (PFS) in training group. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded pre-treatment biopsy tissue. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were undertaken to identify predictors of survival for model development. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and C-index were used to evaluate the predictive performance and discriminatory ability of the prediction models, respectively. Results The Rad-score was constructed from six radiomic features to predict PFS. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the Rad-score and homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway alterations were independent prognostic factors correlating with PFS. The C-index for the integrated model combining radiomics and genomics was better than that of the radiomics or genomics models in the training group (0.616 vs. 0.587 or 0.557) and the validation group (0.649 vs. 0.625 or 0.586). Conclusion The Rad-score and HRR pathway alterations could predict PFS after dCRT for patients with ESCC, with the combined radiomics and genomics model demonstrating the best predictive efficacy.","Jinfeng Cui,Li Li,Ning Liu,Wei Hou,Yinping Dong,Fang Yang,Shaobo Zhu,Jun Li,Shuanghu Yuan",,2023.0

Methods: In this multicenter study, a total of 563 patients were included from two independent centers. 453 patients from center 1 were split into training and testing cohorts, the remaining 110 from center 2 served as an external validation cohort. Pre-NAT and post-NAT mpMRI was collected for feature extraction. The radiomic models were constructed using machine learning from a training cohort. The accuracy of the models was verified in a testing cohort and an independent external validation cohort. Model performance was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Results: The model constructed with pre-NAT mpMRI had favorable accuracy for prediction of non-response to NAT in the training cohort (AUC = 0.84), testing cohort (AUC = 0.81), and external validation cohort (AUC = 0.79), which outperformed single-sequence MRI. The model constructed with both pre-NAT and post-NAT mpMRI had powerful diagnostic value for pathologic complete response (pCR) in the training cohort (AUC = 0.86), testing cohort (AUC = 0.87), and external validation cohort (AUC = 0.87), which outperformed single-phase mpMRI and MR tumor regression grade for identification of pCR. Conclusions: Models constructed with multiphase and multiparameter MRI were able to predict tumor response to NAT with high accuracy and robustness, which may assist in individualized management of LARC.","Hongyan Huang,Lujun Han,Jian Guo,Yanyu Zhang,Shiu‐Ru Lin,Shengli Chen,Xia Lin,Chen Cheng,Zheng Guo,Yingwei Qiu",,2023.0

The search was restricted to studies published in Q1 clinical radiology journals indexed by Scopus and Web of Science. Following an a priori power analysis based on our null hypothesis, a random sampling of the published literature was conducted. Besides the six baseline study characteristics, a total of three items about publication bias were evaluated. Agreement between raters was analyzed. Disagreements were resolved through consensus. Statistical synthesis of the qualitative evaluations was presented.ResultsFollowing a priori power analysis, we included a random sample of 149 publications in this study. Most of the publications were retrospective (95%; 142/149), based on private data (91%; 136/149), centered on a single institution (75%; 111/149), and lacked external validation (81%; 121/149). Slightly fewer than half (44%; 66/149) made no comparison to non-radiomic approaches. Overall, only one study (1%; 1/149) reported negative results for radiomics, yielding a statistically significant binomial test (p < 0.0001).ConclusionThe top clinical radiology journals almost never publish negative results, having a strong bias toward publishing positive results. Almost half of the publications did not even compare their approach with a non-radiomic method.","Burak Koçak,Elif Bulut,Osman Nuri Bayrak,Ahmet Arda Okumus,Omer Altun,Zeynep Borekci Arvas,Irem Kavukoglu",,2023.0

PI-RADS v2.1 score was assessed by two radiologists. All volumes of interest were segmented on T2-weighted imaging, diffusion weighted imaging, and apparent diffusion coefficient sequences, from which quantitative radiomics features were extracted. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to establish radiomics model for predicting PCa. The diagnostic performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The radiomics model exhibited the best performance in predicting PCa, which was better than the performance of PI-RADS v2.1 scoring by the junior radiologist in the training group [area under the curve (AUC): 0.932 vs 0.803], testing group (AUC: 0.922 vs 0.797), and the entire cohort (AUC: 0.927 vs 0.801) (P < 0.05). The radiomics model performed well for lesions with PI-RADS v2.1 score of 3 (AUC = 0.854, sensitivity = 84.62%, specificity = 84.34%) and PI-RADS v2.1 score of 4-5 (AUC = 0.967, sensitivity = 98.11%, specificity = 86.36%) assigned by junior radiologist. The radiomics model quantitatively outperformed PI-RADS v2.1 for noninvasive prediction of PCa in men with PSA levels of 4-10 ng/mL. The model can help improve the diagnostic performance of junior radiologists and facilitate better decision-making by urologists for management of lesions with different PI-RADS v2.1 score.","Jianguo Zhong,Lin Shi,Jing Liu,Fang Cao,Yanqing Ma,Yang Zhang",,2023.0
10.1109/access.2023.3266771,,,Prediction of Survival of Glioblastoma Patients Using Local Spatial Relationships and Global Structure Awareness in FLAIR MRI Brain Images,"This article introduces a framework for predicting the survival of brain tumor patients by analyzing magnetic resonance images. The prediction of brain tumor survival is challenging due to the limited size of available datasets. To overcome the issue of overfitting, we propose a self-supervised learning method that involves identifying image patches from the same or different images. By recognizing intra- and inter-image differences, the network can learn the relationships between local spatial windows in the same image and across different images. In addition to analyzing local information, we also incorporate a global structure awareness network to capture global information from the entire image. Our proposed method shows a strong correlation between local spatial relationships and survivor class prediction in FLAIR MRI brain images. We evaluate our method using the BraTS 2020 validation dataset and observe that our method outperforms others in accuracy and SpearmanR correlation metrics.","Minh-Trieu Tran,Hyung-Jeong Yang,Soo-Hyung Kim,Guee-Sang Lee",,2023.0

We segmented the 3D volume of interest (VOI) based on malignant lesion of computed tomography (CT) imaging and extracted 1542 radiomics features. Interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and LASSO Cox regression analysis were utilized to perform feature selection and radiomics model building. In the model evaluation phase, we carried out stratified analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, concordance index (C-index), and decision curve analysis (DCA). In addition, integrating the clinicopathological trait and radiomics score, we developed a nomogram to predict the OS at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively.Six radiomics features, including gradient_glcm_InverseVariance, logarithm_firstorder_Median, logarithm_firstorder_RobustMeanAbsoluteDeviation, square_gldm_LargeDependenceEmphasis, wavelet_HLL_firstorder_Kurtosis, and wavelet_LLL_firstorder_Maximum, were selected to construct the radiomics signature, whose areas under the curve (AUCs) for 3-year prediction reached 0.857 in the training set (n=146) and 0.871 in the testing set (n=62). The results of multivariate analysis revealed that the radiomics score, radiological sign, and N stage were independent prognostic factors in NSCLC. Moreover, compared with clinical factors and the separate radiomics model, the established nomogram exhibited a better performance in predicting 3-year OS.Our radiomics model may provide a promising non-invasive approach for preoperative risk stratification and personalized postoperative surveillance for resectable NSCLC patients.","Bo Peng,Kaiyu Wang,Ran Xu,Chuanbin Guo,Tiecheng Lu,Yongchao Li,Yiqiao Wang,Chenghao Wang,Xiaoyan Chang,Zhonghua Shen,Jiaxin Shi,Chengyu Xu,Linyou Zhang",,2023.0

However, despite its research momentum and important advances toward methodological standardization, the translation of radiomics prediction models into clinical practice only progresses slowly. The lack of physicians leading the development of radiomics models and insufficient integration of radiomics tools in the clinical workflow contributes to this slow uptake. Methods We propose a physician-centered vision of radiomics research and derive minimal functional requirements for radiomics research software to support this vision. Free-to-access radiomics tools and frameworks were reviewed to identify best practices and reveal the shortcomings of existing software solutions to optimally support physician-driven radiomics research in a clinical environment. Results Support for user-friendly development and evaluation of radiomics prediction models via machine learning was found to be missing in most tools. QuantImage v2 (QI2) was designed and implemented to address these shortcomings. QI2 relies on well-established existing tools and open-source libraries to realize and concretely demonstrate the potential of a one-stop tool for physician-driven radiomics research. It provides web-based access to cohort management, feature extraction, and visualization and supports “no-code” development and evaluation of machine learning models against patient-specific outcome data. Conclusions QI2 fills a gap in the radiomics software landscape by enabling “no-code” radiomics research, including model validation, in a clinical environment. Further information about QI2, a public instance of the system, and its source code is available at https://medgift.github.io/quantimage-v2-info/ .

This study aimed to develop a radiomics model based on the tree-in-bud (TIB) sign and nodules and validate its predictive performance for MDR-TB. We retrospectively recruited 454 patients with proven active TB from two hospitals and classified them into three training and testing cohorts: TIB (n = 295, 102), nodules (n = 302, 97), and their combination (n = 261, 81). Radiomics features relating to TIB and nodules were separately extracted. The maximal information coefficient and recursive feature elimination were used to select informative features per the two signs. Two radiomics models were constructed to predict MDR-TB using a random forest classifier. Then, a combined model was built incorporating radiomics features based on these two signs. The capability of the models in the combined training and testing cohorts was validated with ROC curves. Sixteen features were extracted from TIB and 15 from nodules. The AUCs of the combined model were slightly higher than those of the TIB model in the combined training cohort (0.911 versus 0.877, p > 0.05) and testing cohort (0.820 versus 0.786, p < 0.05) and similar to the performance of the nodules model in the combined training cohort (0.911 versus 0.933, p > 0.05) and testing cohort (0.820 versus 0.855, p > 0.05). The CT-based radiomics models hold promise for use as a non-invasive tool in the prediction of MDR-TB. Our study revealed that complementary information regarding MDR-TB can be provided by radiomics based on the TIB sign and nodules.

For all patients, 342 radiomic features were extracted from pretreatment computed tomography scans. The training set was built with 110 patients treated at the Léon Bérard Cancer Center. An independent validation cohort was built with the 85 patients treated in Dijon. The two sets were dichotomized into two classes, patients with disease control and those considered non-responders, in order to predict the disease control at 3 months. Various models were trained with different feature selection methods, and different classifiers were evaluated to build the models. In a second exploratory step, we used transcriptomics to enrich the database and develop a multiomic signature of response to immunotherapy in a 54-patient subgroup. Finally, we considered the HOT/COLD status. We first trained a radiomic model to predict the HOT/COLD status and then prototyped a hybrid model integrating radiomics and the HOT/COLD status to predict the response to immunotherapy.Radiomic signature for 3 months' progression-free survival (PFS) classification: The most predictive model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 on the training set and 0.65 on the external validation set. This model was obtained with the t-test selection method and with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Multiomic signature for PFS classification: The most predictive model had an AUROC of 0.95 on the training set and 0.99 on the validation set. Radiomic model to predict the HOT/COLD status: the most predictive model had an AUROC of 0.93 on the training set and 0.86 on the validation set. HOT/COLD radiomic hybrid model for PFS classification: the most predictive model had an AUROC of 0.93 on the training set and 0.90 on the validation set.In conclusion, radiomics could be used to predict the response to immunotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer patients.

The aim was to create a radiomics signature using breast DCE-MRI extracted features to classify tumors and to compare the performances with the BI-RADS classification. Material and methods From September 2017 to December 2019 images, exams and records from consecutive patients with mammary masses on breast DCE-MRI and available histology from one center were retrospectively reviewed (79 patients, 97 masses). Exclusion criterion was malignant uncertainty. The tumors were split in a train-set (70%) and a test-set (30%). From 14 kinetics maps, 89 radiomics features were extracted, for a total of 1246 features per tumor. Feature selection was made using Boruta algorithm, to train a random forest algorithm on the train-set. BI-RADS classification was recorded from two radiologists. Results Seventy-seven patients were analyzed with 94 tumors, (71 malignant, 23 benign). Over 1246 features, 17 were selected from eight kinetic maps. On the test-set, the model reaches an AUC = 0.94 95 CI [0.85–1.00] and a specificity of 33% 95 CI [10–70]. There were 43/94 (46%) lesions BI-RADS4 (4a = 12/94 (13%); 4b = 9/94 (10%); and 4c = 22/94 (23%)). The BI-RADS score reached an AUC = 0.84 95 CI [0.73–0.95] and a specificity of 17% 95 CI [3–56]. There was no significant difference between the ROC curves for the model or the BI-RADS score ( p = 0.19).

Methods A phantom with sixteen clinical-relevant densities was scanned on ten DECT platforms with comparable scan parameters. Ninety-four radiomic features were extracted via Pyradiomics from VUE images and VMIs at energy level of 70 keV (VMI 70keV ). Test–retest repeatability was assessed by Bland–Altman analysis. Inter-platform reproducibility of VUE images and VMI 70keV was evaluated by coefficient of variation (CV) and quartile coefficient of dispersion (QCD) among platforms, and by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) between platform pairs. The correlation between variability of CT number radiomics reproducibility was estimated. Results 92.02% and 92.87% of features were repeatable between scan–rescans for VUE images and VMI 70keV , respectively. Among platforms, 11.30% and 28.39% features of VUE images, and 15.16% and 28.99% features of VMI 70keV were with CV &lt; 10% and QCD &lt; 10%. The average percentages of radiomics features with ICC &gt; 0.90 and CCC &gt; 0.90 between platform pairs were 10.00% and 9.86% in VUE images and 11.23% and 11.23% in VMI 70keV . The CT number inter-platform reproducibility using CV and QCD showed negative correlations with percentage of the first-order radiomics features with CV &lt; 10% and QCD &lt; 10%, in both VUE images and VMI 70keV ( r 2 0.3870–0.6178, all p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions The majority of DECT radiomics features were non-reproducible. The differences in CT number were considered as an indicator of inter-platform DECT radiomics variation.

Head and neck cancers (HNC) are associated with higher recurrence rates, especially in advanced stages of disease. It is considered that approximately 50% of cases will evolve with loco-regional recurrence, even if they will benefit from a current standard treatment consisting of definitive chemo-radiotherapy. Radiotherapy, the cornerstone treatment in locally advanced HNC, could be delivered either by the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique or by the sequential boost technique, the decision often being a subjective one. The principles of radiobiology could be the basis of an optimal decision between the two methods of radiation dose delivery, but the heterogeneity of HNC radio-sensitivity makes this approach difficult. Radiomics has demonstrated the ability to non-invasively predict radio-sensitivity and the risk of relapse in HNC. Tumor heterogeneity evaluated with radiomics, the inclusion of coarseness, entropy and other first order features extracted from gross tumor volume (GTV) in multivariate models could identify pre-treatment cases that will benefit from one of the approaches (SIB or sequential boost radio-chemotherapy) considered the current standard of care for locally advanced HNC. Computer tomography (CT) simulation and daily cone beam CT (CBCT) could be chosen as imaging source for radiomic analysis.","Camil Ciprian Mireştean,Roxana Irina Iancu,Dragoș Petru Teodor Iancu",,2023.0

It is complimentary to small bowel endoscopy that provides mucosal views and allows the delineation of small lesions undetectable on imaging. Surgical resection is the best management modality even in metastatic disease. Prognosis can be improved with the administration of somatostatin analogues and Evarolimus as second-line therapies.NETs are heterogenous tumours affecting most commonly the distal small bowel as single or multiple lesions.

In addition, imaging is the established method of care for detecting, diagnosing, planning treatment, and monitoring the progression of IBD. While conventional imaging techniques are limited in their ability to provide comprehensive information, cross-sectional imaging plays a crucial role in the clinical management of IBD. However, accurately characterizing, detecting, and monitoring fibrosis in Crohn's disease remains a challenging task for clinicians. Recent advances in artificial intelligence technology, machine learning, computational power, and radiomic emergence have enabled the automated evaluation of medical images to generate prognostic biomarkers and quantitative diagnostics. Radiomics analysis can be achieved via deep learning algorithms or by extracting handcrafted radiomics features. As radiomic features capture pathophysiological and biological data, these quantitative radiomic features have been shown to offer accurate and rapid non-invasive tools for IBD diagnostics, treatment response monitoring, and prognosis. For these reasons, the present review aims to provide a comprehensive review of the emerging radiomics methods in intestinal fibrosis research that are highlighted and discussed in terms of challenges and advantages.",Ali S.

This study developed a preoperative model to predict glioma grade and improve the efficacy of clinical strategies by combining these two assessment methods. Materials and Methods Patients diagnosed with glioma between March 2017 and September 2018 who underwent surgery and histopathology were enrolled in this study. A total of 3840 radiomic features were calculated; however, using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method, only 16 features were chosen to generate a radiomic signature. Three predictive models were developed using radiomic features and VASARI standard. The performance and validity of models were evaluated using decision curve analysis and 10-fold nested cross-validation. Results Our study included 102 patients: 35 with low-grade glioma (LGG) and 67 with high-grade glioma (HGG). Model 1 utilized both radiomics and the VASARI standard, which included radiomic signatures, proportion of edema, and deep white matter invasion. Models 2 and 3 were constructed with radiomics or VASARI, respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.937 and 0.831, respectively, which was less than that of Model 1, with an AUC of 0.966.

On the other hand, qualitative imaging will not provide an early diagnosis because the radiologist will perceive brain atrophy on a late disease stage. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to investigate the necessity of quantitative imaging in the assessment of AD by using machine learning (ML) methods. Nowadays, ML methods are used to address high dimensional data, integrate data from different sources, model the etiological and clinical heterogeneity, and discover new biomarkers in the assessment of AD.In this study radiomic features from both entorhinal cortex and hippocampus were extracted from 194 normal controls (NC), 284 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 130 AD subjects. Texture analysis evaluates statistical properties of the image intensities which might represent changes in MRI image pixel intensity due to the pathophysiology of a disease. Therefore, this quantitative method could detect smaller-scale changes of neurodegeneration. Then the radiomics signatures extracted by texture analysis and baseline neuropsychological scales, were used to build an XGBoost integrated model which has been trained and integrated.The model was explained by using the Shapley values produced by the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method. XGBoost produced a f1-score of 0.949, 0.818, and 0.810 between NC vs. AD, MC vs. MCI, and MCI vs. AD, respectively.These directions have the potential to help to the earlier diagnosis and to a better manage of the disease progression and therefore, develop novel treatment strategies. This study clearly showed the importance of explainable ML approach in the assessment of AD.","Stephanos Leandrou,Demetris Lamnisos,Haralabos Bougias,Nikolaos Stogiannos,Eleni Georgiadou,K. G.

The patients may miss the time window of chemotherapy if they were diagnosed PM positive after the gastrectomy. Accurate preoperative prediction of PM in GC patients is vital for prognosis and treatment decisions making. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a 18 F-FDG PET/CT derived radiomics model combining with clinical risk factors for predicting PM of GC. Method In this retrospective study, 410 GC patients (PM - = 281, PM + = 129) who underwent preoperative 18 F-FDG PET/CT images from January 2015 to October 2021 were analyzed. The patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 288) and a validation cohort (n = 122). The maximum relevance and minimum redundancy (mRMR) and the least shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method were applied to select feature. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was preformed to develop the predicting model. Discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness were used to evaluate the performance of the nomogram both in training and validation cohort. Result Fourteen radiomics feature parameters were selected to construct radiomics model. The Area Under Curve (AUC) of the radiomics model were 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.81–0.90) in the training cohort and 0.85 (95%CI, 0.78–0.92) in the validation cohort. After multivariable logistic regression, peritoneal effusion, mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean), carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) and radiomics signature showed statistically significant differences between different PM status patients(P &lt; 0.05). They were chosen to construct the comprehensive predicting model which showed a performance with an AUC of 0.92 (95%CI, 0.89–0.95) in the training cohort and 0.92 (95%CI, 0.86–0.98) in the validation cohort, respectively. Conclusion The nomogram based on 18 F-FDG PET/CT radiomics features and clinical risk factors can be potentially applied in individualized treatment strategy making for gastric cancer patients before the surgery.","Jiexiong Xie,Beihui Xue,Shuying Bian,Xiaowei Ji,Jie Lin,Xiujuan Zheng,Kun Tang",,2023.0

The studies were assessed by radiomics quality score (RQS), transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement, checklist for artificial intelligence in medical imaging (CLAIM), and modified quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) tool. The radiomic features selected for model development were documented.Nine articles were included. The average of the ideal percentage of RQS, the TRIPOD adherence rate and the CLAIM adherence rate were 26%, 56%, and 57%, respectively. The risk of bias and applicability concerns were mainly related to the index test. The shortness in external validation and open science were repeatedly emphasized. In GCTB radiomics models, the gray level co-occurrence matrix features (40%), first order features (28%), and gray-level run-length matrix features (18%) were most selected features out of all reported features. However, none of the individual feature has appeared repeatably in multiple studies. It is not possible to meta-analyze radiomics features at present.The quality of GCTB radiomics studies is suboptimal. The reporting of individual radiomics feature data is encouraged. The analysis at the level of radiomics feature has potential to generate more practicable evidence for translating radiomics into clinical application.","Jingyu Zhong,Yue Xing,Guangcheng Zhang,Yangfan Hu,Defang Ding,Xiang Ge,Pan Zhang,Qian Yin,Huizhen Zhang,Qingcheng Yang,Huan Zhang,Weiwu Yao",,2023.0

The evidence level supporting the radiomics for clinical use was rated. Results We identified 44 systematic reviews with meta-analyses on radiomics research. The mean ± standard deviation of PRISMA adherence rate was 65 ± 9%. The AMSTAR-2 tool rated 5 and 39 systematic reviews as low and critically low confidence, respectively. The ROBIS assessment resulted low, unclear and high risk in 5, 11, and 28 systematic reviews, respectively. We reperformed 53 meta-analyses in 38 included systematic reviews. There were 3, 7, and 43 meta-analyses rated as convincing, highly suggestive, and weak levels of evidence, respectively. The convincing level of evidence was rated in (1) T2-FLAIR radiomics for IDH-mutant vs IDH-wide type differentiation in low-grade glioma, (2) CT radiomics for COVID-19 vs other viral pneumonia differentiation, and (3) MRI radiomics for high-grade glioma vs brain metastasis differentiation. Conclusions The systematic reviews on radiomics were with suboptimal quality. A limited number of radiomics approaches were supported by convincing level of evidence.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 103 patients with histopathologically confirmed advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Three pharmacokinetic parameters, Kep, Ktrans, and Ve, and their radiomics characteristics were obtained by Omni Kinetics software. Immunohistochemical staining was used to determine CD4+ and CD8+ TILs. Statistical analysis was subsequently performed to assess the correlation between radiomics characteristics and CD4+ and CD8+ TIL density. Results: All patients included in this study were finally divided into either a CD8+ TILs low-density group (n = 51) (CD8+ TILs < 138) or a high-density group (n = 52) (CD8+ TILs ≥ 138), and a CD4+ TILs low-density group (n = 51) (CD4+ TILs < 87) or a high-density group (n = 52) (CD4+ TILs ≥ 87). ClusterShade and Skewness based on Kep and Skewness based on Ktrans both showed moderate negative correlation with CD8+ TIL levels (r = 0.630-0.349, p < 0.001), with ClusterShade based on Kep having the highest negative correlation (r = -0.630, p < 0.001). Inertia-based Kep showed a moderate positive correlation with the CD4+ TIL level (r = 0.549, p < 0.001), and the Correlation based on Kep showed a moderate negative correlation with the CD4+ TIL level, which also had the highest correlation coefficient (r = -0.616, p < 0.001). The diagnostic efficacy of the above features was assessed by ROC curves. For CD8+ TILs, ClusterShade of Kep had the highest mean area under the curve (AUC) (0.863). For CD4+ TILs, the Correlation of Kep had the highest mean AUC (0.856). Conclusion: The radiomics features of DCE-MRI are associated with the expression of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in AGC, which have the potential to noninvasively evaluate the expression of CD8+ and CD4+ TILs in AGC patients.","Hong-Yuan Huang,Zhiheng Li,Yunlong Xia,Zhenhua Zhao,Dandan Wang,Hongyan Jin,Fang Liu,Yue Yang,Liyijing Shen,Lu Zhang",,2023.0

According to the histological subtypes of renal cell carcinoma, the test set was further split into clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) set (225 images), renal angiomyolipoma (AML) set (77 images) and set of other subtypes (33 images). Manual segmentation was the gold standard and serves as ground truth. Seven CNN-based models including DeepLabV3+, UNet, UNet++, UNet3+, SegNet, MultilResUNet and Attention UNet were used for automatic segmentation. Python 3.7.0 and Pyradiomics package 3.0.1 were used for radiomic feature extraction. Performance of all approaches was evaluated by the metrics of mean intersection over union (mIOU), dice similarity coefficient (DSC), precision, and recall. Reliability and reproducibility of radiomics features were evaluated by the Pearson coefficient and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).All seven CNN-based models achieved good performance with the mIOU, DSC, precision and recall ranging between 81.97%-93.04%, 78.67%-92.70%, 93.92%-97.56%, and 85.29%-95.17%, respectively. The average Pearson coefficients ranged from 0.81 to 0.95, and the average ICCs ranged from 0.77 to 0.92.

For each LN, 3641 radiomics features were extracted from the region of interest in high-resolution T2WI magnetic resonance imaging before nCRT. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model was used for feature selection and radiomics signature building. A prediction model based on multivariate logistic analysis, combining radiomics signature and selected LN morphologic characteristics, was developed and visualized by drawing a nomogram. The model's performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and calibration curves.The radiomics signature consists of 5 selected features that were effectively discriminated within the training cohort (area under the curve [AUC], 0.908; 95% CI, 0.857%-0.958%) and the validation cohort (AUC, 0.865; 95% CI, 0.757%-0.973%). The nomogram, which consisted of radiomics signature and LN morphologic characteristics (short-axis diameter and border contours), showed better calibration and discrimination in the training and validation cohorts (AUC, 0.925; 95% CI, 0.880%-0.969% and AUC, 0.918; 95% CI, 0.854%-0.983%, respectively). The decision curve analysis confirmed that the nomogram had the highest clinical utility.The nodal-based radiomics model effectively predicts LNs treatment response in patients with LARC after nCRT, which could help personalize treatment plans and guide the implementation of the watch-and-wait approach in these patients.","Siyu Zhang,Bin Tang,Mengchao Yu,Li He,Ping Zheng,Chao Yan,Jie Liu,Qian Peng",,2023.0

However, the complex relationships between radiomics features and the biological characteristics of tumours are yet to be fully determined. In this study, we developed a preclinical cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) radiomics workflow with the aim to use in vivo models to further develop radiomics signatures.CBCT scans of a mouse phantom were acquired using onboard imaging from a small animal radiotherapy research platform (SARRP, Xstrahl). The repeatability and reproducibility of radiomics outputs were compared across different imaging protocols, segmentation sizes, pre-processing parameters and materials. Robust features were identified and used to compare scans of two xenograft mouse tumour models (A549 and H460).Changes to the radiomics workflow significantly impact feature robustness. Preclinical CBCT radiomics analysis is feasible with 119 stable features identified from scans imaged at 60 kV, 25 bin width and 0.26 mm slice thickness. Large variation in segmentation volumes reduced the number of reliable radiomics features for analysis. Standardization in imaging and analysis parameters is essential in preclinical radiomics analysis to improve accuracy of outputs, leading to more consistent and reproducible findings.We present the first optimised workflow for preclinical CBCT radiomics to identify imaging biomarkers. Preclinical radiomics has the potential to maximise the quantity of data captured in in vivo experiments and could provide key information supporting the wider application of radiomics.","Kathryn H.

A total of 460 patients (training cohort, n = 250; test cohort, n = 106; validation cohort, n = 104) with LAGC who were confirmed T3/T4 stage by postoperative pathology were continuously collected retrospectively, including clinical data and preoperative arterial phase computed tomography images (APCT). Dedicated radiomics prototype software was used to segment the lesions and extract features from the preoperative APCT images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to select the extracted radiomics features, and a radiomics score model was constructed. Finally, a prediction model of omental metastases status and a nomogram were constructed combining the radiomics scores and selected clinical features. An area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to validate the capability of the prediction model and nomogram in the training cohort. Calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the prediction model and nomogram. The prediction model was internally validated by the test cohort. In addition, 104 patients from another hospital's clinical and imaging data were gathered for external validation. In the training cohort, the combined prediction (CP) model (AUC 0.871, 95% CI 0.798-0.945) of the radiomics scores combined with the clinical features, compared with clinical features prediction (CFP) model (AUC 0.795, 95% CI 0.710-0.879) and radiomics scores prediction (RSP) model (AUC 0.805, 95% CI 0.730-0.879), had the better predictive ability. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test of the CP model showed that the prediction model did not deviate from the perfect fitting (p = 0.893). In the DCA, the clinical net benefit of the CP model was higher than that of the CFP model and RSP model. In the test and validation cohorts, the AUC values of the CP model were 0.836 (95% CI 0.726-0.945) and 0.779 (95% CI 0.634-0.923), respectively. The preoperative APCT-based clinical-radiomics nomogram showed good performance in predicting omental metastases status in LAGC, which may contribute to clinical decision-making.","Ahao Wu,Changlei Wu,Qingwen Zeng,Yi Cao,Xufeng Shu,Lianghua Luo,Zongfeng Feng,Yi Tu,Zhigang Jie,Yanyan Zhu,Fuqing Zhou,Ya Huang,Zhengrong Li",,2023.0

For performing error simulation, in addition to error-free dose distribution, dose distributions containing nine types of error, including multileaf collimator (MLC) positional errors, gantry rotation errors, radiation output errors and phantom setup errors, were generated. Only error-free data were employed for the model training, and error-free and error data were employed for the tests. As a deep learning model, the variational autoencoder (VAE) was adopted. The anomaly of test data was quantified by calculating Mahalanobis distance based on the feature vectors acquired from a trained encoder. Based on this anomaly, test data were classified as ‘error-free’ or ‘any-error.’ For comparison with conventional approaches, gamma (γ)-analysis was performed, and supervised learning convolutional neural network (S-CNN) was constructed. Receiver operating characteristic curves were obtained to evaluate their performance with the area under the curve (AUC). For all error types, except systematic MLC positional and radiation output errors, the performance of the methods was in the order of S-CNN ˃ VAE-based ˃ γ-analysis (only S-CNN required error data for model training). For example, in random MLC positional error simulation, the AUC of our method, S-CNN and γ-analysis were 0.699, 0.921 and 0.669, respectively. Our results showed that the VAE-based method has the potential to detect errors in patient-specific VMAT QA.","Yuto Kimura,Noriyuki Kadoya,Yohei Oku,Keiichi Jingu",,2023.0
10.1093/noajnl/vdad064,37358938.0,,Dual-center validation of using magnetic resonance imaging radiomics to predict stereotactic radiosurgery outcomes,"Abstract Background MRI radiomic features and machine learning have been used to predict brain metastasis (BM) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) outcomes. Previous studies used only single-center datasets, representing a significant barrier to clinical translation and further research. This study, therefore, presents the first dual-center validation of these techniques. Methods SRS datasets were acquired from 2 centers (n = 123 BMs and n = 117 BMs). Each dataset contained 8 clinical features, 107 pretreatment T1w contrast-enhanced MRI radiomic features, and post-SRS BM progression endpoints determined from follow-up MRI. Random decision forest models were used with clinical and/or radiomic features to predict progression. 250 bootstrap repetitions were used for single-center experiments. Results Training a model with one center’s dataset and testing it with the other center’s dataset required using a set of features important for outcome prediction at both centers, and achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values up to 0.70. A model training methodology developed using the first center’s dataset was locked and externally validated with the second center’s dataset, achieving a bootstrap-corrected AUC of 0.80. Lastly, models trained on pooled data from both centers offered balanced accuracy across centers with an overall bootstrap-corrected AUC of 0.78. Conclusions Using the presented validated methodology, radiomic models trained at a single center can be used externally, though they must utilize features important across all centers. These models’ accuracies are inferior to those of models trained using each individual center’s data. Pooling data across centers shows accurate and balanced performance, though further validation is required.","David A DeVries,Terence Tang,Ghada Alqaidy,Ali Albweady,Andrew Leung,Joanna Laba,F.

Assessments from 537 readers interpreting 239 normal mammograms were used to categorise cases as 120 difficult-to-interpret and 119 easy-to-interpret based on cases having the highest and lowest difficulty scores, respectively. Using lattice- and squared-based approaches, 34 handcrafted GRFs per image were extracted and normalised. Three classifiers were constructed: (i) CC and (ii) MLO using the GRFs from corresponding craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique images only, based on the random forest technique for distinguishing difficult- from easy-to-interpret NCs, and (iii) CC + MLO using the median predictive scores from both CC and MLO models. Useful GRFs for the CC and MLO models were recognised using a scree test. The CC and MLO models were trained and validated using the leave-one-out-cross-validation. The models' performances were assessed by the AUC and compared using the DeLong test. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine if the 34 GRFs differed between difficult- and easy-to-interpret NCs and if difficulty level based on the traditional breast density (BD) categories differed among 115 low-BD and 124 high-BD NCs. The CC + MLO model achieved higher performance (0.71 AUC) than the individual CC and MLO model alone (0.66 each), but statistically non-significant difference was found (all p > 0.05). Six GRFs were identified to be valuable in describing difficult-to-interpret NCs. Twenty features, when compared between difficult- and easy-to-interpret NCs, differed significantly (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in difficulty between low- and high-BD NCs (p = 0.709). GRF mammographic analysis can predict difficult-to-interpret NCs.","Somphone Siviengphanom,Ziba Gandomkar,Sarah Lewis,Patrick C. Brennan",,2023.0

Methods Data on neuroblastic tumors in 104 children were retrospectively analyzed. There were 14 cases of ganglioneuroma, 24 cases of ganglioneuroblastoma, and 65 cases of neuroblastoma. Stratified sampling was used to randomly allocate the cases into the training and validation sets in a ratio of 3:1. The maximum relevance–minimum redundancy algorithm was used to identify the top 10 of two clinical features and 851 radiomic features in portal venous–phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography images. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was used to classify tumors in two binary steps: first as ganglioneuroma compared to the other two types, then as ganglioneuroblastoma compared to neuroblastoma. Results Based on 10 clinical-radiomic features, the classifier identified ganglioneuroma compared to the other two tumor types in the validation dataset with sensitivity of 100.0%, specificity of 81.8%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.875. The classifier identified ganglioneuroblastoma versus neuroblastoma with a sensitivity of 83.3%, a specificity of 87.5%, and an AUC of 0.854. The overall accuracy of the classifier across all three types of tumors was 80.8%.

However, little has been done regarding the valid subtyping of prodromal PD, which hinders the early diagnosis of PD. Therefore, we aimed to identify the subtypes of prodromal PD using the brain radiomics-based network and examine the unique patterns linked to the clinical presentations of each subtype. Individualized brain radiomics-based network was constructed for normal controls (NC; N = 110), prodromal PD patients ( N = 262), and PD patients ( N = 108). Data-driven clustering approach using the radiomics-based network was carried out to cluster prodromal PD patients into higher-/lower-risk subtypes. Then, the dissociated patterns of clinical manifestations, anatomical structure alterations, and gene expression between these two subtypes were evaluated. Clustering findings indicated that one prodromal PD subtype closely resembled the pattern of NCs (N-P; N = 159), while the other was similar to the pattern of PD (P-P; N = 103). Significant differences were observed between the subtypes in terms of multiple clinical measurements, neuroimaging for morphological changes, and gene enrichment for synaptic transmission. Identification of prodromal PD subtypes based on brain connectomes and a full understanding of heterogeneity at this phase could inform early and accurate PD diagnosis and effective neuroprotective interventions.","Hua Lin,Caili Huang,Fei Gao,Zhen Yuan",,2023.0

Radiomic features were extracted from Intra and Peri regions on the metastatic cervical lymph node, and selected with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to build radiomic models. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics were employed to evaluate the predictive power of each model.The AUCs of the radiomic model of Intra, Peri, Intra + Peri, and Clinical-radiomic were 0.910, 0.887, 0.934, and 0.941, respectively, in the training set and 0.737, 0.794, 0.774, and 0.783, respectively, in the validation set. There were no significant differences in prediction performance among the radiomic models in the training and validation sets (all P > 0.05). The calibration curve of the radiomic model of Peri demonstrated good agreement between prediction and observation in the training and validation sets.The pretreatment MRI-based radiomics model may be useful in predicting the treatment response of metastatic lymph nodes of NPC.

Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on 134 patients who underwent abdominal multiphase spiral CT scans in three local tertiary hospitals between March 2015 and November 2022. The analysis included 74 cases of LPA (52 at our hospital and 22 at other hospitals) and 60 cases of sPHEO (44 at our hospital and 16 at other hospitals), all of which were surgically and pathologically confirmed. Tumors were delineated using 3D Slicer and radiomics were extracted using PyRadiomics, a plug-in to the software. Cases from internal hospital were randomly split into training and test sets in a 7:3 ratio, while all cases from external hospitals were used as the validation set. The T-test and the minimum absolute contraction and selection operator (LASSO) were used to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Then six dichotomous models were developed, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The diagnostic performance of each model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC). The ROC curves of the test and validation sets were compared using DeLong's method to determine the most effective model for distinguishing between LPA and sPHEO. Results A total of 902 rows and 112 columns of radiomic feature data were extracted from multiple phases and slice-thickness CT data. After dimensionality reduction processing, 13 - dimensional radiomic feature data was obtained. The six binary models demonstrated good diagnostic performance for each phase and slice thickness, as well as for the entire CT data, with AUC values ranging from 0.706 to 1. Among these models, RF, SVM, and MLP showed particularly good diagnostic performance. The ROC curves of RF, SVM, and MLP did not show a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) for different phase, slice-thicknesses, as well as the entire test and validation sets, except for the thick slice-thickness data sets. The AUC value of the MLP model for the non-contrast CT validation set was 0.979, which is quite high. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the ROC curves when compared to other phases and the entire validation sets (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions The CT radiomics-based machine learning model was able to differentiate between LPA and sPHEO well, even using non-contrast CT data alone to efficiently discriminate between the two.","D.

Tumor ablation with either radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or microwave ablation (MWA) is recommended as a curative-intent treatment for early-stage HCC. Given the widespread use of thermal ablation in routine clinical practice, accurate evaluation of treatment response and patient outcomes has become crucial in optimizing individualized management strategies. Noninvasive imaging occupies the central role in the routine management of patients with HCC. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could provide full wealth of information with respect to tumor morphology, hemodynamics, function and metabolism. With accumulation of liver MR imaging data, radiomics analysis has been increasingly applied to capture tumor heterogeneity and provide prognostication by extracting high-throughput quantitative imaging features from digital medical images. Emerging evidence suggests the potential role of several qualitative, quantitative and radiomic MRI features in prediction of treatment response and patient prognosis after ablation of HCC. Understanding the advancements of MRI in the evaluation of ablated HCCs may facilitate optimal patient care and improved outcomes. This review provides an overview of the emerging role of MRI in treatment response evaluation and prognostication of HCC patients undergoing ablation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: MRI-based parameters can help predict treatment response and patient prognosis after HCC ablation and thus guide treatment planning. KEY POINTS: 1. ECA-MRI provides morphological and hemodynamic assessment of ablated HCC. 2. EOB-MRI provides more information for tumor response prediction after ablation. 3.

Recent advances in ML have enabled the integration of wider ranges of data including both medical records and imaging (radiomics). However, the development of prognostic models is complex as no modeling strategy is universally superior to others and validation of developed models requires large and diverse datasets to demonstrate that prognostic models developed (regardless of method) from one dataset are applicable to other datasets both internally and externally. Using a retrospective dataset of 2,552 patients from a single institution and a strict evaluation framework that included external validation on three external patient cohorts (873 patients), we crowdsourced the development of ML models to predict overall survival in head and neck cancer (HNC) using electronic medical records (EMR) and pretreatment radiological images. To assess the relative contributions of radiomics in predicting HNC prognosis, we compared 12 different models using imaging and/or EMR data. The model with the highest accuracy used multitask learning on clinical data and tumor volume, achieving high prognostic accuracy for 2-year and lifetime survival prediction, outperforming models relying on clinical data only, engineered radiomics, or complex deep neural network architecture. However, when we attempted to extend the best performing models from this large training dataset to other institutions, we observed significant reductions in the performance of the model in those datasets, highlighting the importance of detailed population-based reporting for AI/ML model utility and stronger validation frameworks. We have developed highly prognostic models for overall survival in HNC using EMRs and pretreatment radiological images based on a large, retrospective dataset of 2,552 patients from our institution.Diverse ML approaches were used by independent investigators. The model with the highest accuracy used multitask learning on clinical data and tumor volume.External validation of the top three performing models on three datasets (873 patients) with significant differences in the distributions of clinical and demographic variables demonstrated significant decreases in model performance. Significance: ML combined with simple prognostic factors outperformed multiple advanced CT radiomics and deep learning methods.

Although tissue-based biomarkers (eg, PD-L1) are limited by suboptimal performance, tissue availability, and tumour heterogeneity, radiographic images might holistically capture the underlying cancer biology. We aimed to investigate the application of deep learning on chest CT scans to derive an imaging signature of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors and evaluate its added value in the clinical context.MethodsIn this retrospective modelling study, 976 patients with metastatic, EGFR/ALK negative NSCLC treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors at MD Anderson and Stanford were enrolled from Jan 1, 2014, to Feb 29, 2020. We built and tested an ensemble deep learning model on pretreatment CTs (Deep-CT) to predict overall survival and progression-free survival after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We also evaluated the added predictive value of the Deep-CT model in the context of existing clinicopathological and radiological metrics.FindingsOur Deep-CT model demonstrated robust stratification of patient survival of the MD Anderson testing set, which was validated in the external Stanford set. The performance of the Deep-CT model remained significant on subgroup analyses stratified by PD-L1, histology, age, sex, and race. In univariate analysis, Deep-CT outperformed the conventional risk factors, including histology, smoking status, and PD-L1 expression, and remained an independent predictor after multivariate adjustment. Integrating the Deep-CT model with conventional risk factors demonstrated significantly improved prediction performance, with overall survival C-index increases from 0·70 (clinical model) to 0·75 (composite model) during testing. On the other hand, the deep learning risk scores correlated with some radiomics features, but radiomics alone could not reach the performance level of deep learning, indicating that the deep learning model effectively captured additional imaging patterns beyond known radiomics features.InterpretationThis proof-of-concept study shows that automated profiling of radiographic scans through deep learning can provide orthogonal information independent of existing clinicopathological biomarkers, bringing the goal of precision immunotherapy for patients with NSCLC closer.FundingNational Institutes of Health, Mark Foundation Damon Runyon Foundation Physician Scientist Award, MD Anderson Strategic Initiative Development Program, MD Anderson Lung Moon Shot Program, Andrea Mugnaini, and Edward L C Smith.","Maliazurina Saad,Lingzhi Hong,Muhammad Aminu,Natalie I.

Nonetheless, the conventional attributes of radiological features, including morphology, size, margin, density, signal intensity, and echoes, limit their clinical utility. Radiomics is a widely used approach that is characterized by the extraction of copious image features from radiographic depictions, which gives it considerable potential in addressing this limitation. It is worth noting that functional or molecular alterations occur significantly prior to the morphological shifts discernible by imaging modalities. Consequently, the explication of potential mechanisms by multiomics analyses (encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) is essential for investigating putative signal pathway regulations from a radiological viewpoint. In this review, we elaborate on the principal pathological categorizations of diffuse liver diseases, the evaluation of multiomics approaches pertaining to diffuse liver diseases, and the prospective value of predictive models. Accordingly, the overarching objective of this review is to scrutinize the interrelations between radiological features and bioinformatics as well as to consider the development of prediction models predicated on radiobioinformatics as integral components of clinical decision support systems for diffuse liver diseases.","Pinggui Lei,Na Hu,Yuhui Wu,Min Tang,Chong Lin,Luoyi Kong,Lingfeng Zhang,Peng Luo,Lawrence Chan",,2023.0

However, it is challenging to accurately identify patients who may benefit from ICIs. Current biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of ICIs require pathological slides, and their accuracy is limited. Here we aim to develop a radiomics model that could accurately predict response of ICIs for patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC). Methods Pretreatment contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) image and clinicopathological features of 240 patients with ABC who underwent ICIs-based treatment in three academic hospitals from February 2018 to January 2022 were assigned into a training cohort and an independent validation cohort. For radiomic features extraction, CECT images of patients 1 month prior to ICIs-based therapies were first delineated with regions of interest. Data dimension reduction, feature selection and radiomics model construction were carried out with multilayer perceptron. Combined the radiomics signatures with independent clinicopathological characteristics, the model was integrated by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results Among the 240 patients, 171 from Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital and Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were evaluated as a training cohort, while other 69 from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center and the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University were the validation cohort. The area under the curve (AUC) of radiomics model was 0.994 (95% CI: 0.988 to 1.000) in the training and 0.920 (95% CI: 0.824 to 1.000) in the validation set, respectively, which were significantly better than the performance of clinical model (0.672 for training and 0.634 for validation set). The integrated clinical-radiomics model showed increased but not statistical different predictive ability in both the training (AUC=0.997, 95% CI: 0.993 to 1.000) and validation set (AUC=0.961, 95% CI: 0.885 to 1.000) compared with the radiomics model. Furthermore, the radiomics model could divide patients under ICIs-therapies into high-risk and low-risk group with significantly different progression-free survival both in training (HR=2.705, 95% CI: 1.888 to 3.876, p&lt;0.001) and validation set (HR=2.625, 95% CI: 1.506 to 4.574, p=0.001), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the radiomics model was not influenced by programmed death-ligand 1 status, tumor metastatic burden or molecular subtype. Conclusions This radiomics model provided an innovative and accurate way that could stratify patients with ABC who may benefit more from ICIs-based therapies.","Jianli Zhao,Zhixian Sun,Yunfang Yu,Zhongyu Yuan,Ying Lin,Yongtao Tan,Xiaohui Duan,Herui Yao,Ying Wang,Jieqiong Liu",,2023.0

10.53011/jmro.2023.01.03,,,Radiomics Breakthrough Could Spark the Head and Neck Cancer Radiotherapy Revolution,"Radiomics, the method by which digital images could be transformed into mineable data, opens new horizons for biomedical research and in particular in oncology, for diagnostic, predictive and prognostic purposes. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in the radiomics algorithm makes radiomics and AI two inseparable, intricate domains. AI defined as machine capability of imitating human intelligence, has already been implemented on a large scale in oncology and radiotherapy. One of the two main branches (the virtual one) of machine learning depending on the application, artificial intelligence is involved both in the diagnostics processes as well as treatment planning, – dose delivery and radiotherapy quality assurance (QA). Head and neck cancer (HNC), although it is the 6th malignancy in incidence worldwide, is redoubtable due to the high rate of therapeutic failures, especially of loco-regional recurrence. Although intensity-modulated treatment techniques have brought benefits especially in limiting the toxicities associated with irradiation, AI and especially radiomics, due the possibility to extract data from high-resolution medical imaging in order to build predictive diagnostic and prognostic models, could upgrade the technological revolution in HNC radiotherapy at a higher level. Beyond the already intensively studied diagnostic applications, radiomics could be useful for predicting the response to radio-chemotherapy, anticipating treatment related toxicities and for pre-therapeutic evaluation of the need for adaptive radiotherapy (ART). Clinical-radiomic models have superior predictive power and the delta variation of radiomic features could be a biomarker still less evaluated. Due to characteristics of modern radiotherapy which includes as standard the image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) concept using the computer tomography (CT) simulator and Cone Beam CT (CBCT) to ensure the accuracy of the patient’s positioning during the treatment, radiomics in radiotherapy could be the spearhead of the translation radiomics in daily clinical routine and of the HNC RGRT concept development.","Camil Ciprian Mireştean,Roxana Irina Iancu,Dragoș Petru Teodor Iancu",,2023.0
10.1038/s41698-023-00413-9,37337080.0,,Radiomics for characterization of the glioma immune microenvironment,"Abstract Increasing evidence suggests that besides mutational and molecular alterations, the immune component of the tumor microenvironment also substantially impacts tumor behavior and complicates treatment response, particularly to immunotherapies. Although the standard method for characterizing tumor immune profile is through performing integrated genomic analysis on tissue biopsies, the dynamic change in the immune composition of the tumor microenvironment makes this approach not feasible, especially for brain tumors. Radiomics is a rapidly growing field that uses advanced imaging techniques and computational algorithms to extract numerous quantitative features from medical images. Recent advances in machine learning methods are facilitating biological validation of radiomic signatures and allowing them to “mine” for a variety of significant correlates, including genetic, immunologic, and histologic data. Radiomics has the potential to be used as a non-invasive approach to predict the presence and density of immune cells within the microenvironment, as well as to assess the expression of immune-related genes and pathways. This information can be essential for patient stratification, informing treatment decisions and predicting patients’ response to immunotherapies. This is particularly important for tumors with difficult surgical access such as gliomas. In this review, we provide an overview of the glioma microenvironment, describe novel approaches for clustering patients based on their tumor immune profile, and discuss the latest progress on utilization of radiomics for immune profiling of glioma based on current literature.","Neda Khalili,Anahita Fathi Kazerooni,Ariana Familiar,Debanjan Haldar,Adam Kraya,Jessica Foster,Mateusz Koptyra,Phillip B.

Our purpose was to explore the potential of radiomics for SCCHN therapy-specific survival prognostication and to increase the models’ interpretability by ranking the features based on their predictive importance. Methods We included 157 SCCHN patients (male, 119; female, 38; mean age, 64.39 ± 10.71 years) with baseline head and neck CT between 09/2014 and 08/2020 in this retrospective study. Patients were stratified according to their treatment. Using independent training and test datasets with cross-validation and 100 iterations, we identified, ranked and inter-correlated prognostic signatures using elastic net (EN) and random survival forest (RSF). We benchmarked the models against clinical parameters. Inter-reader variation was analyzed using intraclass-correlation coefficients (ICC). Results EN and RSF achieved top prognostication performances of AUC = 0.795 (95% CI 0.767–0.822) and AUC = 0.811 (95% CI 0.782–0.839). RSF prognostication slightly outperformed the EN for the complete (ΔAUC 0.035, p = 0.002) and radiochemotherapy (ΔAUC 0.092, p &lt; 0.001) cohort. RSF was superior to most clinical benchmarking ( p ≤ 0.006). The inter-reader correlation was moderate or high for all features classes (ICC ≥ 0.77 (± 0.19)). Shape features had the highest prognostic importance, followed by texture features. Conclusions EN and RSF built on radiomics features may be used for survival prognostication. The prognostically leading features may vary between treatment subgroups. This warrants further validation to potentially aid clinical treatment decision making in the future.","Simon Bernatz,Ines Böth,Jörg Ackermann,Iris Burck,Scherwin Mahmoudi,Lukas Lenga,Simon S.

10.1364/boe.493524,37342689.0,,Raman spectromics method for fast and label-free genotype screening,"It is now understood that genes and their various mutations are associated with the onset and progression of diseases. However, routine genetic testing techniques are limited by their high cost, time consumption, susceptibility to contamination, complex operation, and data analysis difficulties, rendering them unsuitable for genotype screening in many cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a rapid, sensitive, user-friendly, and cost-effective method for genotype screening and analysis. In this study, we propose and investigate a Raman spectroscopic method for achieving fast and label-free genotype screening. The method was validated using spontaneous Raman measurements of wild-type Cryptococcus neoformans and its six mutants. An accurate identification of different genotypes was achieved by employing a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), and significant correlations between metabolic changes and genotypic variations were revealed. Genotype-specific regions of interest were also localized and visualized using a gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM)-based spectral interpretable analysis method. Furthermore, the contribution of each metabolite to the final genotypic decision-making was quantified. The proposed Raman spectroscopic method demonstrated huge potential for fast and label-free genotype screening and analysis of conditioned pathogens.","Shanshan Zhu,Yanjian Li,Fengdi Zhang,Chengjie Xiong,Han Gao,Yu-Dong Yao,Wei Qian,Chen Ding,Shuo Chen",,2023.0

Radiomics is an emerging technique for image information analysis, while it has not yet been applied to construct a differential diagnostic model between SNPM and SPLC in patients with CRC. In the present study, we aimed to extract radiomics signatures from thin-section computed tomography (CT) images of the chest. These radiomics signatures were combined with clinical features to construct a composite differential diagnostic model.A total of 91 patients with CRC, including 66 patients with SNPM and 25 patients with SPLC, were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to the training cohort (n = 63) and validation cohort (n = 28) at a ratio of 7 to 3. Moreover, 107 radiomics features were extracted from the chest thin-section CT images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to filter these features, and clinical features were screened by univariate analysis. The screened radiomics and clinical features were combined to construct a multifactorial logistic regression composite model. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were adopted to evaluate the models, and the corresponding nomograms were created.A series of 6 radiomics characteristics was screened by LASSO. After univariate logistic regression analysis, the composite model finally included 4 radiomics features and 4 clinical features. In the training cohort, the area under the curve scores of ROC curves were 0.912 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.813-0.969), 0.884 (95% CI: 0.778-0.951), and 0.939 (95% CI: 0.848-0.984) for models derived from radiomics, clinical, and combined features, respectively.

Radiomics features were extracted from the non-tumorous liver tissue at the gadoxetic-acid-enhanced hepatobiliary phase MRI. The reproducible and non-redundant features were selected for consensus clustering analysis to detect distinct subgroups. After that, clinical variables were compared between the identified subgroups to evaluate the clustering efficacy. The liver function reserve of the subgroups was compared and the correlations between the subgroups and PHLF, postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay were evaluated.A total of 107 radiomics features were extracted and 37 were selected for unsupervised clustering analysis, which identified two distinct subgroups (138 patients in each subgroup). Compared with subgroup 1, subgroup 2 had significantly more patients with older age, albumin-bilirubin grades 2 and 3, a higher indocyanine green retention rate, and a lower indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate (all p < 0.05). Subgroup 2 was also associated with a higher risk of PHLF, postoperative complications, and longer hospital stays (>18 days) than that of subgroup 1, with an odds ratio of 2.83 (95% CI: 1.58-5.23), 2.41(95% CI: 1.15-5.35), and 2.14 (95% CI: 1.32-3.47), respectively.

Reference standard was the mutational status of tyrosine-protein kinase (KIT) and platelet-derived growth factor α (PDGFRA). Patients were dichotomized in imatinib sensitive (group 0 - mutation in KIT or PDGFRA, different from exon 18-D842V), and imatinib non-responsive (group 1 - PDGFRA exon 18-D842V mutation or absence of mutation in KIT/PDGFRA). Initially, 107 texture features were extracted from the tumor masks of baseline computed tomography scans.

Invasive methods, such as mediastinoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA), are employed for preoperative LN staging. Among the preoperative non-invasive diagnostic methods, computed tomography (CT) and, recently, positron emission tomography (PET)/CT with fluorine-18-fludeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) are routinely recommended by several guidelines; however, they can both miss pathologically proven LN metastases, with an incidence up to 26% for patients staged with [18F]FDG PET/CT. These undetected metastases, known as occult LN metastases (OLMs), are usually cases of micro-metastasis or small LN metastasis (shortest radius below 10 mm). Hence, it is crucial to find novel approaches to increase their discovery rate. Radiomics is an emerging field that seeks to uncover and quantify the concealed information present in biomedical images by utilising machine or deep learning approaches. The extracted features can be integrated into predictive models, as numerous reports have emphasised their usefulness in the staging of lung cancer.

The aim of this study was to develop robust radiomics models for predicting the prognosis of HIFU-treated uterine fibroids and to explain the internal predictive process of the model using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). Methods This retrospective study included 300 patients with uterine fibroids who received HIFU and were classified as having a favorable or unfavorable prognosis based on the postoperative nonperfusion volume ratio. Patients were divided into a training set ( N = 240) and a test set ( N = 60). The 1295 radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI) scans. After data preprocessing and feature filtering, radiomics models were constructed by extreme gradient boosting and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and the optimal performance was obtained by Bayesian optimization. Finally, the SHAP approach was used to explain the internal prediction process. Results The models constructed using LightGBM had the best performance, and the AUCs of the T2WI and CE-T1WI models were 87.2 (95% CI = 87.1–87.5) and 84.8 (95% CI = 84.6–85.7), respectively. The use of SHAP technology can help physicians understand the impact of radiomic features on the predicted outcomes of the model from a global and individual perspective. Conclusion Multiparametric radiomic models have shown their robustness in predicting HIFU prognosis. Radiomic features can be a potential source of biomarkers to support preoperative assessment of HIFU treatment and improve the understanding of uterine fibroid heterogeneity. Clinical relevance statement An interpretable radiomics model can help clinicians to effectively predict the prognosis of HIFU treatment for uterine fibroids. The heterogeneity of fibroids can be characterized by various radiomics features and the application of SHAP can be used to visually explain the prediction process of radiomics models.

Radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images. Machine learning algorithms including multiple logistic regression (MLR), supporting vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) were applied to construct the predictive model. A nomogram was further built to visualize the possibility of RPS6K expression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) was used to evaluate the performance of diagnostic models. 174 radiomics features were confirmed correlated with RPS6K expression. Amongst all built models, the ANN-based hybrid model exhibited best predictive ability with AUC of 0.887 and 0.826 in training and validation cohorts. ALB was identified as the key clinical index, and the nomogram displayed further improved ability with AUC of 0.917 and 0.845. In this study, we proved MRI-based radiomics model and nomogram can accurately predict RPS6K expression non-invasively, thus providing help for clinical decision making for mTORi therapy.","Fan Yang,Yidong Wan,Xiaoyong Shen,Yichao Wu,Lei Xu,Jinwen Meng,Jianguo Wang,Zhikun Liu,Jun Chen,Di Lu,Xue Wang,Shusen Zheng,Tianye Niu,Xiao Xu",,2023.0

Although imaging remains pivotal to assess response to PST accurately, the use of imaging to predict response to PST has the potential to not only better prognostication but also allow the de-escalation or omission of potentially toxic treatment with undesirable adverse effects, the accelerated implementation of new targeted therapies, and the mitigation of surgical delays in selected patients. In response to the limited ability of radiologists to predict response to PST via qualitative, subjective assessments of tumors on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), artificial intelligence-enhanced MRI with classical machine learning, and in more recent times, deep learning, have been used with promising results to predict response, both before the start of PST and in the early stages of treatment. This review provides an overview of the current applications of artificial intelligence to MRI in assessing and predicting response to PST, and discusses the challenges and limitations of their clinical implementation.","Roberto Lo Gullo,Eric Marcus,Jorge Huayanay,Sarah Eskreis‐Winkler,Sunitha B.

The current review aimed to summarize the current clinical articles about 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics-based ML analyses to solve issues in classifying or constructing prediction models for several types of tumors. In these studies, lung and mediastinal tumors were the most commonly evaluated lesions, followed by lymphatic, abdominal, head and neck, breast, gynecological, and other types of tumors. Previous studies have commonly shown that 18F-FDG PET radiomics-based ML analysis has good performance in differentiating benign from malignant tumors, predicting tumor characteristics and stage, therapeutic response, and prognosis by examining significant differences in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves, accuracies, or concordance indices (> 0.70). However, these studies have reported several ML algorithms. Moreover, different ML models have been applied for the same purpose. Thus, various procedures were used in 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics-based ML analysis in oncology, and 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics-based ML models, which are easy and universally applied in clinical practice, would be expected to be established.","Masatoyo Nakajo,Megumi Jinguji,Shigeaki Ito,Atushi Tani,Mitsuho Hirahara,Takashi Yamada",,2023.0

All patients underwent MRI examinations, and the same parameters were used. The lesion area was manually delineated and the radiomics features were extracted from T2WI. The radiomics signature based on LASSO regression was established. Besides, logistic regression was used to identify independent clinical predictors, and a combined model incorporating the radiomics signature and independent clinical risk factor was constructed. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to compare the prediction efficiency and clinical benefit of each model.A total of 867 radiomics features were obtained, and six of them were incorporated into the radiomics model. Multivariate logistic regression analysis exhibited the Gleason score as an independent clinical risk factor for PCa invasion. ROC results showed that the performance of the radiomics model was comparable to that of the clinical-radiomics model in predicting PCa invasion, and it was better than that of the single Gleason score.

However, one of the main limitations of these systems is the generalizability and reproducibility of results when they are applied to images acquired in different hospitals by different scanners. Normalization has been introduced to mitigate this issue, and two main approaches have been proposed: one rescales the image intensities (image normalization), the other the feature distributions for each center (feature normalization). The aim of this study is to evaluate how different image and feature normalization methods impact the robustness of 93 radiomics features acquired using a multicenter and multi-scanner abdominal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) dataset. To this scope, 88 rectal MRIs were retrospectively collected from 3 different institutions (4 scanners), and for each patient, six 3D regions of interest on the obturator muscle were considered. The methods applied were min-max, 1st-99th percentiles and 3-Sigma normalization, z-score standardization, mean centering, histogram normalization, Nyul-Udupa and ComBat harmonization. The Mann-Whitney U-test was applied to assess features repeatability between scanners, by comparing the feature values obtained for each normalization method, including the case in which no normalization was applied. Most image normalization methods allowed to reduce the overall variability in terms of intensity distributions, while worsening or showing unpredictable results in terms of feature robustness, except for thez-score, which provided a slight improvement by increasing the number of statistically similar features from 9/93 to 10/93. Conversely, feature normalization methods positively reduced the overall variability across the scanners, in particular, 3sigma,z_scoreandComBatthat increased the number of similar features (79/93). According to our results, it emerged that none of the image normalization methods was able to strongly increase the number of statistically similar features.","Valentina Giannini,Jovana Panić,Daniele Regge,Gabriella Balestra,Samanta Rosati",,2023.0

It determines the structure, function and dynamics of organisms through collective characterization and quantification of biological molecules. The diagnostic imaging modalities have peaked in their advancements, leading to escalated complexity and volume of database. This has ushered the foundation of a novel approach to imaging diagnosis called radiomics. Radiomics refers to the accentuation and procurement of ambiguous data from medical imaging and has been applied within oncology to enhance diagnosis and prognostication, aiding in clinical decision, with the aim of delivering precision medicine. The chief application of radiomics is in oncology to augment diagnosis and prognosis, thereby improving clinical decision. Consequently, the success rates for delivering precision medicine is higher as it facilitates the procurement and accentuation of ambiguous data from rradiographs. Radiologists as well as data and imaging scientists represent an integral part of the interdisciplinary workflow of radiomics. It involves a comprehensive process of step by step tumour segmentation, image pre-processing, feature extraction, analysis, model development, and validation. By this paramount potentiality, it serves as a definitive solution for both clinical and research purposes. This paper highlights the role of radiomics in defining, standardization, and cultivating vast databases accessible to clinicians.

Patients with HCC choose postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (PA-TACE) after surgical resection to reduce the risk of recurrence. However, many of them have recurrence within a short period.In this retrospective analysis, a total of 173 patients who underwent PA-TACE between September 2016 and March 2020 were recruited. Radiomic features were derived from the arterial and venous phases of each patient. Early recurrence (ER)-related radiomics features of HCC and the spleen were selected to build two rad-scores using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis. Logistic regression was applied to establish the Radiation (Rad)_score by combining the two regions. We constructed a nomogram containing clinical information and dual-region rad-scores, which was evaluated in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness.All three radiological scores showed good performance for ER prediction. The combined Rad_score performed the best, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.853 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.783-0.908) in the training set and 0.929 (95% CI, 0.789-0.988) in the validation set.

10.1007/s11547-023-01681-y,37474665.0,,Introducing a secondary segmentation to construct a radiomics model for pulmonary tuberculosis cavities,"Abstract Purpose Accurate segmentation (separating diseased portions of the lung from normal appearing lung) is a challenge in radiomic studies of non-neoplastic diseases, such as pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). In this study, we developed a segmentation method, applicable to chest X-rays (CXR), that can eliminate the need for precise disease delineation, and that is effective for constructing radiomic models for automatic PTB cavity classification. Methods This retrospective study used a dataset of 266 posteroanterior CXR of patients diagnosed with laboratory confirmed PTB. The lungs were segmented using a U-net-based in-house automatic segmentation model. A secondary segmentation was developed using a sliding window, superimposed on the primary lung segmentation. Pyradiomics was used for feature extraction from every window which increased the dimensionality of the data, but this allowed us to accurately capture the spread of the features across the lung. Two separate measures (standard-deviation and variance) were used to consolidate the features. Pearson’s correlation analysis (with a 0.8 cut-off value) was then applied for dimensionality reduction followed by the construction of Random Forest radiomic models. Results Two almost identical radiomic signatures consisting of 10 texture features each (9 were the same plus 1 other feature) were identified using the two separate consolidation measures. Two well performing random forest models were constructed from these signatures. The standard-deviation model (AUC = 0.9444 (95% CI, 0.8762; 0.9814)) performed marginally better than the variance model (AUC = 0.9288 (95% CI, 0.9046; 0.9843)). Conclusion The introduction of the secondary sliding window segmentation on CXR could eliminate the need for disease delineation in pulmonary radiomic studies, and it could improve the accuracy of CXR reporting currently regaining prominence as a high-volume screening tool as the developed radiomic models correctly classify cavities from normal CXR.","Tamarisk Du Plessis,Gopika Ramkilawon,William Rae,Tanita Botha,Neil Martinson,Steve Dixon,Andre Kyme,Mike Sathekge",,2023.0

This study combined radiomics analysis with the uptake of 99mTc Sestamibi on SPECT/CT to differentiate benign renal oncocytic neoplasms from renal cell carcinoma. A total of 57 renal tumors were prospectively collected. Histopathological analysis and radiomics data extraction were performed. XGBoost classifiers were trained using the radiomics features alone and combined with the results from the visual evaluation of 99mTc Sestamibi SPECT/CT examination. The combined SPECT/radiomics model achieved higher accuracy (95%) with an area under the curve (AUC) of 98.3% (95% CI 93.7-100%) than the radiomics-only model (71.67%) with an AUC of 75% (95% CI 49.7-100%) and visual evaluation of 99mTc Sestamibi SPECT/CT alone (90.8%) with an AUC of 90.8% (95%CI 82.5-99.1%). The positive predictive values of SPECT/radiomics, radiomics-only, and 99mTc Sestamibi SPECT/CT-only models were 100%, 85.71%, and 85%, respectively, whereas the negative predictive values were 85.71%, 55.56%, and 94.6%, respectively. Feature importance analysis revealed that 99mTc Sestamibi uptake was the most influential attribute in the combined model. This study highlights the potential of combining radiomics analysis with 99mTc Sestamibi SPECT/CT to improve the preoperative characterization of benign renal oncocytic neoplasms. The proposed SPECT/radiomics classifier outperformed the visual evaluation of 99mTc Sestamibii SPECT/CT and the radiomics-only model, demonstrating that the integration of 99mTc Sestamibi SPECT/CT and radiomics data provides improved diagnostic performance, with minimal false positive and false negative results.","Michail E.

Methods A total of 236 subjects were enrolled and divided into training and test sets for model construction. Firstly, a multi-view radiomics modeling strategy was designed in which different combinations of radiomics feature categories (original, LoG, and wavelet) were compared to obtain the optimal input feature sets. Minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance (mRMR) selection and least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) were used for feature reduction, and the next logistic regression method was used for model construction. Then, a Swin Transformer architecture was designed and trained using transfer learning techniques to construct the deep learning models (DL). Finally, the constructed multi-view radiomics and DL models were combined and compared for model selection and nomogram construction. The prediction accuracy, consistency, and clinical benefit were comprehensively evaluated in the model comparison. Results The optimal input feature set was found when LoG and wavelet features were combined, while 22 and 17 radiomic features in this set were selected to construct the ADC and T2 multi-view radiomic models, respectively. ADC and T2 DL models were built by transferring learning from a large number of natural images to a relatively small sample of prostate images. All individual and combined models showed good predictive accuracy, consistency, and clinical benefit. Compared with using only an ADC-based model, adding a T2-based model to the combined model would reduce the model’s predictive performance. The ADCCombinedScore model showed the best predictive performance among all and was transformed into a nomogram for better use in clinics. Discussion The constructed models in our study can be used as a predictor in differentiating PCa and BPH, thus helping clinicians make better clinical treatment decisions and reducing unnecessary prostate biopsies.","Chunyu Li,Ming Deng,Xin Zhong,Jin Ren,Xiaohui Chen,Jun Chen,Feng Xiao,Haibo Xu",,2023.0

For prompt diagnosis and AD reversal, precise prediction in the early and late phases of MCI is essential. This research investigates multimodal framework-based multitask learning in the following situations: (1) Differentiating early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI) from late MCI and (2) predicting when an MCI patient would acquire AD. Clinical data and two radiomics features on three brain areas deduced from magnetic resonance imaging were investigated (MRI). We proposed an attention-based module, Stack Polynomial Attention Network (SPAN), to firmly encode clinical and radiomics data input characteristics for successful representation from a small dataset. To improve multimodal data learning, we computed a potent factor using adaptive exponential decay (AED). We used experiments from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort study, which included 249 eMCI and 427 lMCI participants at baseline visits. The proposed multimodal strategy yielded the best c-index score in time prediction of MCI to AD conversion (0.85) and the best accuracy in MCI-stage categorization ([Formula: see text]).

Materials and Methods We conducted a retrospective study of two pLGG datasets with linked genomic and diagnostic T2-weighted MRI of patients: BCH (development dataset, n=214 [60 (28%) BRAF fusion, 50 (23%) BRAF V600E, 104 (49%) wild-type), and Child Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) (external validation, n=112 [60 (53%) BRAF-Fusion, 17 (15%) BRAF-V600E, 35 (32%) wild-type]). We developed a deep learning pipeline to classify BRAF mutational status (V600E vs. fusion vs. wild-type) via a two-stage process: 1) 3D tumor segmentation and extraction of axial tumor images, and 2) slice-wise, deep learning-based classification of mutational status. We investigated knowledge-transfer and self-supervised approaches to prevent model overfitting with a primary endpoint of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). To enhance model interpretability, we developed a novel metric, COMDist, that quantifies the accuracy of model attention around the tumor. Results A combination of transfer learning from a pretrained medical imaging-specific network and self-supervised label cross-training (TransferX) coupled with consensus logic yielded the highest macro-average AUC (0.82 [95% CI: 0.70-0.90]) and accuracy (77%) on internal validation, with an AUC improvement of +17.7% and a COMDist improvement of +6.4% versus training from scratch. On external validation, the TransferX model yielded AUC (0.73 [95% CI 0.68-0.88]) and accuracy (75%).

Delta-radiomics of the optic chiasm were calculated based on features extracted from preoperative and postoperative coronal T2-weighted images, followed by machine learning modeling using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator wrapped with support vector machine through fivefold cross-validation in the development set. The delta-radiomic model was independently evaluated in the test set, and compared with the combined model that incorporated delta-radiomics, significant clinical and morphological parameters. Results Postoperative morphological changes of the optic chiasm could not significantly be used as predictors for the visual outcome. In contrast, the delta-radiomics model represented good performances in predicting visual recovery, with an AUC of 0.821 in the development set and 0.811 in the independent test set. Moreover, the combined model that incorporated age and delta-radiomics features of the optic chiasm achieved the highest AUC of 0.841 and 0.840 in the development set and independent test set, respectively. Conclusions Our proposed machine learning models based on delta-radiomics of the optic chiasm can be used to predict postoperative visual recovery of pituitary adenoma patients. Clinical relevance statement Our delta-radiomics-based models from MRI enable accurate visual recovery predictions in pituitary adenoma patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery, facilitating better clinical decision-making and ultimately improving patient outcomes. Key Points • Prediction of the postoperative visual outcome for pituitary adenoma patients is important but challenging. • Delta-radiomics of the optic chiasm after surgical decompression represented better prognostic performances compared with its morphological changes. • The proposed machine learning models can serve as novel approaches to predict visual recovery for pituitary adenoma patients in clinical practice.","Zhou Yang,Jing Zheng,Zhouyang Huang,Yuen Teng,Chaoyue Chen,Jianguo Xu",,2023.0
10.21203/rs.3.rs-3098662/v1,,,Prediction of lymph node metastasis in patients with papillary thyroid cancer based on radiomics analysis and intraoperative frozen section: a retrospective study,"Abstract Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic efficiency among clinical model, radiomics model and nomogram that combined radiomics features and frozen section (FS) analysis for the prediction of lymph node (LN) metastasis for the patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Methods A total of 208 patients with PTC were retrospectively enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups randomly for training groups and validation groups. The Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were used for the selection of radiomics feature extracted from ultrasound (US) images. Univariate and multivariate logistic analysis were used to select predictors including clinical characteristics and FS associated with the status of LN. The clinical model, radiomics model and nomogram were subsequently established. Results Multivariate analysis indicated that age, size group, Adler grade, ACR score and the psammoma body group were independent predictors to predict lymph node metastasis (LNM). The results showed that in the training group, nomogram had better performance than clinical model ( P &gt; 0.05) and radiomics model ( P &lt; 0.05). In the validation group, the results were similar to the training group, nomogram had a little higher diagnostic efficiency than clinical model ( P &gt; 0.05) and radiomic model ( P &gt; 0.05). Both in the training and validation group, nomogram had minor non-significant improvements in AUC compared to clinical model and significant improvements compared to radiomic model, however, the sensitivity of nomogram was a little higher. Conclusion We proposed that the nomogram combined the radiomics features and FS had the promise to create a substantial biomarker for predicting LNM of patients with PTC.","Xin Lv,Jingjing Lü,Yang Hou,Santai Song,Yan-Jun Hu,Yan Yan,Tao Yu,Dongman Ye",,2023.0

10.1002/mp.16597,37517073.0,,Predictive value of radiomics analysis of enhanced CT for three‐tiered microvascular invasion grading in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Microvascular invasion (MVI) is a major risk factor, for recurrence and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radical surgery and liver transplantation. However, its diagnosis depends on the pathological examination of the resected specimen after surgery; therefore, predicting MVI before surgery is necessary to provide reference value for clinical treatment. Meanwhile, predicting only the existence of MVI is not enough, as it ignores the degree, quantity, and distribution of MVI and may lead to MVI-positive patients suffering due to inappropriate treatment. Although some studies have involved M2 (high risk of MVI), majority have adopted the binary classification method or have not included radiomics.To develop three-class classification models for predicting the grade of MVI of HCC by combining enhanced computed tomography radiomics features with clinical risk factors.The data of 166 patients with HCC confirmed by surgery and pathology were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were divided into the training (116 cases) and test (50 cases) groups at a ratio of 7:3. Of them, 69 cases were MVI positive in the training group, including 45 cases in the low-risk group (M1) and 24 cases in the high-risk group (M2), and 47 cases were MVI negative (M0). In the training group, the optimal subset features were obtained through feature selection, and the arterial phase radiomics model, portal venous phase radiomics model, delayed phase radiomics model, three-phase radiomics model, clinical imaging model, and combined model were developed using Linear Support Vector Classification. The test group was used for validation, and the efficacy of each model was evaluated through the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC).The clinical imaging features of MVI included alpha-fetoprotein, tumor size, tumor margin, peritumoral enhancement, intratumoral artery, and low-density halo. The area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC values of the clinical imaging model for M0, M1, and M2 were 0.831, 0.701, and 0.847, respectively, in the training group and 0.782, 0.534, and 0.785, respectively, in the test group. After combined radiomics analyis, the AUC values for M0, M1, and M2 in the test group were 0.818, 0.688, and 0.867, respectively. The difference between the clinical imaging model and the combined model was statistically significant (p = 0.029).The clinical imaging model and radiomics model developed in this study had a specific predictive value for HCC MVI grading, which can provide precise reference value for preoperative clinical diagnosis and treatment. The combined application of the two models had a high predictive efficacy.","Xin Zheng,Y. P. Xu,Jingcheng Huang,Shaoxi Cai,Wanwan Wang",,2023.0
10.1002/cai2.85,,,Progress in research on ultrasound radiomics for predicting the prognosis of breast cancer,"Abstract Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor and the leading cause of cancer‐related deaths in women worldwide. Effective means of predicting the prognosis of breast cancer are very helpful in guiding treatment and improving patients' survival. Features extracted by radiomics reflect the genetic and molecular characteristics of a tumor and are related to its biological behavior and the patient's prognosis. Thus, radiomics provides a new approach to noninvasive assessment of breast cancer prognosis. Ultrasound is one of the commonest clinical means of examining breast cancer. In recent years, some results of research into ultrasound radiomics for diagnosing breast cancer, predicting lymph node status, treatment response, recurrence and survival times, and other aspects, have been published. In this article, we review the current research status and technical challenges of ultrasound radiomics for predicting breast cancer prognosis.

10.4329/wjr.v15.i7.216,37545645.0,,Progress of magnetic resonance imaging radiomics in preoperative lymph node diagnosis of esophageal cancer,"Esophageal cancer, also referred to as esophagus cancer, is a prevalent disease in the cardiothoracic field and is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in China. Accurately determining the status of lymph nodes is crucial for developing treatment plans, defining the scope of intraoperative lymph node dissection, and ascertaining the prognosis of patients with esophageal cancer. Recent advances in diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the effectiveness of MRI for assessing lymph node involvement, making it a beneficial tool for guiding personalized treatment plans for patients with esophageal cancer in a clinical setting. Radiomics is a recently developed imaging technique that transforms radiological image data from regions of interest into high-dimensional feature data that can be analyzed. The features, such as shape, texture, and waveform, are associated with the cancer phenotype and tumor microenvironment. When these features correlate with the clinical disease outcomes, they form the basis for specific and reliable clinical evidence. This study aimed to review the potential clinical applications of MRI-based radiomics in studying the lymph nodes affected by esophageal cancer. The combination of MRI and radiomics is a powerful tool for diagnosing and treating esophageal cancer, enabling a more personalized and effectual approach.","Yong Xu,Peng Lu,M.

Methods Two hundred twenty-eight patients with NF-PNETs undergoing MRI at 5 centers were retrospectively analyzed. Data from center 1 ( n = 115) constituted the training cohort, and data from centers 2–5 ( n = 113) constituted the testing cohort. Radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted images and the apparent diffusion coefficient. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was applied to select the most important features and to develop radiomics signatures. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was performed to assess models. Results Tumor boundary, enhancement homogeneity, and vascular invasion were used to construct the radiological model to stratify NF-PNET patients into grade 1 and 2/3 groups, which yielded AUC of 0.884 and 0.684 in the training and testing groups. A radiomics model including 4 features was constructed, with an AUC of 0.941 and 0.871 in the training and testing cohorts. The fusion model combining the radiomics signature and radiological characteristics showed good performance in the training set (AUC = 0.956) and in the testing set (AUC = 0.864), respectively. Conclusion The developed model that integrates radiomics features with radiological characteristics could be used as a non-invasive, dependable, and accurate tool for the preoperative prediction of grade in NF-PNETs. Clinical relevance statement Our study revealed that the fusion model based on a non-contrast MR sequence can be used to predict the histologic grade before operation. The radiomics model may be a new and effective biological marker in NF-PNETs. Key Points The diagnostic performance of the radiomics model and fusion model was better than that of the model based on clinical information and radiological features in predicting grade 1 and 2/3 of nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NF-PNETs). Good performance of the model in the four external testing cohorts indicated that the radiomics model and fusion model for predicting the grades of NF-PNETs were robust and reliable, indicating the two models could be used in the clinical setting and facilitate the surgeons’ decision on risk stratification. The radiomics features were selected from non-contrast T2-weighted images (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequence, which means that the administration of contrast agent was not needed in grading the NF-PNETs.","Hai-Bin Zhu,Hai‐Tao Zhu,Jiang Liu,Pei Nie,Juan Hu,Wei Tang,Xiaoyan Zhang,Xiaoting Li,Qian Ye,Ying‐Shi Sun",,2023.0

One-third of PD patients develop LID within 1 to 6 years of levodopa treatment. This study aimed to construct models based on radiomics and machine learning to predict early LID in PD. Methods: We extracted radiomics features from the T1-weighted MRI obtained in the baseline of 49 PD control and 54 PD with LID in the first 6 years of levodopa therapy. Six brain regions related to the onset of PD were segmented as regions of interest (ROIs). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used for feature selection. Using the machine learning methods of support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and AdaBoost, we constructed radiomics models and hybrid models. The hybrid models combined the radiomics features and the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS III) total score. The five-fold cross-validation was performed and repeated 20 times to validate the stability of the classifiers. We used sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) for model validation. Results: We selected 33 out of 6138 radiomics features. In the testing set of the radiomics model, the AUC values of the SVM, RF, and AdaBoost classifiers were 0.905, 0.808, and 0.778, respectively, and the accuracies were 0.839, 0.742, and 0.710. The hybrid models had better prediction performance. In the testing set, the AUC values of SVM, RF, and AdaBoost classifiers were 0.958, 0.861, and 0.832, respectively, and the accuracies were 0.903, 0.806, and 0.774. Conclusions: Our results indicate that T1-weighted MRI is valuable in predicting early LID in PD. This work demonstrates that the combination of radiomics features and clinical features has good potential and value for identifying early LID in PD.","Yang Luo,Huiqin Chen,Mingzhen Gui",,2023.0

Radiomics has shown promise in brain tumor diagnosis and patient-prognosis prediction by providing more detailed and objective information about tumors’ features than can be obtained from the visual inspection of the images alone. Radiomics data can be analyzed to determine their correlation with a tumor’s genetic status and grade, as well as in the assessment of its recurrence vs. therapeutic response, among other features. In consideration of the multi-parametric and high-dimensional space of features extracted by radiomics, machine learning can further improve tumor diagnosis, treatment response, and patients’ prognoses. There is a growing recognition that tumors and their microenvironments (habitats) mutually influence each other—tumor cells can alter the microenvironment to increase their growth and survival. At the same time, habitats can also influence the behavior of tumor cells. In this systematic review, we investigate the current limitations and future developments in radiomics and machine learning in analysing brain tumors and their habitats.","Mehnaz Tabassum,Abdulla Al Suman,Eric Suero Molina,E.

Thirty-two immune compromised-RNU rats implanted with human U-251N cancer cells were imaged using DCE-MRI (7Tesla, Dual-Gradient-Echo). The aim was to perform pharmacokinetic analysis using a nested model (NM) selection technique to classify brain regions according to vasculature properties considered as the source of truth. A two-dimensional convolutional-based radiomics analysis was performed on the raw-DCE-MRI of the rat brains to generate dynamic radiomics maps. The raw-DCE-MRI and respective radiomics maps were used to build 28 unsupervised Kohonen self-organizing-maps (K-SOMs). A Silhouette-Coefficient (SC), k-fold Nested-Cross-Validation (k-fold-NCV), and feature engineering analyses were performed on the K-SOMs’ feature spaces to quantify the distinction power of radiomics features compared to raw-DCE-MRI for classification of different Nested Models. Results showed that eight radiomics features outperformed respective raw-DCE-MRI in prediction of the three nested models. The average percent difference in SCs between radiomics features and raw-DCE-MRI was: 29.875% ± 12.922%, p &lt; 0.001. This work establishes an important first step toward spatiotemporal characterization of brain regions using radiomics signatures, which is fundamental toward staging of tumors and evaluation of tumor response to different treatments.","Hassan Bagher‐Ebadian,Stephen L.

Materials and Methods: Imaging Biomarker Explorer (IBEX) expansion for the abbreviation IBEX extracted 51 radiomic features of 4 categories from 11 textures image regions of interest (ROI) of the phantom. 19 software pre-processing algorithms processed each CCR phantom ROI. All ROI texture processed image features were retrieved. Pre-processed CT image radiomic features were compared to non-processed features to measure its textural influence. Wilcoxon T-tests measured the pre-processing relevance of CT radiomic features on various textures. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was performed to cluster processer potency and texture impression likeness. Results: The pre-processing filter, CT texture Cartridge, and feature category affect the CCR phantom CT image’s radiomic properties. Pre-processing is statistically unaltered by Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM ) expansion for the abbreviation GLRLM and Neighborhood Intensity Difference matrix (NID) expansion for the abbreviation NID feature categories. The 30%, 40%, and 50% honeycomb are regular directional textures and smooth 3D-printed plaster resin, most of the image pre-processing feature alterations exhibited significant p-values in the histogram feature category. The Laplacian Filter, Log Filter, Resample, and Bit Depth Rescale Range pre-processing algorithms hugely influenced histogram and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) image features. Conclusion: We found that homogenous intensity phantom inserts, CT radiomic feature, are less sensitive to feature swaps during pre-processing than normal directed honeycomb and regular projected smooth 3D-printed plaster resin CT image textures. Because they lose fewer information during image enhancement, This feature concentration empowerment of the images also enhances texture pattern recognition.","Dharmendran Palani,K M Ganesh,Lavanya Karunagaran,Kesavan Govindaraj,Senthilkumar Shanmugam",,2023.0

This retrospective study included 93 patients who underwent MRI examinations of the head and neck region (78 patients presenting unique PGT, while 15 patients presented double PGT). A total of 108 PGT with histological confirmation were eligible for the radiomic analysis and were assigned to a training group (n = 83; 58 BPGT; 25 MPGT) and a testing group (n = 25; 16 BPGT; 9 MPGT). The radiomic features were extracted from 3D segmentations of the PGT on the T2-weighted and fat-saturated, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. Following feature reduction techniques, including LASSO regression analysis, a radiomic signature (RS) was built with five radiomic features. The RS presented a good diagnostic performance in differentiating between PGT, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.852 (p &lt; 0.001) in the training set and 0.786 (p = 0.017) in the testing set.

Regrettably, effective early identification tools are still lacking up to now. With the popularization and application of radiomics method in tumor management, some researchers try to introduce it into the early identification of PM in patients with GC. However, due to the complexity of radiomics, the value of radiomics method in the early identification of PM in GC patients remains controversial. Therefore, this systematic review was conducted to explore the feasibility of radiomics in the early identification of PM in GC patients. Methods PubMed, Cochrane, Embase and the Web of Science were comprehensively and systematically searched up to 25 July, 2022 (CRD42022350512). The quality of the included studies was assessed using the radiomics quality score (RQS). To discuss the superiority in diagnostic accuracy of radiomics-based machine learning, a subgroup analysis was performed by machine learning (ML) based on clinical features, radiomics features, and radiomics + clinical features. Results Finally, 11 eligible original studies covering 78 models were included in this systematic review. According to the meta-analysis, the radiomics + clinical features model had a c-index of 0.919 (95% CI: 0.871-0.969), pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 (0.83-0.94) and 0.87 (0.78-0.92), respectively, in the training set, and a c- index of 0.910 (95% CI: 0.886-0.934), pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.78 (0.71-0.84) and 0.83 (0.74-0.89), respectively, in the validation set. Conclusions The ML methods based on radiomics + clinical features had satisfactory accuracy for the early diagnosis of PM in GC patients, and can be used as an auxiliary diagnostic tool for clinicians. However, the lack of guidelines for the proper operation of radiomics has led to the diversification of radiomics methods, which seems to limit the development of radiomics. Even so, the clinical application value of radiomics cannot be ignored. The standardization of radiomics research is required in the future for the wider application of radiomics by developing intelligent tools of radiomics.

Methods: This retrospective study included 49 patients with laryngeal cancer who underwent 18 F-FDG-PET/CT before treatment, and these patients were divided into the training (n = 34) and testing (n = 15) cohorts.Seven clinical (age, sex, tumor size, T stage, N stage, Union for International Cancer Control stage, and treatment) and 40 18 F-FDG-PET–based radiomic features were used to predict disease progression and survival. Six ML algorithms (random forest, neural network, k-nearest neighbors, naïve Bayes, logistic regression, and support vector machine) were used for predicting disease progression. Two ML algorithms (cox proportional hazard and random survival forest [RSF] model) considering for time-to-event outcomes were used to assess progression-free survival (PFS), and prediction performance was assessed by the concordance index (C-index). Results: Tumor size, T stage, N stage, GLZLM_ZLNU, and GLCM_Entropy were the five most important features for predicting disease progression.In both cohorts, the naïve Bayes model constructed by these five features was the best performing classifier (training: AUC = 0.805; testing: AUC = 0.842).

This study aimed to develop and validate a radiomics model to predict benign and malignant VCFs on 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( 18 F-FDG-PET/CT). Results Twenty-six features (9 PET features and 17 CT features) and five clinical variables (age, SUVmax, SUVpeak, SULmax, SULpeak) were selected ultimately. The area under the curve (AUC) of the radiomics and clinical-radiomics model were statistically different from the clinical model in both training group (0.986, 0.987 vs. 0.884, p &lt; 0.05) and test group (0.962, 0.948 vs. 0.858, p &lt; 0.05), while there was no significant difference between the radiomics model and clinical-radiomics model ( p &gt; 0.05). The accuracy of the radiomics and clinical-radiomics model was 94%, 95.0% in training group and 93.2%, 93.2% in test group. Three models all showed good calibration (Hosmer_Lemeshow_test, p &gt; 0.05). According to the decision curve analysis (DCA), the radiomics model and clinical-radiomics model showed higher overall net benefit than the clinical model. Conclusions The PET/CT-based radiomics and clinical-radiomics model showed good performance in distinguishing between malignant and benign VCFs. The radiomics method may be valuable for treatment decision-making.","Xun Wang,Dandan Zhou,Kun Yu,Nan Chen,Mingxing Gao,Gu-qing Zhang,Junli Ma,Ge Shuang",,2023.0

The radiomic features of the region of interest in the CT images were extracted, and the radiomics-scores were calculated by the linear weighting and coefficients of the radiomic features after dimensionality reduction. The clinical predictors were screened using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. The radiomics model, clinical model, and clinical-radiomics (C-R) model were constructed respectively. Their predictive performance for the efficacy of hip preservation was compared in the training and testing sets, with evaluation indexes including area under the curve, C-Index, sensitivity, specificity, and calibration curve, etc. The best model was visualised using nomogram, and its clinical utility was assessed by decision curves.At the 3-year postoperative follow-up, the cumulative survival rate of hip preservation was 70.33%. Continued exposure to risk factors postoperative and Japanese Investigation Committee (JIC) staging were clinical predictors of the efficacy of hip preservation, and 13 radiomic features derived from least absolute shrinkage and selection operator downscaling were used to calculate Rad-scores. The C-R model outperformed both the clinical and radiomics models in predicting the efficacy of hip preservation 1, 2, 3 years postoperative in both the training and testing sets ( P<0.05), with good agreement between the predicted and observed values. A nomogram constructed based on the C-R model showed that patients with lower Rad-scores, no further postoperative exposure to risk factors, and B or C1 types of JIC staging had a higher probability of femoral survival at 1, 2, 3 years postoperatively. The decision curve analysis showed that the C-R model had a higher total net benefit than both the clinical and radiomics models with a single predictor, and it could bring more net benefit to patients within a larger probability threshold.The prediction model and nomogram constructed by CT-based radiomics combined with clinical data is a visual, quantifiable, and effective method for decision-making of hip preservation, which can predict the efficacy of NVBG before surgery and has a high value of clinical application.探讨CT影像组学和临床资料在预测非血管化植骨（non-vascularized bone grafting，NVBG）保髋疗效中的价值，构建一种可视量化、有效的保髋决策方法。.纳入2009年6月—2019年6月接受NVBG进行保髋的153例（182髋）股骨头坏死（osteonecrosis of the femoral head，ONFH）患者，以7∶3比例划分训练集（130髋）和测试集（52髋），根据术后3年时的随访结果定义保髋成败。提取CT影像中感兴趣区的影像组学特征，根据降维后的影像组学特征及其系数的线性加权获得影像组学评分，采用单因素、多因素Cox回归分析筛选临床预测因子，分别构建影像组学模型、临床模型和综合模型。在训练集及测试集中比较3种模型对保髋疗效的预测性能，评价指标包括曲线下面积、C-Index、敏感度、特异度和校准曲线等，采用列线图对最佳模型可视量化并通过决策曲线评估其临床效用。.术后3年随访时，保髋累积生存率达70.33%。术后是否继续接触致病因素和日本骨坏死研究会（JIC）分型是影响保髋疗效的临床预测因子，最小绝对收缩和选择算子降维所得的13个影像组学特征被用于构建Rad-scores。在训练集和测试集中，综合模型预测术后1、2、3年保髋疗效的性能均优于临床模型和影像组学模型（ P<0.05），预测值和实际观察值间具有良好一致性。基于综合模型所构建的列线图显示，较低的Rad-scores、术后不再接触致病因素和JIC分型中B型及C1型患者，术后1、2、3年股骨头生存概率较高。决策曲线分析结果表明，综合模型的总净收益均高于单一预测因子的临床模型和影像组学模型，可在较大概率阈值范围内带给患者更多净获益。.CT影像组学联合临床资料所构建的预测模型和列线图，是一种可视量化、有效的保髋决策方法，能在术前预测NVBG的保髋疗效，具备较高的临床应用价值。.","Xin Liu,Hao Chen,Peng Xue,Hongzhong Xi,Shuai He,Guoxin Sun,Bin Du",,2023.0
10.1016/j.softx.2023.101453,,,“shortCardiac” — An open-source framework for fast and standardized assessment of cardiac function,"In medicine, especially in radiology, artificial intelligence has sparked a growing interest in automated systems, image analysis, and acquisition standardization. In the wake of this standardization, the research field of “radiomics” has gained importance. Using computer-aided analysis, image data and contours can be evaluated to determine numerical values for shape, size, and gray-scale texture, which can then be examined in a clinical context. Especially in cardiovascular imaging, data acquisition and analysis in different cardiac and respiratory phases are of great interest. However, most research studies use parameters that have been laboriously calculated by hand. “ShortCardiac” is a Python-based framework with a user-friendly GUI for the quantitative determination of cardiac MR parameters. This allows researchers to utilize quantitative MR research for their studies without programming knowledge, with just a few clicks. All calculated parameters can be displayed graphically. “shortCardiac” allows the visualization of segmentation contours, the angle-dependent length measurement, the center of gravity and much more, in addition, the background can be hidden, and the images can be cropped automatically. In addition, “shortCardiac” can also be called via python and due to the object-oriented design, it is possible to integrate new segmentation frameworks with little effort in the future as well as to determine additional parameters. However, “ShortCardiac” comes with certain limitations. It only assesses cardiac short-axis data and functions merely as a post-processing framework for determining surrogate parameters based on segmentation and image information. Manual segmentations or usage of fully automated segmentations, such as Circle cvi42, require additional software tools. Regardless of these restrictions, “ShortCardiac” provides an efficient, user-friendly tool, enabling researchers to capitalize on the expanding domain of radiomics.","Karl Ludger Radke,Janina Hußmann,Lena Maria Röwer,Dirk Voit,Jens Frahm,Gerald Antoch,Dirk Klee,Frank Pillekamp,Hans‐Jörg Wittsack",,2023.0

Although several risk factors have been identified, there remains a lack of efficient instruments to accurately predict the incidence of POF in ANP.Retrospectively, the clinical and imaging data of 178 patients with ANP were collected from our database, and the patients were divided into training (n = 125) and validation (n = 53) cohorts. Through computed tomography image acquisition, the volume of interest segmentation, and feature extraction and selection, a pure radiomics model in terms of POF prediction was established. Then, a clinic-radiomics model integrating the pure radiomics model and clinical risk factors was constructed. Both primary and secondary endpoints were compared between the high- and low-risk groups stratified by the clinic-radiomics model.According to the 547 selected radiomics features, four models were derived from features. A clinic-radiomics model in the training and validation sets showed better predictive performance than pure radiomics and clinical models. The clinic-radiomics model was evaluated by the ratios of intervention and mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stays, and hospital stays. The results showed that the high-risk group had significantly higher intervention rates, ICU stays, and hospital stays than the low-risk group, with the confidence interval of 90% (p < 0.1 for all).This clinic-radiomics model is a useful instrument for clinicians to evaluate the incidence of POF, facilitating patients' and their families' understanding of the ANP prognosis.","Nan Liu,Yidong Wan,Yifan Tong,Jie He,Shufeng Xu,Xi Hu,Chen Luo,Lei Xu,Feng Guo,Bo Shen,Haiyan Yu",,2023.0

This study aimed to develop a radiomics-based model that utilizes preoperative brain MRI for multiclass classification of BCBM subtypes and to investigate whether the model offers better prediction accuracy than the assumption that primary lesions and their BCBMs would be of the same subtype (non-conversion model) in an external validation set.The training and external validation sets each comprised 51 cases (102 cases total). Four machine learning classifiers combined with three feature selection methods were trained on radiomic features and primary lesion subtypes for prediction of the following four subtypes: 1) hormone receptor (HR)+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-, 2) HR+/HER2+, 3) HR-/HER2+, and 4) triple-negative. After training, the performance of the radiomics-based model was compared to that of the non-conversion model in an external validation set using accuracy and F1-macro scores.The rate of discrepant subtypes between primary lesions and their respective BCBMs were 25.5% (n=13 of 51) in the training set and 23.5% (n=12 of 51) in the external validation set. In the external validation set, the accuracy and F1-macro score of the radiomics-based model were significantly higher than those of the non-conversion model (0.902 vs. 0.765, p=0.004; 0.861 vs. 0.699, p=0.002).Our radiomics-based model represents an incremental advance in the classification of BCBM subtypes, thereby facilitating a more appropriate personalized therapy.","Seonghyeon Cho,Bio Joo,Mina Park,Sung Jun Ahn,Sang Hyun Suh,Yae Won Park,Sung Soo Ahn,Seung Koo Lee",,2023.0
10.1016/j.rcro.2023.100004,,,A comprehensive evaluation of MR-radiomics role in NAR score prediction in locally advanced rectal cancer,"Neoadjuvant Rectal Score (NAR score) is a short-term endpoint developed for clinical trials involving rectal cancer. It can be used as an early evaluation of neoadjuvant treatment response. In this study, we aim to develop a machine learning model based on radiomics features extracted from T2w magnetic resonance images (MRI) obtained pre-operatively to predict for two different binary outcomes, NAR>16 and NAR<8. 112 unique patients who had undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NAC) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) in National Cancer Centre Singapore were enrolled in this study. Radiomics features were extracted from three different types of segments that were contoured on the T2w MRI before and after NAC. The segments comprised of gross tumor volume (GTV), clinical tumor volume (CTV) and CTV + GTV (total). From which, five different clinico-radiomics models were constructed namely, 1) clinical + GTV, 2) clinical + CTV, 3) clinical + CTV + GTV, 4) clinical + total and 5) clinical + GTV + CTV + total models. The radiomics features extracted from the pre-MRI were also compared with the delta-radiomics approach in this study. This gives a total of ten clinico-radiomics model for each outcome. A nested 10-fold cross validation approach with the AUC metric were used to determine the optimal model. Calibration curves and feature importance were also calculated for the best performing clinico-radiomics models for each outcome and approach. The best NAR<8 pre-MRI and delta clinico-radiomics model models improve the AUC of the clinical model from 0.827 ± 0.206 to 0.868 ± 0.142 and 0.878 ± 0.111 respectively. Both increases are statistically significant (P = 0.032 and P = 0.022). The best NAR>16 pre-MRI and delta clinico-radiomics model models improve the AUC of the clinical model from 0.622 ± 0.146 to 0.749 ± 0.124 and 0.687 ± 0.150 respectively. Only the NAR>16 pre-MRI clinio-radiomics showed a statistically significant increase in AUC (P = 0.041). Out of the four models, only the two NAR>16 clinico-radiomics model are well calibrated. The results also show that the GTV and CTV features are the most important features for NAR<8 model, while the CTV + GTV features are the main driver of NAR>16 pre-MRI clinico-radiomics model. We have carried out for the first time a comprehensive evaluation of MR radiomics models by considering radiomics feature extracted from various segments, pre-MRI versus delta-radiomics and five machine learning algorithms. Our results show that MR radiomics models can value-add to clinical parameters in predicting the NAR score, and it is worthwhile to consider several permutations of the clinico-radiomics models to arrive at the best performing model.","Wen Chuan Chong,Wan Ying Chan,Sharon Shuxian Poh,T.R.

Our aim is to develop a delta radiomics (DRF) model from MRI-based brachytherapy treatment and assess its association with progression free survival (PFS).Materials and MethodsA retrospective analysis of FIGO stage IB- IV cervical cancer patients between 2012 and 2018 who were treated with definitive chemoradiation followed by MRI-based intracavitary brachytherapy was performed. Clinical factors together with 18 radiomic features extracted from different radiomics matrices were analyzed. The delta radiomic features (DRFs) were extracted from MRI on the first and last brachytherapy fractions. Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were fitted to combinations of 2–3 DRFs found significant after Spearman correlation and Wilcoxon rank sum test statistics. Additional models were tested that included clinical factors together with DRFs.ResultsA total of 39 patients were included in the analysis with a median patient age of 52 years. Progression occurred in 20% of patients (8/39). The significant DRFs using two DRF feature combinations was a model using auto correlation (AC) and sum variance (SV). The best performing three feature model combined mean, AC & SV. Additionally, the inclusion of FIGO stages with the 2- and 3 DRF combination model(s) improved performance compared to models with only DRFs. However, all the clinical factor + DRF models were not significantly different from one another (all AUCs were 0.77).ConclusionsOur study shows promising evidence that radiomics metrics are associated with progression free survival in cervical cancer.","Christina Small,Phillip Prior,Haidy Nasief,R.

Based on the history of NACT before surgery, all pathologies were divided into the NACT and surgery groups. The incidence rate of lymphatic metastasis in the two groups was determined based on the results of pathological examination following lymphadenectomy. Patients from the primary and secondary centers who received NACT were enrolled for radiomics analysis in the second half of the study. The patient cohorts from the primary center were randomly divided into training and test cohorts at a ratio of 7:3. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging after NACT. Segmentation was performed on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging, contrast-enhanced T1WI (CET1WI), and diffusion-weighted imaging.The rate of lymphatic metastasis in the NACT group (33.2%) was significantly lower than that in the surgery group (58.7%, P=0.007). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of Radscore_CET1WI for predicting lymph node metastasis and non-lymphatic metastasis were 0.800 and 0.797 in the training and test cohorts, respectively, exhibiting superior diagnostic performance. After combining the clinical variables, the tumor diameter on magnetic resonance imaging was incorporated into the Rad_clin model constructed using Radscore_CET1WI. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test of the Rad_clin model revealed no significant differences in the goodness of fit in the training (P=0.594) or test cohort (P=0.748).The Radscore provided by CET1WI may achieve a higher diagnostic performance in predicting lymph node metastasis.

Methods Patients with pNETs who underwent contrast-enhanced abdominal CT between 2010 and 2022 were included in this retrospective study. Radiomics features were extracted, and five radiomics-based ML models, namely logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), XGBoost, and GaussianNB, were developed. The performance of these models was evaluated using a time-independent testing set, and metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. The accuracy of the radiomics model was compared to that of needle biopsy. The Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) tool and the correlation between radiomics and biological features were employed to explore the interpretability of the model. Results A total of 122 patients (mean age: 50 ± 14 years; 53 male) were included in the training set, whereas 100 patients (mean age: 48 ± 13 years; 50 male) were included in the testing set. The AUCs for LR, SVM, RF, XGBoost, and GaussianNB were 0.758, 0.742, 0.779, 0.744, and 0.745, respectively, with corresponding accuracies of 73.0%, 70.0%, 77.0%, 71.9%, and 72.9%. The SHAP tool identified two features of the venous phase as the most significant, which showed significant differences among the Ki-67 index or mitotic count subgroups ( p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions An interpretable radiomics-based RF model can effectively differentiate between G1 and G2/3 of pNETs, demonstrating favorable interpretability. Clinical relevance statement The radiomics-based interpretable model developed in this study has significant clinical relevance as it offers a non-invasive method for assessing the pathological grade of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and holds promise as an important complementary tool to traditional tissue biopsy. Key Points • A radiomics-based interpretable model was developed to predict the pathological grade of pNETs and compared with preoperative needle biopsy in terms of accuracy. • The model, based on CT radiomics, demonstrated favorable interpretability. • The radiomics model holds potential as a valuable complementary technique to preoperative needle biopsy; however, it should not be considered a replacement for biopsy.","Jing-Yuan Ye,Fang Peng,Zhenpeng Peng,Xiaocheng Huang,Jinzhao Xie,Xiao‐Yu Yin",,2023.0

Detecting and treating bone metastasis at an early stage is crucial to improve the quality of life and survival of prostate cancer patients. This objective strongly relies on imaging studies. While CT and MRI have their specific utilities, they also possess certain drawbacks. Bone scintigraphy, although cost-effective and widely available, presents high false-positive rates. The emergence of PET/CT and PET/MRI, with their ability to overcome the limitations of standard imaging methods, offers promising alternatives for the detection of bone metastasis. Various radiotracers targeting cell division activity or cancer-specific membrane proteins, as well as bone seeking agents, have been developed and tested. The use of positron-emitting isotopes such as fluorine-18 and gallium-68 for labeling allows for a reduced radiation dose and unaffected biological properties. Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics techniques in medical imaging has shown significant advancements in reducing interobserver variability, improving accuracy, and saving time.

Radiomic features were extracted from preoperative CT images, and targeted genomic data were profiled through next-generation sequencing. PD-L1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry staining (chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for categorical data and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous data). A total of 1,013 radiomic features were obtained from each patient's CT images. Consensus clustering was used to cluster patients on the basis of radiomic features.The 288 patients were classified according to consensus clustering into four radiomic phenotypes: Cluster 1 (n = 11) involving mainly large solid masses with a maximum diameter of 5.1 ± 2.0 cm; Clusters 2 and 3 involving mainly part-solid and solid masses with maximum diameters of 2.1 ± 1.4 cm and 2.1 ± 0.9 cm, respectively; and Cluster 4 involving mostly small ground-glass opacity lesions with a maximum diameter of 1.0 ± 0.9 cm.

The traditional CTA model was built by the traditional radiological features of carotid plaques measured on CTA images which were screened by univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression. We extracted and screened radiomics features from carotid plaques and PVAT. Then, a support vector machine was used for building plaque and PVAT radiomics models, as well as a combined model using traditional CTA features and radiomics features. The diagnostic value between radiomics models and traditional CTA model was compared in identifying symptomatic carotid plaques by Delong method.The area under curve (AUC) values of traditional CTA model were 0.624 and 0.624 for the training and validation groups, respectively. The plaque radiomics model and PVAT radiomics model achieved AUC values of 0.766, 0.740 and 0.759, 0.618 in the two groups, respectively.

The distance correlation (DC) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were used to select the radiomics signatures. Three machine learning algorithms including neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to construct radiomics models. In addition, a nomogram was developed by combining the optimal radiomics signature with clinical risk factors, and the potential clinical utility of the nomogram was evaluated using decision curve analysis.The LDA+DC model was identified as the optimal classifier among the six radiomics models. Necrosis was determined as a risk factor for +7/-10 in IDH-wt histologically LGG. The nomogram achieved the best performance, with an AUC of 0.854 and an accuracy of 0.778 in the independent test group. The decision curve of the nomogram confirmed its clinical usefulness in a wide range of thresholds.The nomogram combining radiomics and semantic features can predict the +7/-10 status effectively, which may contribute to the risk stratification and individualized treatment planning of patients with IDH-wt histologically LGG.","Xiaoni Kong,Miao Yu,Fengjun Xi,Yan Li,Yuqi Luo,Jun Ma",,2023.0
10.1002/mp.16683,37690455.0,,Diagnosis of cognitive and motor disorders levels in stroke patients through explainable machine learning based on MRI,"Abstract Background Globally, stroke is the third most significant cause of disability. A stroke may produce motor, sensory, perceptual, or cognitive disorders that result in disability and affect the likelihood of recovery, affecting a person's ability to function. Evaluation post‐stroke is critical for optimal stroke care. Purpose Traditional methods for classifying the clinical disorders of cognitive and motor in stroke patients use assessment and interrogative measures, which are time‐consuming, complex, and labor‐intensive. In response to the current situation, this study develops an algorithm to automatically classify motor and cognitive disorders in stroke patients by 3D brain MRI to assist physicians in diagnosis. Methods First, radiomics and fusion features are extracted from the OAx T2 Propeller of 3D brain MRI. Then, we use 14 machine learning models and one model ensemble method to predict Fugl‐Meyer and MMSE levels of stroke patients. Next, we evaluate the models using accuracy, recall, f1‐score, and area under the curve (AUC). Finally, we employ SHAP to explain the output of the model. Results The best predictive models come from Random Forest (RF) Classifier with fusion features in cognitive classification and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with radiomics features in motor classification. The highest accuracies are 92.0 and 82.5% for cognitive and motor disorders. Conclusions MRI brain maps can classify the cognitive and motor disorders of stroke patients. Radiomics features demonstrate its merits. The proposed algorithms with MRI images can efficiently assist physicians in diagnosing the cognitive and motor disorders of stroke patients in clinical practice. Additionally, this lessens labor costs, improves diagnostic effectiveness, and avoids the subjective difference that comes with manual assessment.","Meng Wang,Yandan Lin,Feifei Gu,Wenyu Xing,Boyi Li,Xue Jiang,Chengcheng Liu,Dan Li,Ying Liu,Yi Wu,Dean Ta",,2023.0
10.21203/rs.3.rs-3304181/v1,,,Differentiation between cerebral alveolar echinococcosis and brain metastases with radiomics combined machine learning approach,"Abstract Background Cerebral alveolar echinococcosis (CAE) and brain metastases (BM) are similar in locations and imaging appearance. While, CAE is usually treated with chemotherapy and surgical treatment, BM is often treated with radiotherapy and targeted primary malignancy treatment. Accurate diagnosis is critical due to the vastly different treatment approaches for these conditions. Purpose This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of radiomics and machine learning approaches on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in distinguishing CAE and BM. Methods We have retrospectively analyzed MRI images of 130 patients (30 CAE, 100 BM, training set = 91, testing set = 39) who confirmed CAE or BM in Xinjiang medical university's first affiliated hospital from January 2014 to December 2022. Three dimensional tumors were segmented by radiologists from contrast-enhanced T1WI images on open resources software 3D Slicer. Features were extracted on Pyradiomics, further feature reduction was carried out using univariate analysis, correlation analysis, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Finally, we built five machine learning models, support vector machine, logistic regression, linear discrimination analysis, KNeighbors classifier, and Gaussian NB and evaluated their performance via several metrics including sensitivity (recall), specificity, positive predictive value (precision), negative predictive value, accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC). Results The area under curve (AUC) of SVC, LR, LDA, KNN, and NB algorithms in training (testing) sets are 0.99 (0.94), 1.00 (0.87), 0.98 (0.92), 0.97 (0.97), and 0.98 (0.93) respectively. Nested cross-validation demonstrated the robustness and generalizability of the models. Additionally, the calibration plot and decision curve analysis demonstrated the practical usefulness of these models in clinical practice, with lower bias toward different subgroups during decision-making. Conclusion The combination of radiomics and machine learning approach on contrast enhanced T1WI images could well distinguish CAE and BM.

10.37349/etat.2023.00153,37720353.0,,Emerging role of quantitative imaging (radiomics) and artificial intelligence in precision oncology,"Cancer is a fatal disease and the second most cause of death worldwide. Treatment of cancer is a complex process and requires a multi-modality-based approach. Cancer detection and treatment starts with screening/diagnosis and continues till the patient is alive. Screening/diagnosis of the disease is the beginning of cancer management and continued with the staging of the disease, planning and delivery of treatment, treatment monitoring, and ongoing monitoring and follow-up. Imaging plays an important role in all stages of cancer management. Conventional oncology practice considers that all patients are similar in a disease type, whereas biomarkers subgroup the patients in a disease type which leads to the development of precision oncology. The utilization of the radiomic process has facilitated the advancement of diverse imaging biomarkers that find application in precision oncology. The role of imaging biomarkers and artificial intelligence (AI) in oncology has been investigated by many researchers in the past. The existing literature is suggestive of the increasing role of imaging biomarkers and AI in oncology. However, the stability of radiomic features has also been questioned. The radiomic community has recognized that the instability of radiomic features poses a danger to the global generalization of radiomic-based prediction models. In order to establish radiomic-based imaging biomarkers in oncology, the robustness of radiomic features needs to be established on a priority basis. This is because radiomic models developed in one institution frequently perform poorly in other institutions, most likely due to radiomic feature instability. To generalize radiomic-based prediction models in oncology, a number of initiatives, including Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN), Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA), and Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative (IBSI), have been launched to stabilize the radiomic features.","Ashish Kumar Jha,Sneha Mithun,Umeshkumar B.

10.1007/s10278-023-00835-8,37735307.0,,External Validation of Robust Radiomic Signature to Predict 2-Year Overall Survival in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer,"Abstract Lung cancer is the second most fatal disease worldwide. In the last few years, radiomics is being explored to develop prediction models for various clinical endpoints in lung cancer. However, the robustness of radiomic features is under question and has been identified as one of the roadblocks in the implementation of a radiomic-based prediction model in the clinic. Many past studies have suggested identifying the robust radiomic feature to develop a prediction model. In our earlier study, we identified robust radiomic features for prediction model development. The objective of this study was to develop and validate the robust radiomic signatures for predicting 2-year overall survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This retrospective study included a cohort of 300 stage I–IV NSCLC patients. Institutional 200 patients’ data were included for training and internal validation and 100 patients’ data from The Cancer Image Archive (TCIA) open-source image repository for external validation. Radiomic features were extracted from the CT images of both cohorts. The feature selection was performed using hierarchical clustering, a Chi-squared test, and recursive feature elimination (RFE). In total, six prediction models were developed using random forest (RF-Model-O, RF-Model-B), gradient boosting (GB-Model-O, GB-Model-B), and support vector(SV-Model-O, SV-Model-B) classifiers to predict 2-year overall survival (OS) on original data as well as balanced data. Model validation was performed using 10-fold cross-validation, internal validation, and external validation. Using a multistep feature selection method, the overall top 10 features were chosen. On internal validation, the two random forest models (RF-Model-O, RF-Model-B) displayed the highest accuracy; their scores on the original and balanced datasets were 0.81 and 0.77 respectively. During external validation, both the random forest models’ accuracy was 0.68. In our study, robust radiomic features showed promising predictive performance to predict 2-year overall survival in NSCLC.","Ashish Kumar Jha,Umeshkumar B.

The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of predicting the nuclear grading of DCIS, by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics features. And to develop a nomogram combining radiomics features and MRI semantic features to explore the potential role of MRI radiomic features in the assessment of DCIS nuclear grading.A total of 156 patients (159 lesions) with DCIS and DCIS with microinvasive (DCIS-MI) were enrolled in this retrospective study, with 112 lesions included in the training cohort and 47 lesions included in the validation cohort. Radiomics features were extracted from Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) phases 1st and 5th. After feature selection, radiomics signature was constructed and radiomics score (Rad-score) was calculated. Multivariate analysis was used to identify MRI semantic features that were significantly associated with DCIS nuclear grading and combined with Rad-score to construct a Nomogram. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the predictive performance of Rad-score and Nomogram, and decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical utility.In multivariate analyses of MRI semantic features, larger tumor size and heterogeneous enhancement pattern were significantly associated with high-nuclear grade DCIS (HNG DCIS). In the training cohort, Nomogram had an area under curve (AUC) of 0.879 and Rad-score had an AUC of 0.828. Similarly, in the independent validation cohort, Nomogram had an AUC value of 0.828 and Rad-score had an AUC of 0.772. In both the training and validation cohorts, Nomogram had a significantly higher AUC value than Rad-score (P<0.05). DCA confirmed that Nomogram had a higher net clinical benefit.MRI-based radiomic features can be used as potential biomarkers for assessing nuclear grading of DCIS. The nomogram constructed by radiomic features combined with semantic features is feasible in discriminating non-HNG and HNG DCIS.","Mengran Zhao,Wenjuan Ma,Xiufeng Song,Zhijun Li,Zhongcai Shao,Hong Lü,Rui Zhao,Yijun Guo,Zhaoxiang Ye,Peifang Liu",,2023.0

Conventional radiomics rely on extraction of image features within a pre-defined image region of interest (ROI) which are typically fed to a classification algorithm for prediction of a clinical endpoint. Deep learning radiomics allows for a simpler workflow where images can be used directly as input to a convolutional neural network (CNN) with or without a pre-defined ROI.The purpose of this study was to evaluate (i) conventional radiomics and (ii) deep learning radiomics for predicting overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) using pre-treatment 18F-fluorodeoxuglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) and computed tomography (CT) images.FDG PET/CT images and clinical data of patients with HNSCC treated with radio(chemo)therapy at Oslo University Hospital (OUS; n = 139) and Maastricht University Medical Center (MAASTRO; n = 99) were collected retrospectively. OUS data was used for model training and initial evaluation. MAASTRO data was used for external testing to assess cross-institutional generalizability. Models trained on clinical and/or conventional radiomics features, with or without feature selection, were compared to CNNs trained on PET/CT images without or with the gross tumor volume (GTV) included. Model performance was measured using accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and the F1 score calculated for both classes separately.CNNs trained directly on images achieved the highest performance on external data for both endpoints. Adding both clinical and radiomics features to these image-based models increased performance further. Conventional radiomics including clinical data could achieve competitive performance. However, feature selection on clinical and radiomics data lead to overfitting and poor cross-institutional generalizability. CNNs without tumor and node contours achieved close to on-par performance with CNNs including contours.High performance and cross-institutional generalizability can be achieved by combining clinical data, radiomics features and medical images together with deep learning models. However, deep learning models trained on images without contours can achieve competitive performance and could see potential use as an initial screening tool for high-risk patients.","Bao Ngoc Huynh,Aurora Rosvoll Groendahl,Oliver Tomić,Kristian Hovde Liland,Ingerid Skjei Knudtsen,Frank Hoebers,Wouter van Elmpt,Eirik Malinen,Einar Dale,Cecilia Marie Futsæther",,2023.0

Our study aimed to evaluate the value of ultrasound radiomics based on intratumoral and peritumoral tissues in predicting Ki-67 expression levels in patients with HCC.We conducted a retrospective analysis of ultrasonic and clinical data from 118 patients diagnosed with HCC through histopathological examination of surgical specimens in our hospital between September 2019 and January 2023. Radiomics features were extracted from ultrasound images of both intratumoral and peritumoral regions. To select the optimal features, we utilized the t-test and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We compared the area under the curve (AUC) values to determine the most effective modeling method. Subsequently, we developed four models: the intratumoral model, the peritumoral model, combined model #1, and combined model #2.Of the 118 patients, 64 were confirmed to have high Ki-67 expression while 54 were confirmed to have low Ki-67 expression. The AUC of the intratumoral model was 0.796 (0.649-0.942), and the AUC of the peritumoral model was 0.772 (0.619-0.926). Furthermore, combined model#1 yielded an AUC of 0.870 (0.751-0.989), and the AUC of combined model#2 was 0.762 (0.605-0.918). Among these models, combined model#1 showed the best performance in terms of AUC, accuracy, F1-score, and decision curve analysis (DCA).We presented an ultrasound radiomics model that utilizes both intratumoral and peritumoral tissue information to accurately predict Ki-67 expression in HCC patients. We believe that incorporating both regions in a proper manner can enhance the diagnostic performance of the prediction model. Nevertheless, it is not sufficient to include both regions in the region of interest (ROI) without careful consideration.","Hongwei Qian,Zhihong Shen,Difan Zhou,Yanhua Huang",,2023.0

The BRAF-V600E gene mutation is a prevalent genetic alteration found in this tumor and is considered to have a crucial role in its pathogenesis. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a radiomics-based machine learning method for the identification of BRAF-V600E gene mutations in ameloblastoma patients.In this retrospective study, data from 103 patients diagnosed with ameloblastoma who underwent BRAF-V600E mutation testing were collected. Of these patients, 72 were included in the training cohort, while 31 were included in the validation cohort. To address class imbalance, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is applied in our study. Radiomics features were extracted from preprocessed CT images, and the most relevant features, including both radiomics and clinical data, were selected for analysis. Machine learning methods were utilized to construct models. The performance of these models in distinguishing between patients with and without BRAF-V600E gene mutations was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.When the analysis was based on radiomics signature, Random Forest performed better than the others, with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.87 (95%CI, 0.68-1.00). The performance of XGBoost model is slightly lower than that of Random Forest, and its AUC is 0.83 (95% CI, 0.60-1.00). The nomogram evident that among younger women, the affected region primarily lies within the mandible, and patients with larger tumor diameters exhibit a heightened risk. Additionally, patients with higher radiomics signature scores are more susceptible to the BRAF-V600E gene mutations.Our study presents a comprehensive radiomics-based machine learning model using five different methods to accurately detect BRAF-V600E gene mutations in patients diagnosed with ameloblastoma. The Random Forest model's high predictive performance, with AUC of 0.87, demonstrates its potential for facilitating a convenient and cost-effective way of identifying patients with the mutation without the need for invasive tumor sampling for molecular testing. This non-invasive approach has the potential to guide preoperative or postoperative drug treatment for affected individuals, thereby improving outcomes.","Wen Li,Yang Li,Xiaoling Liu,Li Wang,Wenqian Chen,Xueshen Qian,Xianglong Zheng,Jiang Chen,Yiming Liu,Lisong Lin",,2023.0

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of baseline computed tomography (CT) data for future remnant liver (FRL) hypertrophy after PVE. Methods In this retrospective study, all consecutive patients undergoing right-sided PVE with or without hepatic vein embolization between 2018 and 2021 were included. CT volumetry was performed before and after PVE to assess standardized FRL volume (sFRLV). Radiomic features were extracted from baseline CT after segmenting liver (without tumor), spleen and bone marrow. For selecting features that allow classification of response (hypertrophy ≥ 1.33), a stepwise dimension reduction was performed. Logistic regression models were fitted and selected features were tested for their predictive value. Decision curve analysis was performed on the test dataset. Results A total of 53 patients with liver tumor were included in this study. sFRLV increased significantly after PVE, with a mean hypertrophy of FRL of 1.5 ± 0.3-fold. sFRLV hypertrophy ≥ 1.33 was reached in 35 (66%) patients. Three independent radiomic features, i.e. liver-, spleen- and bone marrow-associated, differentiated well between responders and non-responders. A logistic regression model revealed the highest accuracy (area under the curve 0.875) for the prediction of response, with sensitivity of 1.0 and specificity of 0.5.

10.3389/fonc.2023.1167328,37692840.0,,Multi-phase-combined CECT radiomics models for Fuhrman grade prediction of clear cell renal cell carcinoma,"Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of multi-phase-combined contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) radiomics methods for noninvasive Fuhrman grade prediction of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Methods A total of 187 patients with four-phase CECT images were retrospectively enrolled and then were categorized into training cohort (n=126) and testing cohort (n=61). All patients were confirmed as ccRCC by histopathological reports. A total of 110 3D classical radiomics features were extracted from each phase of CECT for individual ccRCC lesion, and contrast-enhanced variation features were also calculated as derived radiomics features. These features were concatenated together, and redundant features were removed by Pearson correlation analysis. The discriminative features were selected by minimum redundancy maximum relevance method (mRMR) and then input into a C-support vector classifier to build multi-phase-combined CECT radiomics models. The prediction performance was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Results The multi-phase-combined CECT radiomics model showed the best prediction performance (AUC=0.777) than the single-phase CECT radiomics model (AUC=0.711) in the testing cohort ( p value=0.039). Conclusion The multi-phase-combined CECT radiomics model is a potential effective way to noninvasively predict Fuhrman grade of ccRCC. The concatenation of first-order features and texture features extracted from corticomedullary phase and nephrographic phase are discriminative feature representations.","Zhengxin Zhou,Xusheng Qian,Jisu Hu,Geng Chen,Yongsheng Zhang,Xiaoguang Dou,Tuanjie Che,Jianbing Zhu,Yakang Dai",,2023.0

Traditionally, similar radiation dose and fractionation schedules have been used based on tumor stage with variable outcomes indicating “one size does not fit all”. In the era of precision medicine, though we have achieved physical precision with technological advancements, we have yet to attain biologic precision. In the current review, we have highlighted the different aspects of precision oncology such as hypoxia targeting, radiomics and radiogenomics, radiobiologic targeting, and big data. The review also discusses various potential therapeutic targets and approaches in head and neck cancer management that might help to increase radiosensitization, which in turn increase survival, and quality of life. This can be incorporated into the armamentarium of radiation oncology in all the phases of radiation planning, from diagnosis to treatment to the prognosis and management of long-term side effects. Biologic precision can be applied in the clinic to provide individualized, personalized treatment in the future.","Monali Swain,Sarbani Ghosh‐Laskar,Rahul Patil,Ashwini Budrukkar,Jaiprakash Agarwal",,2023.0

Medical imaging, namely radiologic and histologic images, has immense analytical potential in neuro-oncology, and models utilizing integrated radiomic and pathomic data may yield a synergistic effect and provide a new modality for precision medicine. At the same time, the ability to harness multi-modal data is met with challenges in aggregating data across medical departments and institutions, as well as significant complexity in modeling the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity of pediatric brain tumors. In this paper, we review recent pathomic and integrated pathomic, radiomic, and genomic studies with clinical applications. We discuss current challenges limiting translational research on pediatric brain tumors and outline technical and analytical solutions. Overall, we propose that to empower the potential residing in radio-pathomics, systemic changes in cross-discipline data management and end-to-end software platforms to handle multi-modal data sets are needed, in addition to embracing modern AI-powered approaches. These changes can improve the performance of predictive models, and ultimately the ability to advance brain cancer treatments and patient outcomes through the development of such models.","Ariana Familiar,Aria Mahtabfar,Anahita Fathi Kazerooni,Mahsa Kiani,Arastoo Vossough,Angela N.

This study sought to establish a radiomics nomogram based on the optimal VOI of multi-sequence MRI for predicting MVI in ICC tumors. Methods 160 single ICC lesions with MRI scanning confirmed by postoperative pathology were randomly separated into training and validation cohorts (TC and VC). Multivariate analysis identified independent clinical and imaging MVI predictors. Radiomics features were obtained from images of 6 MRI sequences at 4 different VOIs. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm was performed to enable the derivation of robust and effective radiomics features. Then, the best three sequences and the optimal VOI were obtained through comparison. The MVI prediction nomogram combined the independent predictors and optimal radiomics features, and its performance was evaluated via the receiver operating characteristics, calibration, and decision curves. Results Tumor size and intrahepatic ductal dilatation are independent MVI predictors. Radiomics features extracted from the best three sequences (T1WI-D, T1WI, DWI) with VOI 10mm (including tumor and 10 mm peritumoral region) showed the best predictive performance, with AUC TC = 0.987 and AUC VC = 0.859. The MVI prediction nomogram obtained excellent prediction efficacy in both TC (AUC = 0.995, 95%CI 0.987–1.000) and VC (AUC = 0.867, 95%CI 0.798–0.921) and its clinical significance was further confirmed by the decision curves. Conclusion A nomogram combining tumor size, intrahepatic ductal dilatation, and the radiomics model of MRI multi-sequence fusion at VOI 10mm may be a predictor of preoperative MVI status in ICC patients.","Xiaohai Ma,Xiaoqin Qian,Qing Wang,Yunfei Zhang,Ruilong Zong,Jia Zhang,Baoxin Qian,Chun Yang,Xiwen Lu,Yuzhen Shi",,2023.0
10.3389/fendo.2023.1181058,37795355.0,,Radiomics optimizing the evaluation of endometrial receptivity for women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss,"The optimization of endometrial receptivity (ER) through individualized therapies has been shown to enhance the likelihood of successful gestation. However, current practice lacks comprehensive methods for evaluating the ER of patients with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Radiomics, an emerging AI-based technique that enables the extraction of mineable information from medical images, holds potential to offer a more objective and quantitative approach to ER assessment. This innovative tool may facilitate a deeper understanding of the endometrial environment and enable clinicians to optimize ER evaluation in RPL patients.This study aimed to identify ultrasound radiomics features associated with ER, with the purpose of predicting successful ongoing pregnancies in RPL patients, and to assess the predictive accuracy of these features against regular ER parameters.This retrospective, controlled study involved 262 patients with unexplained RPL and 273 controls with a history of uncomplicated full-term pregnancies. Radiomics features were extracted from ultrasound endometrial segmentation images to derive a radiomics score (rad-score) for each participant. Associations between rad-scores, baseline clinical variables, and sonographic data were evaluated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify potential indicators of RPL. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the rad-score and other identified indicators in discriminating RPL cases. Furthermore, the relationships between age and these identified indicators were assessed via Pearson correlation analysis.From the 1312 extracted radiomics features, five non-zero coefficient radiomics signatures were identified as significantly associated with RPL, forming the basis of the rad-score. Following multivariate logistic regression analysis, age, spiral artery pulsatility index (SA-PI), vascularisation index (VI), and rad-score emerged as independent correlates of RPL (all P<0.05). ROC curve analyses revealed the superior discriminative capability of the rad-score (AUC=0.882) over age (AUC=0.778), SA-PI (AUC=0.771), and VI (AUC=0.595). There were notable correlations between age and rad-score (r=0.275), VI (r=-0.224), and SA-PI (r=0.211), indicating age-related variations in RPL predictors.This study revealed a significant association between unexplained RPL and elevated endometrial rad-scores during the WOI. Furthermore, it demonstrated the potential of rad-scores as a promising predictive tool for successful ongoing pregnancies in RPL patients.","Wendi Huang,Yi Jin,Lulu Jiang,Mengjie Liang",,2023.0

Predicting PAS severity is critical to individualise care planning for the birth. We aim to explore whether radiomic analysis of T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can predict severe cases by distinguishing between histopathological subtypes antenatally. Methods This was a bi-centre retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study conducted between 2018 and 2022. Women who underwent MRI during pregnancy and had histological confirmation of PAS were included. Radiomic features were extracted from T2-weighted images. Univariate regression and multivariate analyses were performed to build predictive models to differentiate between non-invasive (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] grade 1 or 2) and invasive (FIGO grade 3) PAS using R software. Prediction performance was assessed based on several metrics including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) at receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results Forty-one women met the inclusion criteria. At univariate analysis, 0.64 sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.0−1.00), specificity 0.93 (0.38−1.0), 0.58 accuracy (0.37−0.78) and 0.77 AUC (0.56−.097) was achieved for predicting severe FIGO grade 3 PAS. Using a multivariate approach, a support vector machine model yielded 0.30 sensitivity (95% CI 0.18−1.0]), 0.74 specificity (0.38−1.00), 0.58 accuracy (0.40−0.82), and 0.53 AUC (0.40−0.85). Conclusion Our results demonstrate a predictive potential of this machine learning pipeline for classifying severe PAS cases. Relevance statement This study demonstrates the potential use of radiomics from MR images to identify severe cases of placenta accreta spectrum antenatally. Key points • Identifying severe cases of placenta accreta spectrum from imaging is challenging. • We present a methodological approach for radiomics-based prediction of placenta accreta. • We report certain radiomic features are able to predict severe PAS subtypes. • Identifying severe PAS subtypes ensures safe and individualised care planning for birth.

10.3389/fradi.2023.1240544,37693924.0,,Spatial assessments in texture analysis: what the radiologist needs to know,"To date, studies investigating radiomics-based predictive models have tended to err on the side of data-driven or exploratory analysis of many thousands of extracted features. In particular, spatial assessments of texture have proven to be especially adept at assessing for features of intratumoral heterogeneity in oncologic imaging, which likewise may correspond with tumor biology and behavior. These spatial assessments can be generally classified as spatial filters, which detect areas of rapid change within the grayscale in order to enhance edges and/or textures within an image, or neighborhood-based methods, which quantify gray-level differences of neighboring pixels/voxels within a set distance. Given the high dimensionality of radiomics datasets, data dimensionality reduction methods have been proposed in an attempt to optimize model performance in machine learning studies; however, it should be noted that these approaches should only be applied to training data in order to avoid information leakage and model overfitting. While area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic is perhaps the most commonly reported assessment of model performance, it is prone to overestimation when output classifications are unbalanced. In such cases, confusion matrices may be additionally reported, whereby diagnostic cut points for model predicted probability may hold more clinical significance to clinical colleagues with respect to related forms of diagnostic testing.","Bino Varghese,Brandon Fields,Darryl Hwang,Vinay Duddalwar,George R.

We evaluated the methodological quality of the studies using the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS). The Cochrane Collaboration's software (RevMan 5.4), Meta-DiSc (v. 1.4) and IBM SPSS (v. 26.0) were used for all statistical analyses.Eighteen studies met our inclusion criteria, and the average RQS was 10.17 (standard deviation [SD]: 3.54). None of these studies incorporated any of the following items: a phantom study on all scanners, cut-off analyses, prospective study, cost-effectiveness analysis, or open science and data. In the meta-analysis, it showed apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) played a better role to predict Ki-67 level than dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI in the radiomics, with the pooled area under the curve (AUC) of 0.969.Ki-67 index is a common tumor biomarker with high clinical value. Radiomics is an ever-growing quantitative data-mining method helping predict tumor biomarkers from medical images. However, the quality of the reviewed studies evaluated by the RQS was not so satisfactory and there are ample opportunities for improvement. Open science and data, external validation, phantom study, publicly open radiomics database and standardization in the radiomics practice are what researchers should pay more attention to in the future.The RQS tool considered the radiomics used to predict the Ki-67 level was of poor quality.

Methods This retrospective study included 168 patients with surgically proven PTC (non-ETE, n = 90; ETE, n = 78) who were divided into training (n = 117) and validation (n = 51) cohorts by a random stratified sampling strategy. The regions of interest (ROIs) were obtained manually from 3D US images. A larger number of radiomic features were automatically extracted. Finally, a nomogram was built, incorporating the radiomics scores and selected clinical predictors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to validate the capability of the nomogram on both the training and validation sets. The nomogram models were compared with conventional US models. The DeLong test was adopted to compare different ROC curves. Results The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the radiologist was 0.67 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.580–0.757] in the training cohort and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.467–0.746) in the validation cohort. Sixteen features from 3D US images were used to build the radiomics signature. The radiomics nomogram, which incorporated the radiomics signature, tumor location, and tumor size showed good calibration and discrimination in the training cohort (AUC, 0.810; 95% CI, 0.727–0.876) and the validation cohort (AUC, 0.798; 95% CI, 0.662–0.897).

This study proposed a clinical-radiomics nomogram based on multimodal ultrasound that enhances the diagnostic accuracy for solid hypoechoic breast lesions. Method This retrospective study analyzed ultrasound strain elastography (SE) and automated breast volume scanner images (ABVS) of 423 solid hypoechoic breast lesions from 423 female patients in our hospital between August 2019 and May 2022. They were assigned to the training (n=296) and validation (n=127) groups in a 7:3 ratio by generating random numbers. Radiomics features were extracted and screened from ABVS and SE images, followed by the calculation of the radiomics score (Radscore) based on these features. Subsequently, a nomogram was constructed through multivariate logistic regression to assess the malignancy risk in breast lesions by combining Radscore with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) scores and clinical risk factors associated with breast malignant lesions. The diagnostic performance, calibration performance, and clinical usefulness of the nomogram were assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve, the calibration curve, and the decision analysis curve, respectively. Results The diagnostic performance of the nomogram is significantly superior to that of both the clinical diagnostic model (BI-RADS model) and the multimodal radiomics model (SE+ABVS radiomics model) in training (AUC: 0.972 vs 0.930 vs 0.941) and validation group (AUC:0.964 vs 0.916 vs 0.933). In addition, the nomogram also exhibited a favorable goodness-of-fit and could lead to greater net benefits for patients.

Grade 2 or higher oxaliplatin-related thrombocytopenia may result in dose reduction, discontinuation or delay initiation of chemotherapy and may adversely affect the therapeutic efficacy and even overall survival of patients. Early recognition of patients at risk of developing grade 2 or higher thrombocytopenia is critical. However, to date there is no well-established method to early identify patients at high risk. The aims of this study were to develop and validate a contrast-enhanced CT-based whole-spleen radiomics signature for early prediction of grade 2 or higher thrombocytopenia in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and to explore the incremental value of combining the radiomics signature and conventional clinical factors for risk prediction.A total of 119 patients with gastrointestinal malignancies receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy from March 2017 to December 2020 were retrospectively included and randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 85) and a validation cohort (n = 34). Grade 2 or higher thrombocytopenia occurred in 26.1% of patients (22 and nine patients in the training and validation cohort, respectively) with a median time interval of 101 days from the start of chemotherapy. The whole-spleen radiomics features were extracted on the portal venous phase of the first follow-up CT images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was applied to select radiomics features and to build the radiomics signature for the prediction of grade 2 or higher thrombocytopenia. A clinical model that included clinical factors only and a clinical-radiomics model that incorporated clinical factors and radiomics signature were constructed. The performances of both models were evaluated and compared in the training, validation and the whole cohorts.The radiomics signature yielded favorable performance in predicting grade 2 or higher thrombocytopenia, with the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity being 0.865, 81.8% and 84.1% in the training cohort and 0.747, 77.8% and 80.0% in the validation cohort. The AUCs of the clinical-radiomics model in the training and validation cohorts reached 0.913 (95% CI [0.720-0.935]) and 0.867 (95% CI [0.727-1.000]), greater than the AUCs of the clinical model. Integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) index showed that incorporating radiomic signature into conventional clinical factors significantly improved the predictive accuracy by 17.0% (95% CI [4.9%-29.1%], p = 0.006) in the whole cohort.Contrast-enhanced CT-based whole-spleen radiomics signature might serve as an early predictor for grade 2 or higher thrombocytopenia during oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies and provide incremental value over conventional clinical factors.","Yuhong Dai,Yiqi Cheng,Ziling Zhou,Zhen Li,Yi Luo,Hong Qian",,2023.0

Materials and methods The medical records of 155 patients who underwent surgical treatment for pathologically confirmed ESCC were collected. Patients were randomly divided into a training group (n=109) and a validation group (n=46) in a 7:3 ratio. Tumor regions are accurately segmented in computed tomography images of enrolled patients. Radiomic features were then extracted from the segmented tumors. We selected the features by Max-relevance and min-redundancy (mRMR) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods. A radiomics signature was then built by logistic regression analysis. To improve predictive performance, a radiomics nomogram that incorporated the radiomics signature and independent clinical predictors was built. Model performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analyses (DCA). Results We selected the five most relevant radiomics features to construct the radiomics signature. The radiomics model had general discrimination ability with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.79 in the training set that was verified by an AUC of 0.76 in the validation set. The radiomics nomogram consisted of the radiomics signature, and N stage showed excellent predictive performance in the training and validation sets with AUCs of 0.85 and 0.83, respectively. Furthermore, calibration curves and the DCA analysis demonstrated good fit and clinical utility of the radiomics nomogram. Conclusion We successfully established and validated a prediction model that combined radiomics features and N stage, which can be used to predict four-year recurrence risk in patients with ESCC who undergo surgery.","Yahan Tong,Junyi Chen,Jingjing Sun,Ting Luo,Shaofeng Duan,Kai Li,Kefeng Zhou,Jian Zeng,Lu Fj",,2023.0
10.1016/j.jrras.2023.100677,,,A study on the detection of thyroid cancer in Hashimoto's thyroiditis using computed tomography imaging radiomics,"The main focus of this research is to investigate how effectively a radiomics model based on computed tomography (CT) imaging can discriminate between thyroid cancer and Hashimoto's thyroiditis in patients. The ultimate objective is to introduce fresh approaches and numerical benchmarks that enable precise identification of thyroid cancer even in the presence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. A grand total of 376 eligible cases were gathered between August 2016 and August 2022.The cases were separated into a group for training purposes and another group for testing purposes. Two radiologists outlined regions of interest in the images and extracted radiomic features. After screening the features, the most statistically significant ones were chosen to create a tumor discrimination model that operates automatically. The evaluation of the model's performance involved analyzing the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, as well as measuring accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. After an exhaustive analysis, a total of 1316 radiomic characteristics were initially extracted. Among them, 11 optimal radiomic features were further identified through the application of mRMR and LASSO techniques for rigorous selection. The area under the curve (AUC) for the training set was found to be 0.911 ± 0.036 [with a 95% confidence interval of (0.845, 0.942), and a p-value less than 0.001]. The corresponding accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were determined to be 0.897, 0.889, and 0.862, respectively. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the remarkable diagnostic accuracy of radiomics using CT imaging when differentiating thyroid cancer in the context of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The diagnostic performance of this approach surpasses that of both ultrasound and subjective evaluations conducted by radiologists, underscoring its substantial practical utility in distinguishing thyroid cancer alongside Hashimoto's thyroiditis.","Jing Huang,Shaohua Xu,Yuan-zhe Li,Yi Wang,Shu-Ting Li,Huanhuan Su,Yao He",,2023.0

Análisis observacional retrospectivo y unicéntrico de pacientes con diagnóstico de HIE confirmado por TCCSC entre enero de 2016 y abril de 2018. Se incluyeron pacientes con HIE > 18 años y con TCCSC realizado dentro de las primeras 24 horas del inicio de los síntomas. Se excluyeron los HIE secundarios y en los que no se disponía de las variables de radiómica. Se recogieron datos clínicos, demográficos y variables al ingreso. Los pacientes se clasificaron según la Escala Modificada de Rankin (mRS) al alta en buen (mRS 0-2) y mal pronóstico (mRS 3-6). Tras la segmentación manual de la TCCSC de cada HIE se obtuvieron las variables de radiómica. La muestra se dividió en una cohorte de entrenamiento y prueba y otra cohorte de validación (70-30%, respectivamente). Se usaron diferentes métodos de selección de variables y reducción de dimensionalidad, así como diferentes algoritmos para la construcción del modelo. Se realizaron 10 iteraciones de validación cruzada estratificada en la cohorte de entrenamiento y prueba y se calculó la media de los valores de área bajo la curva (AUC). Una vez entrenados los modelos, se calculó la sensibilidad de cada uno para predecir el pronóstico funcional al alta en la cohorte de validación. Se analizaron 105 pacientes con HIE. Se evaluaron 105 variables de radiómica de cada paciente. Los algoritmos P-SVM, KNN-E y RF-10, en combinación con el método de selección de variables ANOVA, fueron los clasificadores con mejor rendimiento en la cohorte de entrenamiento y prueba (AUC: 0,798, 0,752 y 0,742, respectivamente). Las predicciones de estos modelos, en la cohorte de validación, tuvieron una sensibilidad de 0,897 (IC 95%: 0,778-1), con una tasa de falsos negativos del 0% para la predicción de mal pronóstico funcional al alta. Los clasificadores de aprendizaje supervisado no lineales basados en radiómica son una herramienta de diagnóstico prometedora para predecir el resultado funcional al alta en pacientes con HIE, con una baja tasa de falsos negativos, aunque todavía son necesarios estudios con mayor tamaño muestral y balanceados para desarrollar y mejorar su rendimiento. To evaluate if nonlinear supervised learning classifiers based on non-contrast cerebral CT can predict functional prognosis at discharge in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hematoma (HIE). Retrospective, single-center, observational analysis of patients with a diagnosis of spontaneous intracerebral hematoma confirmed by non-contrast CT between January 2016 and April 2018. Patients with HIE > 18 years and with non-contrast CT performed within the first 24 hours of symptom onset were included. Patients with secondary spontaneous intracerebral hematoma and in whom radiomic variables were not available were excluded. Clinical, demographic and admission variables were collected. Patients were classified according to the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at discharge into good (mRS 0-2) and poor prognosis (mRS 3-6). After manual segmentation of each spontaneous intracerebral hematoma, the radiomics variables were obtained. The sample was divided into a training and testing cohort and a validation cohort (70-30%, respectively). Different methods of variable selection and dimensionality reduction were used, and different algorithms were used for model construction. Stratified 10-fold cross-validation were performed on the training and testing cohort and the mean area under the curve (AUC) were calculated. Once the models were trained, the sensitivity of each was calculated to predict functional prognosis at discharge in the validation cohort. 105 patients with spontaneous intracerebral hematoma were analyzed. 105 radiomic variables were evaluated for each patient. P-SVM, KNN-E and RF-10 algorithms, in combination with the ANOVA variable selection method, were the best performing classifiers in the training and testing cohort (AUC: 0.798, 0.752 and 0.742, respectively). The predictions of these models, in the validation cohort, had a sensitivity of 0.897 (95% CI: 0.778-1), with a false-negative rate of 0% for predicting poor functional prognosis at discharge. The use of radiomics-based nonlinear supervised learning classifiers are a promising diagnostic tool for predicting functional outcome at discharge in HIE patients, with a low false negative rate, although larger and balanced samples are still needed to develop and improve their performance.","Elena Serrano,Javier Moreno,Laura Llull,A.

10.1186/s12891-023-06911-y,37803313.0,,Clinical and radiomics feature-based outcome analysis in lumbar disc herniation surgery,"Low back pain is a widely prevalent symptom and the foremost cause of disability on a global scale. Although various degenerative imaging findings observed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been linked to low back pain and disc herniation, none of them can be considered pathognomonic for this condition, given the high prevalence of abnormal findings in asymptomatic individuals. Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge regarding whether radiomics features in MRI images combined with clinical features can be useful for prediction modeling of treatment success. The objective of this study was to explore the potential of radiomics feature analysis combined with clinical features and artificial intelligence-based techniques (machine learning/deep learning) in identifying MRI predictors for the prediction of outcomes after lumbar disc herniation surgery.We included n = 172 patients who underwent discectomy due to disc herniation with preoperative T2-weighted MRI examinations. Extracted clinical features included sex, age, alcohol and nicotine consumption, insurance type, hospital length of stay (LOS), complications, operation time, ASA score, preoperative CRP, surgical technique (microsurgical versus full-endoscopic), and information regarding the experience of the performing surgeon (years of experience with the surgical technique and the number of surgeries performed at the time of surgery). The present study employed a semiautomatic region-growing volumetric segmentation algorithm to segment herniated discs. In addition, 3D-radiomics features, which characterize phenotypic differences based on intensity, shape, and texture, were extracted from the computed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. Selected features identified by feature importance analyses were utilized for both machine learning and deep learning models (n = 17 models).The mean accuracy over all models for training and testing in the combined feature set was 93.31 ± 4.96 and 88.17 ± 2.58. The mean accuracy for training and testing in the clinical feature set was 91.28 ± 4.56 and 87.69 ± 3.62.Our results suggest a minimal but detectable improvement in predictive tasks when radiomics features are included. However, the extent of this advantage should be considered with caution, emphasizing the potential of exploring multimodal data inputs in future predictive modeling.","Babak Saravi,Alisia Zink,Sara Ülkümen,Sébastien Couillard‐Després,Jakob Wollborn,Gernot Lang,Frank Hassel",,2023.0

Handcrafted and deep learning features were extracted from preoperative contrast-enhanced CT images and selected to build three radiomics signatures (radiomics signature [Rad_Sig], deep learning signature [DL_Sig] and deep learning radiomics signature [DLR_Sig]) to predict risk categorization of TETs. A deep learning-based radiomic nomogram (DLRN) was then depicted to visualize the classification evaluation. The performance of predictive models was compared using the receiver operating characteristic and decision curve analysis (DCA).ResultsAmong three radiomics signatures, DLR_Sig demonstrated optimum performance with an AUC of 0.883 for the derivation cohort and 0.749 for the external test cohort. Combining DLR_Sig with age and gender, DLRN was depict and exhibited optimum performance among all radiomics models with an AUC of 0.965, accuracy of 0.911, sensitivity of 0.921 and specificity of 0.902 in the derivation cohort, and an AUC of 0.786, accuracy of 0.774, sensitivity of 0.778 and specificity of 0.771 in the external test cohort. The DCA showed that DLRN had greater clinical benefit than other radiomics signatures.ConclusionsOur study developed and validated a DLRN to accurately predict the risk categorization of TETs, which has potential to facilitate individualized treatment and improve patient prognosis evaluation.","Hao Zhou,Harrison X.

In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a multi-modal deep learning model to predict the efficacy of bevacizumab in patients with initially unresectable CRLM using baseline PET/CT, clinical data, and colonoscopy biopsy specimens.In this multicentre cohort study, we retrospectively collected data of 307 patients with CRLM from the BECOME study (NCT01972490) (Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai) and two independent Chinese cohorts (internal validation cohort from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 at Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University; external validation cohort from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 at Zhongshan Hospital-Xiamen, Shanghai, and the First Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou). The main inclusion criteria were that patients with CRLM had pre-treatment PET/CT images as well as colonoscopy specimens. After extracting PET/CT features with deep neural networks (DNN) and selecting related clinical factors using LASSO analysis, a random forest classifier was built as the Deep Radiomics Bevacizumab efficacy predicting model (DERBY). Furthermore, by combining histopathological biomarkers into DERBY, we established DERBY+. The performance of model was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.DERBY achieved promising performance in predicting bevacizumab sensitivity with an AUC of 0.77 and 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.67-0.87]. After combining histopathological features, we developed DERBY+, which had more robust accuracy for predicting tumour response in external validation cohort (AUC 0.83 and 95% CI [0.75-0.92], sensitivity 80.4%, specificity 76.8%). DERBY+ also had prognostic value: the responders had longer progression-free survival (median progression-free survival: 9.6 vs 6.3 months, p = 0.002) and overall survival (median overall survival: 27.6 vs 18.5 months, p = 0.010) than non-responders.This multi-modal deep radiomics model, using PET/CT, clinical data and histopathological data, was able to identify patients with bevacizumab-sensitive CRLM, providing a favourable approach for precise patient treatment.

Methods: 460 patients with 466 pathology-confirmed BCs who underwent breast mpMRI at 1.5T in our center were retrospectively included hormone receptor (HR) positive (HR+) (n=336) and HR negative (HR-) (n=130). The HR- patients were further categorized into human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) enriched BC (HEBC) (n=76) and triple negative BC (TNBC) (n=54). All lesions were divided into a training/validation cohort (n=337) and a test cohort (n=129). Volumes of interest (VOIs) delineation, followed by radiomics feature extraction, was performed on T2WI, DWI 600 (b=600 s/mm 2 ), DWI 800 (b=800 s/mm 2 ), ADC map, and DCE 1-6 (six continuous DCE-MRI) images of each lesion. Simulating a radiologist’s work pattern, 150 classification base models were constructed and analyzed to determine the top four optimum sequences for classifying HR+ vs. HR-, TNBC vs. HEBC, TNBC vs. non-TNBC in a random selected training cohort (n=337). Building upon these findings, the optimal single sequence models (Rss) and combined sequences models (R FF ) were developed. The AUC, sensitivity, accuracy and specificity of each model for subtype differentiation were evaluated. The paired samples Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for performance comparison. Results: During the three classification tasks, the optimal single sequence for classifying HR+ vs. HR- was DWI 600 , while the ADC map, derived from DWI 800 performed the best in distinguishing TNBC vs. HEBC, as well as identifying TNBC vs. non-TNBC, with corresponding training AUC values of 0.787, 0.788, and 0.809, respectively. Furthermore, the integration of the top four sequences in R FF models yielded improved performance, achieving AUC values of 0.809, 0.805 and 0.847, respectively.

Methods Patients with spinal metastases who were treated using SBRT at our hospital between July 2018 and April 2023 were recruited. We assessed their response to treatment using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1). The lesions were categorized into progressive disease (PD) and non-PD groups. Radiomics features were extracted from T1-weighted image (T1WI), T2-weighted image (T2WI), and fat-suppression T2WI sequences. Feature selection involved intraclass correlation coefficients, minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator methods. Thirteen ML algorithms were employed to construct the radiomics prediction models. Clinical, conventional imaging, and radiomics features were integrated to develop combined models. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and the clinical value was assessed using decision curve analysis. Results We included 194 patients with 142 (73.2%) lesions in the non-PD group and 52 (26.8%) in the PD group. Each region of interest generated 2264 features. The clinical model exhibited a moderate predictive value (area under the ROC curve, AUC = 0.733), while the radiomics models demonstrated better performance (AUC = 0.745–0.825). The combined model achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.828). Conclusion The MRI-based radiomics models exhibited valuable predictive capability for treatment outcomes in patients with spinal metastases undergoing SBRT. Critical relevance statement Radiomics prediction models have the potential to contribute to clinical decision-making and improve the prognosis of patients with spinal metastases undergoing SBRT. Key points • Stereotactic body radiotherapy effectively delivers high doses of radiation to treat spinal metastases. • Accurate prediction of treatment outcomes has crucial clinical significance. • MRI-based radiomics models demonstrated good performance to predict treatment outcomes.

A total of 52 patients with LPA and 44 patients with sPHEO were randomly assigned to training/testing sets in a 7:3 ratio. Additionally, a validation set was comprised of 22 LPA cases and 16 sPHEO cases from two other hospitals. We used 3D Slicer and PyRadiomics to segment tumors and extract radiomic features, respectively. We then applied T-test and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to select features. Six binary classifiers, including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), were employed to differentiate LPA from sPHEO. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) values were compared using DeLong's method.All six classifiers showed good diagnostic performance for each phase and slice thickness, as well as for the entire CT data, with AUC values ranging from 0.706 to 1. Non-contrast CT densities of LPA were significantly lower than those of sPHEO (P < 0.001). However, using the optimal threshold for non-contrast CT density, sensitivity was only 0.743, specificity 0.744, and AUC 0.828. Delayed phase CT density yielded a sensitivity of 0.971, specificity of 0.641, and AUC of 0.814. In radiomics, AUC values for the testing set using non-contrast CT images were: KNN 0.919, LR 0.979, DT 0.835, RF 0.967, SVM 0.979, and MLP 0.981. In the validation set, AUC values were: KNN 0.891, LR 0.974, DT 0.891, RF 0.964, SVM 0.949, and MLP 0.979.The machine learning model based on CT radiomics can accurately differentiate LPA from sPHEO, even using non-contrast CT data alone, making contrast-enhanced CT unnecessary for diagnosing LPA and sPHEO.","Daoxiong Xiao,Jianping Zhong,Jidong Peng,C.

Materials and methods Five hundred and sixty-eight patients were included in this study, who were diagnosed pathologically as having meningiomas. Firstly, radiomics features were extracted from CE-T1, T2, and 1-cm-thick tumor-to-brain interface (BTI) images. Then, difference analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were orderly used to select the most representative features. Next, the support vector machine algorithm was conducted to predict the WHO grade of meningioma. Furthermore, a nomogram incorporated radiomics features and valuable clinical indicators was constructed by logistic regression. The performance of the nomogram was assessed by calibration and clinical effectiveness, as well as internal validation. Results Peritumoral edema volume and gender are independent risk factors for predicting meningioma grade. The multiparametric MRI features incorporating CE-T1, T2, and BTI features showed the higher performance for prediction of meningioma grade with a pooled AUC = 0.885 (95% CI, 0.821–0.946) and 0.860 (95% CI, 0.788–0.923) in the training and test groups, respectively. Then, a nomogram with a pooled AUC = 0.912 (95% CI, 0.876–0.961), combined radiomics score, peritumoral edema volume, and gender improved diagnostic performance compared to radiomics model or clinical model and showed good calibration as the true results. Moreover, decision curve analysis demonstrated satisfactory clinical effectiveness of the proposed nomogram. Conclusions A novel nomogram is simple yet effective in differentiating WHO grades of meningioma and thus can be used in patients with meningiomas.

However, conventional radiological characteristics obtained by computed tomography (CT) are not sufficient to predict the nuclear grade of small ccRCC before surgery. Methods A total of 113 patients with histologically confirmed ccRCC were randomly assigned to the training set (n = 67) and the testing set (n = 46). The baseline and CT imaging data of the patients were evaluated statistically to develop a clinical model. A radiomics model was created, and the radiomics score (Rad-score) was calculated by extracting radiomics features from the CT images. Then, a clinical radiomics nomogram was developed using multivariate logistic regression analysis by combining the Rad-score and critical clinical characteristics. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the discrimination of small ccRCC in both the training and testing sets. Results The radiomics model was constructed using six features obtained from the CT images. The shape and relative enhancement value of the nephrographic phase (REV of the NP) were found to be independent risk factors in the clinical model. The area under the curve (AUC) values for the training and testing sets for the clinical radiomics nomogram were 0.940 and 0.902, respectively. Decision curve analysis (DCA) revealed that the radiomics nomogram model was a better predictor, with the highest degree of coincidence.

Methods In total, 167 consecutive STEMI patients were retrospectively enrolled. The patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts with a ratio of 7:3. All patients were diagnosed with myocardial infarction with or without MVO based on late gadolinium enhancement imaging. Radiomics features were extracted from the cine CMR end-diastolic volume phase of the entire left ventricular myocardium (3D volume). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was employed to select the features that were most relevant to the MVO; these features were then used to calculate the radiomics score (Rad-score). A combined model was developed based on independent risk factors screened using multivariate regression analysis and visualized using a nomogram. Performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results The univariate analysis of clinical features demonstrated that only cardiac troponin I (cTNI) was significantly associated with MVO. LASSO regression revealed that 12 radiomics features were strongly associated with MVO. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that cTNI and Rad-score were independent risk factors for MVO. The nomogram based on these two features achieved an area under the curve of 0.86 and 0.78 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Calibration curves and DCA indicated the clinical feasibility and utility of the nomogram. Conclusions A CMR-based radiomics nomogram offers an effective means of predicting MVO without contrast agents and radiation, which could facilitate risk stratification of patients with STEMI after PCI for reperfusion.","Xiaowen Liu,Ting Xu,Yongjia Peng,Jialin Yuan,Shuxing Wang,Wuyan Xu,Jingshan Gong",,2023.0

Radiomics analysis relies on quantification of image characteristics. We evaluated the impact of different VMI reconstructions on radiomic features in in vitro and in vivo PCD-CT datasets. Methods An organic phantom consisting of twelve samples (four oranges, four onions, and four apples) was scanned five times. Twenty-three patients who had undergone coronary computed tomography angiography on a first generation PCD-CT system with the same image acquisitions were analyzed. VMIs were reconstructed at 6 keV levels (40, 55, 70, 90, 120, and 190 keV). The phantoms and the patients’ left ventricular myocardium (LVM) were segmented for all reconstructions. Ninety-three original radiomic features were extracted. Repeatability and reproducibility were evaluated through intraclass correlations coefficient (ICC) and post hoc paired samples ANOVA t test. Results There was excellent repeatability for radiomic features in phantom scans (all ICC = 1.00). Among all VMIs, 36/93 radiomic features (38.7%) in apples, 28/93 (30.1%) in oranges, and 33/93 (35.5%) in onions were not significantly different. For LVM, the percentage of stable features was high between VMIs ≥ 90 keV (90 versus 120 keV, 77.4%; 90 versus 190 keV, 83.9%; 120 versus 190 keV, 89.3%), while comparison to lower VMI levels led to fewer reproducible features (40 versus 55 keV, 8.6%). Conclusions VMI levels influence the stability of radiomic features in an organic phantom and patients’ LVM; stability decreases considerably below 90 keV. Relevance statement Spectral reconstructions significantly influence radiomic features in vitro and in vivo , necessitating standardization and careful attention to these reconstruction parameters before clinical implementation. Key points • Radiomic features have an excellent repeatability within the same PCD-CT acquisition and reconstruction. • Differences in VMI lead to decreased reproducibility for radiomic features. • VMI ≥ 90 keV increased the reproducibility of the radiomic features.

Unfortunately, some patients respond poorly. To predict response to radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy in pre-treatment patients with esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESCC), and compare the predicting efficacies of radiomics features of primary tumor with or without regional lymph nodes, we developed a radiomics-clinical model based on the positioning CT images. Finally, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) was used to explain the models. Methods This retrospective study enrolled 105 patients with medically inoperable and/or unresectable ESCC who underwent radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) between October 2018 and May 2023. Patients were classified into responder and non-responder groups with RECIST standards. The 11 recently admitted patients were chosen as the validation set, previously admitted patients were randomly split into the training set ( n = 70) and the testing set ( n = 24). Primary tumor site (GTV), the primary tumor and the uninvolved lymph nodes at risk of microscopic disease (CTV) were identified as Regions of Interests (ROIs). 1762 radiomics features from GTV and CTV were respectively extracted and then filtered by statistical differential analysis and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The filtered radiomics features combined with 13 clinical features were further filtered with Mutual Information (MI) algorithm. Based on the filtered features, we developed five models (Clinical Model, GTV Model, GTV-Clinical Model, CTV Model, and CTV-Clinical Model) using the random forest algorithm and evaluated for their accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score and AUC. Finally, SHAP algorithm was adopted for model interpretation to achieve transparency and utilizability. Results The GTV-Clinical model achieves an AUC of 0.82 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.76–0.99 on testing set and an AUC of 0.97 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.84–1.0 on validation set, which are significantly higher than those of other models in predicting ESCC response to CCRT. The SHAP force map provides an integrated view of the impact of each feature on individual patients, while the SHAP summary plots indicate that radiomics features have a greater influence on model prediction than clinical factors in our model. Conclusion GTV-Clinical model based on texture features and the maximum diameter of lesion (MDL) may assist clinicians in pre-treatment predicting ESCC response to CCRT.","Cheng Xu,Jintao Zhang,Min Zhu,Ruixia Sun,Lingling Liu,Xueling Li",,2023.0

Patients with MCN and IPMN require surgery due to the potential of malignant transformation, whereas those with SCN require periodic surveillance. However, the differential diagnosis of patients with PCNs before treatment remains a great challenge for all surgeons. Therefore, the establishment of a reliable diagnostic tool is urgently required for the improvement of precision diagnostics.Between February 2015 and December 2020, 143 consecutive patients with PCNs who were confirmed by postoperative pathology were retrospectively included in the study cohort, then randomized into development and test cohorts at a ratio of 7:3. The predictors of preoperative clinical-radiologic parameters were evaluated by univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses. A total of 1,218 radiomics features were computationally extracted from the enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans of the tumor region, and a radiomics signature was established by the random forest algorithm. In the development cohort, multi- and binary-class radiomics models integrating preoperative variables and radiomics features were constructed to distinguish between the 3 types of PCNs. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the predictive efficiency of the model. An independent internal test cohort was applied to validate the classification models.All preoperative prediction models were built by integrating the radiomics signature with 13 diagnosis-related radiomics features and 3 important clinical-radiologic parameters: age, sex, and tumor diameter. The multiclass prediction model presented an overall accuracy of 0.804 in the development cohort and 0.707 in the test cohort. The binary-class prediction models displayed higher overall accuracies of 0.853, 0.866, and 0.928 in the development dataset and 0.750, 0.839, and 0.889 in the test dataset. In the test cohort, the binary-class radiomics models showed better predictive performances {AUC =0.914 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.786 to 1.000], 0.863 (95% CI: 0.714 to 0.941), and 0.926 (95% CI: 0.824 to 1.000)} than the multiclass radiomics model [AUC =0.850 (95% CI: 0.696 to 1.000)], with a large net benefit in the decision curve analysis (DCA).

Methods 68 patients were included. Radiomic features of the pancreas were extracted from the arterial phase of computed tomography (CT) at a 1 mm slice thickness for each patient. the Radiomic features with highest correlation with POPF for our models, controlling for autocorrelation and applying Bonferroni correction for P-values were selected. For amylase prediction model (APM), radiomic features were correlated with postoperative maximum drain amylase levels at a cut-off of 1000U/l. ROC analysis was performed for evaluation of the resulting prediction models. Results POPF prediction model (PPM) showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.897 (confidence interval (CI) = 82.3–97.1%) in the cohort. The AUC of PPM was higher than that for Roberts’ score, but the difference was not statistically significant. An attempt to predict postoperative amylase dynamics in the drainage fluid achieved an AUC of 0.936 (CI = 88%-99.1%). Conclusions Preoperative prediction of POPF and drain amylase dynamics using radiomics showed promising results. Both models offer new approaches to the clinical management of POPF.","Johannes D.

Concordance indexes (C-indexes) and Cox proportional hazards ratios (HRs) of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were pooled via random-effects modeling. For studies aimed at classifying long-term and short-term PFS, a hierarchical regression model was used to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the Higgin inconsistency index (I2). Subgroup regression analysis was performed to find potential factors contributing to heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed via funnel plots and the Egger test.Among 1371 abstracts, 18 and 17 studies were included for qualitative and quantitative data synthesis, respectively. Respective pooled C-indexes and HRs for OS were 0.65 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.72) and 2.88 (95 % CI, 2.28-3.64), whereas those for PFS were 0.61 (95 % CI, 0.55-0.66) and 2.78 (95 % CI, 1.91-4.03). Among 4 studies that predicted short-term PFS, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.77 (95 % CI, 0.58-0.89) and 0.60 (95 % CI, 0.45-0.73), respectively. There was a substantial between-study heterogeneity among studies with the survival endpoint of OS C-index (n = 9, I2 = 83.8 %). Publication bias was not observed overall.Pretreatment MR-based radiomics provided modest prognostic value in both OS and PFS in patients with glioblastoma.","Yangsean Choi,Jinhee Jang,Bum Soo Kim,Kook Jin Ahn",,2023.0

10.3390/sym15101834,,,Radiomics and Its Feature Selection: A Review,"Medical imaging plays an indispensable role in evaluating, predicting, and monitoring a range of medical conditions. Radiomics, a specialized branch of medical imaging, utilizes quantitative features extracted from medical images to describe underlying pathologies, genetic information, and prognostic indicators. The integration of radiomics with artificial intelligence presents innovative avenues for cancer diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and therapeutic choices. In the context of oncology, radiomics offers significant potential. Feature selection emerges as a pivotal step, enhancing the clinical utility and precision of radiomics. It achieves this by purging superfluous and unrelated features, thereby augmenting model performance and generalizability. The goal of this review is to assess the fundamental radiomics process and the progress of feature selection methods, explore their applications and challenges in cancer research, and provide theoretical and methodological support for future investigations. Through an extensive literature survey, articles pertinent to radiomics and feature selection were garnered, synthesized, and appraised. The paper provides detailed descriptions of how radiomics is applied and challenged in different cancer types and their various stages. The review also offers comparative insights into various feature selection strategies, including filtering, packing, and embedding methodologies. Conclusively, the paper broaches the limitations and prospective trajectories of radiomics.","Wenchao Zhang,Yi Guo,Qiyu Jin",,2023.0
10.21037/jgo-23-627,37969820.0,,Radiomics based on machine learning algorithms could predict prognosis and postoperative chemotherapy benefits of patients with gastric cancer: a retrospective cohort study,"Traditional clinical characteristics have certain limitations in evaluating cancer prognosis. The radiomics features provide information on tumor morphology, tissue texture, and hemodynamics, which can accurately reflect personalized predictions. This study investigated the clinical value of radiomics features on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images in predicting prognosis and postoperative chemotherapy benefits for patients with gastric cancer (GC).For this study, 171 GC patients who underwent radical gastrectomy and pathology confirmation of the malignancy at the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University were retrospectively enrolled. The general information, pathological characteristics, and postoperative chemotherapy information were collected. Patients were also monitored through telephone interviews or outpatient treatment. GC patients were randomly divided into the developing cohort (n=120) and validation cohort (n=51). The intra-tumor areas of interest inside the tumors were delineated, and 1,218 radiomics features were extracted. The optimal radiomics risk score (RRS) was constructed using 8 machine learning algorithms and 29 algorithm combinations. Furthermore, a radiomics nomogram that included clinicopathological characteristics was constructed and validated through univariate and multivariate Cox analyses.Eleven prognosis-related features were selected, and an RRS was constructed. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that the RRS had a high prognostic ability in the developing and validation cohorts (log-rank P<0.01). The RRS was higher in patients with a larger tumor size (≥3 cm), higher Charlson score (≥2), and higher clinical stage (Stages III and IV) (all P<0.001). Furthermore, GC patients with a higher RRS significantly benefited from postoperative chemotherapy. The results of univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that the RRS was an independent risk factor for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P<0.001). A visual nomogram was established based on the significant factors in multivariate Cox analysis (P<0.05). The C-index was 0.835 (0.793-0.877) for OS and 0.733 (0.677-0.789) for DFS in the developing cohort. The calibration curve also showed that the nomogram had good agreement.A nomogram that combines the RRS and clinicopathological characteristics could serve as a novel noninvasive preoperative prediction model with the potential to accurately predict the prognosis and chemotherapy benefits of GC patients.","Yingying Xiang,Yuanbo Hu,Chenbin Chen,Hui Zhi,Zhigang Zhao,Mingdong Lu,Xiao Chen,Luo Zhi-xian,Sian Chen,Emmanuel Dias‐Neto,Paolo Pizzini,Xinxin Chen,Yuandi Zhuang,Qian-Tong Dong",,2023.0

In this study, we analyzed the clinical and ultrasound radiomics(USR) features of TN in patients with HT and constructed a model for differentiating benign and malignant nodules specifically in this population. Methods We retrospectively collected clinical and ultrasound data from 227 patients with TN and concomitant HT(161 for training, 66 for testing). Two experienced sonographers delineated the TG and TN regions, and USR features were extracted using Python. Lasso regression and logistic analysis were employed to select relevant USR features and clinical data to construct the model for differentiating benign and malignant TN. The performance of the model was evaluated using area under the curve(AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis(DCA). Results A total of 1,162 USR features were extracted from TN and the TG in the 227 patients with HT. Lasso regression identified 14 features, which were used to construct the TN score, TG score, and TN+TG score. Univariate analysis identified six clinical predictors: TI-RADS, echoic type, aspect ratio, boundary, calcification, and thyroid function. Multivariable analysis revealed that incorporating USR scores improved the performance of the model for differentiating benign and malignant TN in patients with HT. Specifically, the TN+TG score resulted in the highest increase in AUC(from 0.83 to 0.94) in the clinical prediction model. Calibration curves and DCA demonstrated higher accuracy and net benefit for the TN+TG+clinical model. Conclusion USR features of both the TG and TN can be utilized for differentiating benign and malignant TN in patients with HT. These findings highlight the importance of considering the entire TG in the evaluation of TN in HT patients, providing valuable insights for clinical decision-making in this population.","Fang Mengyuan,Mengjie Lei,Xuexue Chen,Hong Chen,Xingxing Duan,Yuan Huang,Lanwei Guo",,2023.0
10.3390/cancers15194677,37835371.0,,The Era of Immunotherapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The New Mission and Challenges of Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"In recent years, significant advancements in immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have shown the potential to further improve the prognosis of patients with advanced HCC. However, in clinical practice, there is still a lack of effective biomarkers for identifying the patient who would benefit from immunotherapy and predicting the tumor response to immunotherapy. The immune microenvironment of HCC plays a crucial role in tumor development and drug responses. However, due to the complexity of immune microenvironment, currently, no single pathological or molecular biomarker can effectively predict tumor responses to immunotherapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images provide rich biological information; existing studies suggest the feasibility of using MRI to assess the immune microenvironment of HCC and predict tumor responses to immunotherapy. Nevertheless, there are limitations, such as the suboptimal performance of conventional MRI sequences, incomplete feature extraction in previous deep learning methods, and limited interpretability. Further study needs to combine qualitative features, quantitative parameters, multi-omics characteristics related to the HCC immune microenvironment, and various deep learning techniques in multi-center research cohorts. Subsequently, efforts should also be undertaken to construct and validate a visual predictive tool of tumor response, and assess its predictive value for patient survival benefits. Additionally, future research endeavors must aim to provide an accurate, efficient, non-invasive, and highly interpretable method for predicting the effectiveness of immune therapy.","Yidi Chen,Chongtu Yang,Liuji Sheng,Hanyu Jiang,Bin Song",,2023.0

Methods: We retrospectively included 98 patients with cervical cancer (54 well/moderately differentiated and 44 poorly differentiated). Radiomics features were extracted from T2WI Axi and T2WI Sag. Feature selection was performed by intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), t-test, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) were used as the first-layer base classifier, and LR as the second-layer meta-classifier in stacking ensemble learning model. The model performance was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy. Results: In the basic classifiers, the XGB model showed the best performance, the average AUC was 0.74(0.69,0.76) and the accuracy was 0.73. It was followed by SVM, LR and KNN models, and the average AUC were 0.73(0.66,0.80), 0.71(0.62,0.78) and 0.66(0.61,0.72), respectively. The performance of stacking ensemble model showed effective improvement, with an average AUC of 0.77(0.67,0.84), and the accuracy was 0.83. Conclusions: The ensemble learning model based on conventional non-enhanced MRI sequences could identify poorly differentiated cervical cancer from well/moderately differentiated cervical cancer, and can provide more references for preoperative non-invasive assessment of cervical cancer.","Zhiyuan He,Fajin Lv,Chengwei Li,Liu Yang,Zhibo Xiao",,2023.0

This study was designed to develop and validate a radiomics model to predict benign and malignant VCFs with 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( 18 F-FDG-PET/CT). Results Twenty-six features (9 PET features and 17 CT features) and eight clinical variables (age, SUVmax, SUVpeak, SULmax, SULpeak, osteolytic destruction, fracture line, and appendices/posterior vertebrae involvement) were ultimately selected. The area under the curve (AUCs) of the radiomics and clinical–radiomics models were significantly different from that of the clinical model in both the training group (0.986, 0.987 vs. 0.884, p &lt; 0.05) and test group (0.962, 0.948 vs. 0.858, p &lt; 0.05), while there was no significant difference between the radiomics model and clinical–radiomics model ( p &gt; 0.05). The accuracies of the radiomics and clinical–radiomics models were 94.0% and 95.0% in the training group and 93.2% and 93.2% in the test group, respectively. The three models all showed good calibration (Hosmer–Lemeshow test, p &gt; 0.05). According to the decision curve analysis (DCA), the radiomics model and clinical–radiomics model exhibited higher overall net benefit than the clinical model. Conclusions The PET/CT-based radiomics and clinical–radiomics models showed good performance in distinguishing between malignant and benign VCFs.

We aim to investigate the value of MRI-based radiomics signature in the prognosis for patients with nasal ENKTL. Methods 159 nasal ENKTL patients were enrolled and divided into a training cohort (n = 81) and a validation cohort (n = 78) randomly. Radiomics features from pretreatment MRI examination were extracted respectively. Then two sample t-test and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were used to select the radiomics signatures and establish the Rad-score. A radiomics nomogram based on the Rad-score and clinical features was constructed to predict overall survival (OS). Results The radiomics model that integrated Rad-score and clinical risk factors exhibited a satisfactory prediction performance compared with the Rad-score and clinical models in terms of OS in the training cohort (C-index: 0.849 vs. 0.733 vs. 0.707, AUC: 0.896 vs. 0.767 vs.0.798). For validation, the C-index of the three models was 0.931 vs. 0.824 vs. 0.635 respectively. Moreover, the AUC was 0.839 vs. 0.827 vs. 0.583 respectively. The calibration curves also suggested that the net benefit of radiomics models was higher than that of the Rad-score and clinical models. Conclusions The Rad-score was significantly correlated with OS for nasal ENKTL patients. Moreover, the MRI-based radiomics nomogram could be used for risk stratification and provide personalized treatment plans for patients.","Limin Chen,Zhao Wang,Xiaojie Fang,M. H.

10.1055/a-2175-4622,37944935.0,,Imaging-based characterization of tumoral heterogeneity for personalized cancer treatment,"With personalized tumor therapy, understanding and addressing the heterogeneity of malignant tumors is becoming increasingly important. Heterogeneity can be found within one lesion (intralesional) and between several tumor lesions emerging from one primary tumor (interlesional). The heterogeneous tumor cells may show a different response to treatment due to their biology, which in turn influences the outcome of the affected patients and the choice of therapeutic agents. Therefore, both intra- and interlesional heterogeneity should be addressed at the diagnostic stage. While genetic and biological heterogeneity are important parameters in molecular tumor characterization and in histopathology, they are not yet addressed routinely in medical imaging. This article summarizes the recently established markers for tumor heterogeneity in imaging as well as heterogeneous/mixed response to therapy. Furthermore, a look at emerging markers is given. The ultimate goal of this overview is to provide comprehensive understanding of tumor heterogeneity and its implications for radiology and for communication with interdisciplinary teams in oncology.

Incorporating MRI could represent a leap forward, although poor sensitivity and standardization represent unsolved issues. MRI radiomics has been proposed for EPE prediction. The aim of the study was to systematically review the literature and perform a meta-analysis of MRI-based radiomics approaches for EPE prediction. Materials and methods Multiple databases were systematically searched for radiomics studies on EPE detection up to June 2022. Methodological quality was appraised according to Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool and radiomics quality score (RQS). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) was pooled to estimate predictive accuracy. A random-effects model estimated overall effect size. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed with I 2 value. Publication bias was evaluated with a funnel plot. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity. Results Thirteen studies were included, showing limitations in study design and methodological quality (median RQS 10/36), with high statistical heterogeneity. Pooled AUC for EPE identification was 0.80. In subgroup analysis, test-set and cross-validation-based studies had pooled AUC of 0.85 and 0.89 respectively. Pooled AUC was 0.72 for deep learning (DL)–based and 0.82 for handcrafted radiomics studies and 0.79 and 0.83 for studies with multiple and single scanner data, respectively. Finally, models with the best predictive performance obtained using radiomics features showed pooled AUC of 0.82, while those including clinical data of 0.76. Conclusion MRI radiomics–powered models to identify EPE in PCa showed a promising predictive performance overall. However, methodologically robust, clinically driven research evaluating their diagnostic and therapeutic impact is still needed. Clinical relevance statement Radiomics might improve the management of prostate cancer patients increasing the value of MRI in the assessment of extraprostatic extension. However, it is imperative that forthcoming research prioritizes confirmation studies and a stronger clinical orientation to solidify these advancements. Key Points • MRI radiomics deserves attention as a tool to overcome the limitations of MRI in prostate cancer local staging. • Pooled AUC was 0.80 for the 13 included studies, with high heterogeneity (84.7%, p &lt; .001), methodological issues, and poor clinical orientation. • Methodologically robust radiomics research needs to focus on increasing MRI sensitivity and bringing added value to clinical nomograms at patient level.","Andrea Ponsiglione,Michele Gambardella,Arnaldo Stanzione,Roberta Green,Valeria Cantoni,Carmela Nappi,Felice Crocetto,Renato Cuocolo,A.

There were three main outcomes assessed in included studies: recurrence (6 studies), progression-free survival (2 studies), and prediction of human papillomavirus (HPV) status (1 study). Radiomics-based risk stratification models were found to provide valuable insights into treatment response and patient outcomes, with all developed signatures demonstrating at least modest accuracy (range: .68-1.0) in predicting their primary outcome. Conclusion Radiomics has emerged as a promising tool in the management of anal cancer. It offers the potential for improved risk stratification, treatment planning, and response assessment, thereby guiding personalized therapeutic approaches.","Hugo Temperley,Niall J.

,,,Radiomics strategies for risk assessment of tumour failure in head-and-neck cancer,"Quantitative extraction of high-dimensional mineable data from medical images is a process known as radiomics. Radiomics is foreseen as an essential prognostic tool for cancer risk assessment and the quantification of intratumoural heterogeneity. In this work, 1615 radiomic features (quantifying tumour image intensity, shape, texture) extracted from pre-treatment FDG-PET and CT images of 300 patients from four different cohorts were analyzed for the risk assessment of locoregional recurrences (LR) and distant metastases (DM) in head-and-neck cancer. Prediction models combining radiomic and clinical variables were constructed via random forests and imbalance-adjustment strategies using two of the four cohorts. Independent validation of the prediction and prognostic performance of the models was carried out on the other two cohorts (LR: AUC = 0.69 and CI = 0.67; DM: AUC = 0.86 and CI = 0.88). Furthermore, the results obtained via Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated the potential of radiomics for assessing the risk of specific tumour outcomes using multiple stratification groups.

Lack of reproducibility and validation of high-throughput quantitative image analysis studies is considered to be a major challenge for the field. Part of this challenge lies in the scantiness of consensus-based guidelines and definitions for the process of translating acquired imaging into high-throughput image biomarkers.

,,,A multicenter study on radiomic features from T$_2$-weighted images of a customized MR pelvic phantom setting the basis for robust radiomic models in clinics,"In this study we investigated the repeatability and reproducibility of radiomic features extracted from MRI images and provide a workflow to identify robust features. 2D and 3D T$_2$-weighted images of a pelvic phantom were acquired on three scanners of two manufacturers and two magnetic field strengths. The repeatability and reproducibility of the radiomic features were assessed respectively by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), considering repeated acquisitions with or without phantom repositioning, and with different scanner/acquisition type, and acquisition parameters. The features showing ICC/CCC > 0.9 were selected, and their dependence on shape information (Spearman's $\rho$> 0.8) was analyzed. They were classified for their ability to distinguish textures, after shuffling voxel intensities. From 944 2D features, 79.9% to 96.4% showed excellent repeatability in fixed position across all scanners. Much lower range (11.2% to 85.4%) was obtained after phantom repositioning. 3D extraction did not improve repeatability performance. Excellent reproducibility between scanners was observed in 4.6% to 15.6% of the features, at fixed imaging parameters. 82.4% to 94.9% of features showed excellent agreement when extracted from images acquired with TEs 5 ms apart (values decreased when increasing TE intervals) and 90.7% of the features exhibited excellent reproducibility for changes in TR. 2.0% of non-shape features were identified as providing only shape information. This study demonstrates that radiomic features are affected by specific MRI protocols. The use of our radiomic pelvic phantom allowed to identify unreliable features for radiomic analysis on T$_2$-weighted images. This paper proposes a general workflow to identify repeatable, reproducible, and informative radiomic features, fundamental to ensure robustness of clinical studies.","Linda Bianchini,João Santinha,Linda Bianchini,Nuno Loução,João Santinha,Mário A.

,,,Reliability and prognostic value of radiomic features are highly dependent on choice of feature extraction platform.,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative (IBSI) compliance, harmonisation of calculation settings and platform version on the statistical reliability of radiomic features and their corresponding ability to predict clinical outcome. METHODS The statistical reliability of radiomic features was assessed retrospectively in three clinical datasets (patient numbers: 108 head and neck cancer, 37 small-cell lung cancer, 47 non-small-cell lung cancer). Features were calculated using four platforms (PyRadiomics, LIFEx, CERR and IBEX). PyRadiomics, LIFEx and CERR are IBSI-compliant, whereas IBEX is not. The effects of IBSI compliance, user-defined calculation settings and platform version were assessed by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients and confidence intervals. The influence of platform choice on the relationship between radiomic biomarkers and survival was evaluated using univariable cox regression in the largest dataset. RESULTS The reliability of radiomic features calculated by the different software platforms was only excellent (ICC > 0.9) for 4/17 radiomic features when comparing all four platforms. Reliability improved to ICC > 0.9 for 15/17 radiomic features when analysis was restricted to the three IBSI-compliant platforms. Failure to harmonise calculation settings resulted in poor reliability, even across the IBSI-compliant platforms. Software platform version also had a marked effect on feature reliability in CERR and LIFEx. Features identified as having significant relationship to survival varied between platforms, as did the direction of hazard ratios. CONCLUSION IBSI compliance, user-defined calculation settings and choice of platform version all influence the statistical reliability and corresponding performance of prognostic models in radiomics. KEY POINTS • Reliability of radiomic features varies between feature calculation platforms and with choice of software version. • Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative (IBSI) compliance improves reliability of radiomic features across platforms, but only when calculation settings are harmonised. • IBSI compliance, user-defined calculation settings and choice of platform version collectively affect the prognostic value of features.","Isabella Fornacon-Wood,Hitesh Mistry,Isabella Fornacon-Wood,Isabella Fornacon-Wood,Hitesh Mistry,Christoph Ackermann,Christoph J.

,,,Improving Prognostic Performance in Resectable Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma using Radiomics and Deep Learning Features Fusion in CT Images,"As an analytic pipeline for quantitative imaging feature extraction and analysis, radiomics has grown rapidly in the past a few years. Recent studies in radiomics aim to investigate the relationship between tumors imaging features and clinical outcomes. Open source radiomics feature banks enable the extraction and analysis of thousands of predefined features. On the other hand, recent advances in deep learning have shown significant potential in the quantitative medical imaging field, raising the research question of whether predefined radiomics features have predictive information in addition to deep learning features. In this study, we propose a feature fusion method and investigate whether a combined feature bank of deep learning and predefined radiomics features can improve the prognostics performance. CT images from resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients were used to compare the prognosis performance of common feature reduction and fusion methods and the proposed risk-score based feature fusion method for overall survival. It was shown that the proposed feature fusion method significantly improves the prognosis performance for overall survival in resectable PDAC cohorts, elevating the area under ROC curve by 51% compared to predefined radiomics features alone, by 16% compared to deep learning features alone, and by 32% compared to existing feature fusion and reduction methods for a combination of deep learning and predefined radiomics features.","Yucheng Zhang,Yucheng Zhang,Edrise M.

,,,Improving Prognostic Value of CT Deep Radiomic Features in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Using Transfer Learning.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive cancers with an extremely poor prognosis. Radiomics has shown prognostic ability in multiple types of cancer including PDAC. However, the prognostic value of traditional radiomics pipelines, which are based on hand-crafted radiomic features alone, is limited due to multicollinearity of features and multiple testing problem, and limited performance of conventional machine learning classifiers. Deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been shown to outperform traditional techniques in computer vision tasks, such as object detection. However, they require large sample sizes for training which limits their development. As an alternative solution, CNN-based transfer learning has shown the potential for achieving reasonable performance using datasets with small sample sizes. In this work, we developed a CNN-based transfer learning approach for prognostication in PDAC patients for overall survival. The results showed that transfer learning approach outperformed the traditional radiomics model on PDAC data. A transfer learning approach may fill the gap between radiomics and deep learning analytics for cancer prognosis and improve performance beyond what CNNs can achieve using small datasets.","Yucheng Zhang,Edrise M.

It seeks to take full advantage of all the information contained in multiple medical imaging modalities. With a radiomics approach, medical images are not limited to providing only a qualitative assessment but can also provide quantitative data by parameterizing image features. These parameters can be used to identify regions and volumes of interest and discriminate normal healthy tissue from abnormal or diseased tissue. Radiomics is an interlinked sequence of processes of vital importance that begins with the acquisition and selection of medical images that involve standardization of acquisition protocols and inter-equipment normalization. This is followed by the identification and segmentation of regions or volumes of interest by expert radiologists through the use of computational tools that offer speed while reducing variability and bias. The segmentation process is the most critical stage in radiomics. This sometimes requires the incorporation of a pre-processing stage consisting of advanced techniques (reconstruction processes, filtering, etc.). Thereafter, representative characteristics of the region or volume of interest are extracted by approaches based on statistics, morphological features, and transform-based variables. Next, a statistical selection of the parameters that provide a high association and correlation with the clinical condition of interest is performed. Finally, processes such as data integration, standardization, classification, and mining processes can be applied as needed for particular applications. Ongoing research in radiomics aims to reduce the time and costs involved in interpreting medical images while simultaneously increasing the quality of diagnoses and monitoring of as well as the selection of treatment strategies. The results of many studies combining radiomics with standard medical techniques are highly encouraging, and these new approaches are increasingly used. This review article details the components of radiomics and discusses its applications, challenges, and future directions for this exciting new field of study.","Edward Florez,Edward Florez,Ali Fatemi,Ali Fatemi,Pier Paolo Claudio,Pier Paolo Claudio,Candace M.

,,,Perturb-and-MPM: Quantifying Segmentation Uncertainty in Dense Multi-Label CRFs.,"This paper proposes a novel approach for uncertainty quantification in dense Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). The presented approach, called Perturb-and-MPM, enables efficient, approximate sampling from dense multi-label CRFs via random perturbations. An analytic error analysis was performed which identified the main cause of approximation error as well as showed that the error is bounded. Spatial uncertainty maps can be derived from the Perturb-and-MPM model, which can be used to visualize uncertainty in image segmentation results. The method is validated on synthetic and clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging data. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on the challenging problem of segmenting the tumor core in glioblastoma. We found that areas of high uncertainty correspond well to wrongly segmented image regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential use of uncertainty maps to refine imaging biomarkers in the case of extent of resection and residual tumor volume in brain tumor patients.","Raphael Meier,Raphael Meier,Urspeter Knecht,Urspeter Knecht,Alain Jungo,Roland Wiest,Alain Jungo,Mauricio Reyes,Roland Wiest,Mauricio Reyes",arXiv: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,2017.0
,,,Predicting Lung Nodule Malignancies by Combining Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Handcrafted Features,"To predict lung nodule malignancy with a high sensitivity and specificity, we propose a fusion algorithm that combines handcrafted features (HF) into the features learned at the output layer of a 3D deep convolutional neural network (CNN). First, we extracted twenty-nine handcrafted features, including nine intensity features, eight geometric features, and twelve texture features based on grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) averaged from thirteen directions. We then trained 3D CNNs modified from three state-of-the-art 2D CNN architectures (AlexNet, VGG-16 Net and Multi-crop Net) to extract the CNN features learned at the output layer. For each 3D CNN, the CNN features combined with the 29 handcrafted features were used as the input for the support vector machine (SVM) coupled with the sequential forward feature selection (SFS) method to select the optimal feature subset and construct the classifiers. The fusion algorithm takes full advantage of the handcrafted features and the highest level CNN features learned at the output layer. It can overcome the disadvantage of the handcrafted features that may not fully reflect the unique characteristics of a particular lesion by combining the intrinsic CNN features. Meanwhile, it also alleviates the requirement of a large scale annotated dataset for the CNNs based on the complementary of handcrafted features. The patient cohort includes 431 malignant nodules and 795 benign nodules extracted from the LIDC/IDRI database. For each investigated CNN architecture, the proposed fusion algorithm achieved the highest AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity scores among all competitive classification models.","Shulong Li,Panpan Xu,Shulong Li,Bin Li,Panpan Xu,Liyuan Chen,Bin Li,Zhiguo Zhou,Liyuan Chen,Hongxia Hao,Zhiguo Zhou,Hongxia Hao,Hongxia Hao,Yingying Duan,Yingying Duan,Michael R.

,,,Task adapted reconstruction for inverse problems,"The paper considers the problem of performing a task defined on a model parameter that is only observed indirectly through noisy data in an ill-posed inverse problem. A key aspect is to formalize the steps of reconstruction and task as appropriate estimators (non-randomized decision rules) in statistical estimation problems. The implementation makes use of (deep) neural networks to provide a differentiable parametrization of the family of estimators for both steps. These networks are combined and jointly trained against suitable supervised training data in order to minimize a joint differentiable loss function, resulting in an end-to-end task adapted reconstruction method. The suggested framework is generic, yet adaptable, with a plug-and-play structure for adjusting both the inverse problem and the task at hand. More precisely, the data model (forward operator and statistical model of the noise) associated with the inverse problem is exchangeable, e.g., by using neural network architecture given by a learned iterative method. Furthermore, any task that is encodable as a trainable neural network can be used. The approach is demonstrated on joint tomographic image reconstruction, classification and joint tomographic image reconstruction segmentation.","Jonas Adler,Jonas Adler,Sebastian Lunz,Sebastian Lunz,Olivier Verdier,Olivier Verdier,Carola‐Bibiane Schönlieb,Olivier Verdier,Ozan Öktem,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb,Ozan Öktem",arXiv: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,2018.0

We evaluated the capacity of radiomics features to add complementary information to  MGMT  status, to improve the ability to predict prognosis.    Methods:  159 patients with untreated GBM were included in this study and divided into training and independent test sets. 286 radiomics features were extracted from the magnetic resonance images acquired prior to any treatments. A least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) selection followed by Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine the prognostic value of radiomics features to predict overall survival (OS). The combination of  MGMT  status with radiomics was also investigated and all results were validated on the independent test set.    Results:  LASSO analysis identified 8 out of the 286 radiomic features to be relevant which were then used for determining association to OS. One feature (edge descriptor) remained significant on the external validation cohort after multiple testing (p=0.04) and the combination with  MGMT  identified a group of patients with the best prognosis with a survival probability of 0.61 after 43 months (p=0.0005).    Conclusion:  Our results suggest that combining radiomics with  MGMT  is more accurate in stratifying patients into groups of different survival risks when compared to with using these predictors in isolation. We identified two subgroups within patients who have methylated  MGMT : one with a similar survival to unmethylated  MGMT  patients and the other with a significantly longer OS.","Florent Tixier,Florent Tixier,Florent Tixier,Hyemin Um,Hyemin Um,Dalton Bermudez,Dalton Bermudez,Aditi Iyer,Aditi Iyer,Aditya Apte,Aditya Apte,A.

So far, this problem has mainly been tackled in test-retest analyses. In this work we analyze radiomics feature stability based on probabilistic automated segmentation hypotheses. Based on a public lung cancer dataset, we generate an arbitrary number of plausible segmentations using a Probabilistic U-Net. From these segmentations, we extract a high number of plausible feature vectors for each lung tumor and analyze feature variance with respect to the segmentations. Our results suggest that there are groups of radiomic features that are more (e.g. statistics features) and less (e.g. gray-level size zone matrix features) robust against segmentation variability.

Methods: Four scanners were used to acquire SPECT scans of a cardiac phantom with 5mCi of 99mTc. The effects of different image acquisition and reconstruction settings including the Number of View, View Matrix Size, attenuation correction, image reconstruction algorithm, number of iterations, number of subsets, type of filter, full width at half maximum (FWHM) of Gaussian filter, Butterworth filter order, and Butterworth filter cut-off were studied. In total 5263 different images were reconstructed. Eighty-seven radiomic features including first, second, and high order textures were extracted from images. To assess reproducibility and repeatability the coefficient of variation (COV) was used for each image feature over the different imaging settings.  Result: IDMN and IDN features from GLCM, RP from GLRLM, ZE from GLSZM, and DE from GLDM feature sets were the only features that were the most reproducible (COV  20 ) against changes in all imaging settings. Matrix size has the greatest impact on feature variability as most of features are not repeatable and 82.76 of them had (COV>20 ).  Conclusion: Repeatability and reproducibility of SPECT radiomics texture features in different imaging settings is feature-dependent, and different image acquisitions and reconstructions have different effects on radiomics texture features.

,31392079.0,,Radiomics signature for the preoperative assessment of stage in advanced colon cancer.,"The purpose of this study was to develop a radiomics signature for distinguishing stage in advanced colon cancer (CC). 195 colon cancer patients were enrolled in this study (stage III, n = 146 vs. stage IV, n = 49) and divided into training cohort (n = 136) and validation cohort (n = 59). A total of 286 radiomic features were extracted from tumor and LN images. A radiomics signature was generated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) technique. The relationship between radiomics signature and CC staging was explored using a kernel-based support vector machine (SVM) classifier model. The classification performance was assessed by accuracy and the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. A total of 5 features (2 for tumor and 3 for LN) were selected among 286 features. Radiomics signature built from extracted features successfully differentiated stage III from stage IV CC with no known distant metastases on imaging preoperatively. Furthermore, the SVM classifier model generated using tumor and LN images together achieved better performance than the tumor alone, with accuracies of 86.03% vs. 78.68% and 83.05% vs. 76.27% in training and validation cohorts, respectively. In ROC analysis, the model showed a significant improvement for training (AUC 89.16% vs. 69.5%) and validation cohorts (AUC 75.15% vs. 55%) in comparison with the combined analysis and the tumor alone. In conclusion, the radiomics signature based on preoperative CT may distinguish stage III from stage IV CC with no known distant metastases. In addition, the radiomic features from combined images achieved better classification performance than tumor alone.","Yu Li,Yu Li,Yu Li,Aydın Eresen,Yu Li,Yu Li,Aydin Eresen,Yun Lu,Jia Yang,Yun Lu,Jia Yang,Junjie Shangguan,Yuri S.

The method combines filter, wrapper and embedded selection in a comprehensive process to identify useful features and build them into a potentially predictive signature. The results showed that non-invasive CT radiomics were able to moderately predict overall survival and predict WHO tumour grade. This study reveals an associative inter-relationship between WHO tumour grade, CT-based radiomics and survival, that could be clinically relevant.","Zhenwei Shi,Chong Zhang,Zhenwei Shi,Zhenwei Shi,Inge Compter,Chong Zhang,Inge Compter,Maikel Verduin,M.

,,,MIXCAPS: A Capsule Network-based Mixture of Experts for Lung Nodule Malignancy Prediction,"Lung diseases including infections such as Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, and novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), together with Lung Cancer are significantly widespread and are, typically, considered life threatening. In particular, lung cancer is among the most common and deadliest cancers with a low 5-year survival rate. Timely diagnosis of lung cancer is, therefore, of paramount importance as it can save countless lives. In this regard, deep learning radiomics solutions have the promise of extracting the most useful features on their own in an end-to-end fashion without having access to the annotated boundaries. Among different deep learning models, Capsule Networks are proposed to overcome shortcomings of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) such as their inability to recognize detailed spatial relations. Capsule networks have so far shown satisfying performance in medical imaging problems. Capitalizing on their success, in this study, we propose a novel capsule network-based mixture of experts, referred to as the MIXCAPS. The proposed MIXCAPS architecture takes advantage of not only the capsule network's capabilities to handle small datasets, but also automatically splitting dataset through a convolutional gating network. MIXCAPS enables capsule network experts to specialize on different subsets of the data. Our results show that MIXCAPS outperforms a single capsule network and a mixture of CNNs, with an accuracy of 92.88%, sensitivity of 93.2%, specificity of 92.3% and area under the curve of 0.963. Our experiments also show that there is a relation between the gate outputs and a couple of hand-crafted features, illustrating explainable nature of the proposed MIXCAPS. To further evaluate generalization capabilities of the proposed MIXCAPS architecture, additional experiments on a brain tumor dataset are performed showing potentials of MIXCAPS for detection of tumors related to other organs.","Parnian Afshar,Farnoosh Naderkhani,Parnian Afshar,Farnoosh Naderkhani,Anastasia Oikonomou,Farnoosh Naderkhani,Anastasia Oikonomou,Moezedin Javad Rafiee,Anastasia Oikonomou,Arash Mohammadi,Moezedin Javad Rafiee,Konstantinos N.

,32905456.0,,Applications of radiomics in genitourinary tumors.,"Genitourinary tumors are heterogeneous groups of tumors with high morbidity and mortality rates. Confronted with existing problems in the management of genitourinary tumors, a personalized imaging method called radiomics shows great potential in areas including detection, grading, and treatment response assessment. Radiomics is characterized by extraction of quantitative imaging features which are not visible to the naked eye from conventional imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), followed by data analysis and model building. It outperforms other invasive methods in terms of non-invasiveness, low cost and high efficiency. Recently, a number of studies have evaluated the application of radiomics in patients with genitourinary tumors with promising data. The combination of radiomics and clinical/laboratory factors provides added value in many studies. Despite this, there are limitations and challenges to be overcome before a more extensive clinical application in the future. In this article, we will introduce the concept, significance and workflow of radiomics, review their current applications in patients with genitourinary tumors and discuss limitations and future directions of radiomics. It would help multidisciplinary team involved in the treatment of patients with genitourinary tumors to achieve a better understanding of the results of radiomics study toward a personalized medicine.","Longfei Liu,Longfei Liu,Xiaoping Yi,Can Lü,Xiaoping Yi,Lin Qi,Can Lu,Lin Qi,Youming Zhang,Youming Zhang,Minghao Li,Qiao Xiao,Minghao Li,Cikui Wang,Qiao Xiao,Liang Zhang,Cikui Wang,Yingxian Pang,Liang Zhang,Yingxian Pang,Yong Wang,Yong Wang,Xiao Guan,Xiao Guan",American Journal of Cancer Research,2020.0

This study proposes a new dynamic radiomics feature extraction workflow that uses time-dependent tomographic images of the same patient, focuses on the changes in image features over time, and then quantifies them as new dynamic features for diagnostic or prognostic evaluation. We first define the mathematical paradigm of dynamic radiomics and introduce three specific methods that can describe the transformation process of features over time.

,,,A Bayesian Nonparametric model for textural pattern heterogeneity,"Cancer radiomics is an emerging discipline promising to elucidate lesion phenotypes and tumor heterogeneity through patterns of enhancement, texture, morphology, and shape. The prevailing technique for image texture analysis relies on the construction and synthesis of Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM). Practice currently reduces the structured count data of a GLCM to reductive and redundant summary statistics for which analysis requires variable selection and multiple comparisons for each application, thus limiting reproducibility. In this article, we develop a Bayesian multivariate probabilistic framework for the analysis and unsupervised clustering of a sample of GLCM objects. By appropriately accounting for skewness and zero-inflation of the observed counts and simultaneously adjusting for existing spatial autocorrelation at nearby cells, the methodology facilitates estimation of texture pattern distributions within the GLCM lattice itself. The techniques are applied to cluster images of adrenal lesions obtained from CT scans with and without administration of contrast. We further assess whether the resultant subtypes are clinically oriented by investigating their correspondence with pathological diagnoses. Additionally, we compare performance to a class of machine-learning approaches currently used in cancer radiomics with simulation studies.","Li Xiao,Michele Guindani,Xiao Li,Chaan S.

,,,AMINN: Autoencoder-based Multiple Instance Neural Network Improves Outcome Prediction of Multifocal Liver Metastases,"Colorectal cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers and colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM) is the major cause of death in patients with colorectal cancer. Multifocality occurs frequently in CRLM, but is relatively unexplored in CRLM outcome prediction. Most existing clinical and imaging biomarkers do not take the imaging features of all multifocal lesions into account. In this paper, we present an end-to-end autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network (AMINN) for the prediction of survival outcomes in multifocal CRLM patients using radiomic features extracted from contrast-enhanced MRIs. Specifically, we jointly train an autoencoder to reconstruct input features and a multiple instance network to make predictions by aggregating information from all tumour lesions of a patient. In addition, we incorporate a two-step normalization technique to improve the training of deep neural networks, built on the observation that the distributions of radiomic features are almost always severely skewed. Experimental results empirically validated our hypothesis that incorporating imaging features of all lesions improves outcome prediction for multifocal cancer. The proposed ADMINN framework achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.70, which is 19.5% higher than baseline methods. We built a risk score based on the outputs of our network and compared it to other clinical and imaging biomarkers. Our risk score is the only one that achieved statistical significance in univariate and multivariate cox proportional hazard modeling in our cohort of multifocal CRLM patients. The effectiveness of incorporating all lesions and applying two-step normalization is demonstrated by a series of ablation studies. Our code will be released after the peer-review process.","Jianan Chen,Jianan Chen,Jianan Chen,Helen Cheung,Laurent Milot,Helen M. C. Cheung,Anne L. Martel,Laurent Milot,Anne L.

However, noninvasively determination of EGFR mutation status before targeted therapy remains a challenge. This study constructed a nomogram based on a combination of radiomics features with the clinical and radiological features to predict the EGFR mutation status. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Wilcoxon test were used for feature selection. Decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were used for radiomics model building. Used the clinical and radiological features establish clinical-radiology (C-R) model. The C-R model with the best radiomics model to establish clinical-radiological-radiomics (C-R-R) model. The predictive performance of the model was evaluated by ROC and calibration curves, and the clinical usefulness was assessed by a decision curve analysis. The current study showed that twelve radiomics features were significantly associated with EGFR mutations. The best radiomics signature model was obtained using the SVM classifier. The C-R-R model had the best distinguishing ability for predicting the EGFR mutation status, with an AUC of 0.849 (95% CI, 0.805-0.893) and 0.835 (95% CI, 0.761-0.909) in the development and validation cohorts, respectively.

,,,Imbalance-Aware Self-Supervised Learning for 3D Radiomic Representations,"Radiomic representations can quantify properties of regions of interest in medical image data. Classically, they account for pre-defined statistics of shape, texture, and other low-level image features. Alternatively, deep learning-based representations are derived from supervised learning but require expensive annotations from experts and often suffer from overfitting and data imbalance issues. In this work, we address the challenge of learning representations of 3D medical images for an effective quantification under data imbalance. We propose a \emph{self-supervised} representation learning framework to learn high-level features of 3D volumes as a complement to existing radiomics features. Specifically, we demonstrate how to learn image representations in a self-supervised fashion using a 3D Siamese network. More importantly, we deal with data imbalance by exploiting two unsupervised strategies: a) sample re-weighting, and b) balancing the composition of training batches. When combining our learned self-supervised feature with traditional radiomics, we show significant improvement in brain tumor classification and lung cancer staging tasks covering MRI and CT imaging modalities.","Hongwei Li,Hongwei Li,Fei-Fei Xue,Fei-Fei Xue,Krishna Chaitanya,Krishna Chaitanya,Shengda Luo,Ivan Ezhov,Shengda Luo,Shengda Liu,Ivan Ezhov,Benedikt Wiestler,Benedikt Wiestler,Jianguo Zhang,Jianguo Zhang,Bjoern H.

,,,"Parallel Medical Imaging for Intelligent Medical Image Analysis: Concepts, Methods, and Applications","There has been much progress in data-driven artificial intelligence technology for medical image analysis in the last decades. However, it still remains challenging due to its distinctive complexity of acquiring and annotating image data, extracting medical domain knowledge, and explaining the diagnostic decision for medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose a data-knowledge-driven framework termed as Parallel Medical Imaging (PMI) for intelligent medical image analysis based on the methodology of interactive ACP-based parallel intelligence. In the PMI framework, computational experiments with predictive learning in a data-driven way are conducted to extract medical knowledge for diagnostic decision support. Artificial imaging systems are introduced to select and prescriptively generate medical image data in a knowledge-driven way to utilize medical domain knowledge. Through the closed-loop optimization based on parallel execution, our proposed PMI framework can boost the generalization ability and alleviate the limitation of medical interpretation for diagnostic decisions. Furthermore, we illustrate the preliminary implementation of PMI method through the case studies of mammogram analysis and skin lesion image analysis. Experimental results on several public medical image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed PMI.","Chao Gou,Chao Gou,Tianyu Shen,Wenbo Zheng,Tianyu Shen,Wenbo Zheng,Huadan Xue,Wenbo Zheng,Huadan Xue,Hui Yu,Qiang Ji,Hui Yu,Qiang Ji,Zhengyu Jin,Fei‐Yue Wang,Zhengyu Jin,Fei-Yue Wang",arXiv: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,2021.0
,,,A transformer-based deep learning approach for classifying brain metastases into primary organ sites using clinical whole brain MRI images.,"The treatment decisions for brain metastatic disease are driven by knowledge of the primary organ site cancer histology, often requiring invasive biopsy. This study aims to develop a novel deep learning approach for accurate and rapid non-invasive identification of brain metastatic tumor histology with conventional whole-brain MRI. The use of clinical whole-brain data and the end-to-end pipeline obviate external human intervention. This IRB-approved single-site retrospective study was comprised of patients (n=1,293) referred for MRI treatment-planning and gamma knife radiosurgery from July 2000 to May 2019. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted contrast enhanced and T2-weighted-Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery brain MRI exams (n=1,428) were minimally preprocessed (voxel resolution unification and signal-intensity rescaling/normalization), requiring only seconds per an MRI scan, and input into the proposed deep learning workflow for tumor segmentation, modality transfer, and primary site classification associated with brain metastatic disease in one of four classes (lung, melanoma, renal, and other). Ten-fold cross-validation generated the overall AUC of 0.941, lung class AUC of 0.899, melanoma class AUC of 0.882, renal class AUC of 0.870, and other class AUC of 0.885. It is convincingly established that whole-brain imaging features would be sufficiently discriminative to allow accurate diagnosis of the primary organ site of malignancy. Our end-to-end deep learning-based radiomic method has a great translational potential for classifying metastatic tumor types using whole-brain MRI images, without additional human intervention. Further refinement may offer invaluable tools to expedite primary organ site cancer identification for treatment of brain metastatic disease and improvement of patient outcomes and survival.","Qing Lyu,Qing Lyu,Sanjeev V.

,,,Reproducible radiomics through automated machine learning validated on twelve clinical applications,"Radiomics uses quantitative medical imaging features to predict clinical outcomes. While many radiomics methods have been described in the literature, these are generally designed for a single application. The aim of this study is to generalize radiomics across applications by proposing a framework to automatically construct and optimize the radiomics workflow per application. To this end, we formulate radiomics as a modular workflow, consisting of several components: image and segmentation preprocessing, feature extraction, feature and sample preprocessing, and machine learning. For each component, a collection of common algorithms is included. To optimize the workflow per application, we employ automated machine learning using a random search and ensembling. We evaluate our method in twelve different clinical applications, resulting in the following area under the curves: 1) liposarcoma (0.83); 2) desmoid-type fibromatosis (0.82); 3) primary liver tumors (0.81); 4) gastrointestinal stromal tumors (0.77); 5) colorectal liver metastases (0.68); 6) melanoma metastases (0.51); 7) hepatocellular carcinoma (0.75); 8) mesenteric fibrosis (0.81); 9) prostate cancer (0.72); 10) glioma (0.70); 11) Alzheimer's disease (0.87); and 12) head and neck cancer (0.84). Concluding, our method fully automatically constructs and optimizes the radiomics workflow, thereby streamlining the search for radiomics biomarkers in new applications.
